<seg id="1">recalling a very American ideal that labor rights are human rights </seg>
<seg id="2">congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have offered the bill , on which the trade unions is a civil right . </seg>
<seg id="3">&quot; where trade unions that are there and the jobs of the middle class , &quot; says Ellison , Democrat of Minnesota , who is co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive factions . </seg>
<seg id="4">that is why I am proud to represent the Act of expanding the rights of workers , along with the symbol of the movement for civil rights by John Lewis . </seg>
<seg id="5">this bill will give workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination against organizations , trade unions , and other forms of discrimination , stopping force opponents to unions </seg>
<seg id="6">changing the Act regulating labour relations in such a way as to allow the workers encountering discrimination for participating in organizations , trade unions , to seek justice in the civil courts &quot; and to receive compensation for damages and punitive payments - a sensible and necessary initiative . </seg>
<seg id="7">but it &apos;s certainly not radical initiative - at least by American standards . </seg>
<seg id="8">in fact , the best way to deal with the fact that offer Ellison , Lewis and co-authors of the bill , &quot; recall is a very American idea . </seg>
<seg id="9">despite the attacks , which the unions have in recent years - in Wisconsin , Michigan and other states across the country , Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt , to expand and to respect human rights . </seg>
<seg id="10">there was a time , which is still remembered by millions of Americans , when this country simultaneously defend democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right to organize . </seg>
<seg id="11">when the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War , General Douglas MacArthur was ready and his assistants have helped the country to adopt a constitution , so , in order to guarantee that which autocracy Хидеки Тодзё was replaced by democracy . </seg>
<seg id="12">fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan , they included a text that explicitly admitted that &quot; the right of workers to organize and to negotiate , and the collective action is guaranteed . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="13">when the United States occupied Germany after World War II , General Dwight David Эйзенхауер and his assistants have helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that fascism Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy . </seg>
<seg id="14">recognizing that workers will need to be organized and to be heard in the new state , Germans have included an article that openly stated : &quot; the right to establish associations in order to protect and improve employment and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity . </seg>
<seg id="15">agreements that restrict or seek to diminish that right , will have no legal force ; measures for these purposes , be declared illegal . </seg>
<seg id="16">when former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was president of the International Commission on Human Rights , which was World Declaration on Human Rights , which in 1948 , will be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement , Roosevelt and the included a guarantee that &quot; everyone has the right to organize and join unions to protect their interests . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="17">generations of Americans take for granted our basic position that labor rights are human rights . </seg>
<seg id="18">when this country is advised by other countries about how to create a civil and democratic society , Americans have explained that the right to organize labor unions - and the fact that this union has participated as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - should be protected . </seg>
<seg id="19">now , when these rights are under attack in America , wise , indeed , return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to ensure that their voices were heard in a free and open society . </seg>

<seg id="2">in the U.S. , a federal judge on Sunday temporarily has blocked the enactment of law in Louisiana , which his supporters say he likely will close all five абортных clinics in the state . </seg>
<seg id="3">according to this measure , which was signed by Governor of Louisiana Bobby Джинадлом in June and was supposed to go into effect on September 1 , doctors who do abortions , were obliged to have powers of patients in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice . </seg>

<seg id="5">&quot; complainants will be allowed to work legally , continuing actions to gain power , &quot; he wrote in his decision , Judge John деГрэвеллз . </seg>
<seg id="6">the hearing will be scheduled within the next month , at which the judge made a more permanent solution on this law . </seg>
<seg id="7">abortion-rights advocates abortion with joy were met by this decision , the last in a chain of decisions against similar measures , saying this will give doctors more time to obtain hospital authority . </seg>
<seg id="8">&quot; today &apos;s decision ensures that the women of Louisiana will be protected from Industies Law , which seeks to deprive them of the health and human rights , &quot; said Nancy Нортап , president and head of the Center for reproductive Rights , which filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the five clinics . </seg>
<seg id="9">it was not immediately clear whether a decision to doctors from two clinics , which were claimants in the case , and have also submitted a statement to authorities . </seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of the 11 states that have adopted similar laws , and the courts have recently acknowledged such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi . </seg>
<seg id="11">key parts of the техасского law that has closed the majority of the remaining clinics in this state , were blocked by a federal judge on Friday . </seg>
<seg id="12">fighters for the right to abortion , along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association say that the laws of the receiving impose on doctors the restrictions which are not necessary from the medical point of view . </seg>
<seg id="13">opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women &apos;s health , though some also pointed to positive effect in the closing clinics . </seg>

<seg id="1">what will the introduction of quotas for domestic products </seg>
<seg id="2">not less than half of products for each type of product in the range trading networks should be the Russian production , says MP Duma from the faction of A Just Russia , Oleg Nilov . </seg>
<seg id="3">the MP has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures for domestic manufacturers , writes the newspaper Izvestia . </seg>
<seg id="4">the document will still some points , in order to avoid possible discomfort to buyers . </seg>
<seg id="5">this applies to goods that are produced in Russia . &lt; ... &gt; According to the rest of the groups of products , which are produced in Russia , Vester will provide at least half of their shelves domestic manufacturers , &quot; Nilov . </seg>
<seg id="6">together with the amendments , in the article &quot; On the basis of state regulation of trading activities in the Russian Federation , &quot; the bill provides for the introduction of changes to the Tax Code , laying down lines rate VAT 10 % for products produced in Russia . </seg>
<seg id="7">the idea to introduce a 50 % -процентную quota in retail chains included in the stimulus package for Russian producers . </seg>
<seg id="8">the shop appears several times more than domestic goods . </seg>
<seg id="9">however , this initiative can have both positive and negative effects , experts say . </seg>
<seg id="10">according to attorney Налоговик &quot; , a member of the independent think-tank &quot; Public Duma Sergei Litvinenko for the Russian economy , as well as for domestic agricultural and food industries , the effect will be positive , and will lead to growth . </seg>
<seg id="11">the winners will be key , farmers , and small shops . </seg>
<seg id="12">they will be able to sell more , and that means that profits will grow . </seg>
<seg id="13">in addition , they will receive the right to dictate retailers their conditions and prices , because they will be forced to buy their goods . </seg>
<seg id="14">Russian manufacturers will be able to increase their activity and sales that would pay higher taxes than before . </seg>
<seg id="15">this will increase budget revenues , create new jobs , industries will grow any faster осваиваться , will have made a contribution to GDP growth . </seg>
<seg id="16">Russia &apos;s dependence on foreign food fall a few times , but not immediately , &quot; said the expert . </seg>
<seg id="17">earlier , Russian companies are often unable to fight their way to the shelves of local stores due to higher competition from foreign counterparts . </seg>
<seg id="18">now , after the introduction of the embargo , this niche freed , and you can breathe a sigh of relief . </seg>
<seg id="19">but do not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary inspections to the Russian market will be available food from Latin America , Turkey and Serbia . </seg>
<seg id="20">in other words , it is now &quot; a moment of calm , when the former players have already left , and new has yet to come . </seg>
<seg id="21">after almost a month , you can talk about modern demand for Russian raw materials , as well as rising prices for finished products , &quot; said АиФ.ru first Vice President of Russian public institutions , &quot; the Russian club finance directors , Tamara Kasyanov . </seg>
<seg id="22">clearly , the idea of selling in each category at least 50 % of the Russian food products will be the sector for local producers . </seg>
<seg id="23">in that case , they will have to compete with one another , not with products , which financed subsidies of other countries , are cheaper . </seg>
<seg id="24">in other words , the buyer will unfold between the companies that operate under a single law . </seg>
<seg id="25">on the other hand , says Kasyanov , Russian producers are able to meet 50 % of domestic needs compatriots not on all items . </seg>
<seg id="26">and in this situation commercial networks will have &quot; дотягивать &quot; share of Russian goods up to half that range . </seg>
<seg id="27">in this context , increasing fears that the president will be substandard goods . </seg>
<seg id="28">maybe , under the guise of manufactured in Russia , will be delivered to foreign products with перебитыми labels , &quot; adds an expert . </seg>
<seg id="29">a negative effect of introducing quotas are large trading networks , especially those which выгодней cooperate with importers . </seg>

<seg id="31">Litvinenko did not rule out that the law on quotas on domestic goods may impact on consumers . </seg>
<seg id="32">the fact that some products of the Russian production can yield quality imported ones , while shops will be boosting prices on the second as a scarce commodity . </seg>
<seg id="33">about revolutions in the early 2000s , the idea of import substitution economists again spoke in February this year because of the ongoing devaluation of the ruble . </seg>

<seg id="1">inflation out of the vacation . </seg>
<seg id="2">feel whether Russians soaring prices </seg>
<seg id="3">as a result of the November sanctions of Russia and the West , inflation in Russia will not уложится in predictions of the authorities , convinced analysts , &quot; VTB Capital . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="4">according to experts , the deferred effects антисанкций will lead to inflationary early in the first quarter of 2015 , writes RBC Daily . </seg>
<seg id="5">according to the latest forecast , in 2014 , inflation will be 6,5-7,5 percent next year and to less than 6.5 percent . </seg>
<seg id="6">however , according to the newspaper , &quot; Kommersant , &quot; this week &apos;s ministry will bring &quot; small but significant &quot; changes in macroeconomic forecast up to 2017 . </seg>
<seg id="7">according to the publication , the agency may lower estimate of inflation in 2015 , which will eliminate the expected progeSOFT income growth . </seg>
<seg id="8">the forecast suggested that food sanctions Russia act a year - until August 2015 . </seg>
<seg id="9">in such a situation , you could assume such high inflation ? </seg>
<seg id="10">the current situation involves geared shock , but понижательный trend of inflation does not change , &quot; said the source of the newspaper to . </seg>
<seg id="11">economists from VTB Capital &quot; don &apos;t share expectations economic bloc governments regarding inflation and the forecast price growth in 2014 at the level of 8 % . </seg>
<seg id="12">the main effect of product bans will come together with the possible introduction in the regions of sales tax ( GAP ) in 2015 , believe the experts . </seg>
<seg id="13">inflationary peak at 9 per cent in February , after which the annual pace of price growth will decline , experts believe . </seg>
<seg id="14">incidentally , last week , Rosstat , let the first inflation results , after Russia introduced the &quot; neat sanctions . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="15">АиФ.ru interviewed experts and found their inflationary expectations . </seg>
<seg id="16">Artem Деев , head of the analytical department of FC AForex : </seg>
<seg id="17">prices have already observed in key segments . </seg>
<seg id="18">moreover , when I began to appreciate the socially relevant products , the government was forced to launch measures of systematic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risk of unjustified price increases in the short term . </seg>
<seg id="19">suppliers and retailers already report on a daily basis before regulators that authorities knew exactly who , where and for what reason will trigger an increase in prices . </seg>
<seg id="20">key factors for the growth of the consumer price index continues to be tremendous pace of capital flight , excessive refinancing the banking sector from the Russian мегарегулятора , internal converting due to escape in foreign currency , as well as an embargo on the import of food products from the countries that joined the sanctions against Russia . </seg>
<seg id="21">if inflationary pressures remained under control , the cost of a basket of a minimum set of products not jumped to 12 per cent for one , only a quarter . </seg>
<seg id="22">a ban on the import of food products provoked shock proposals on the internal market and led to the utterly логичному increase the final cost . </seg>
<seg id="23">because at this stage we are not able to fully run the mechanism of import substitution , and increase self-sufficiency of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production , retaliatory sanctions continue to bear the risks of rising inflationary component . </seg>
<seg id="24">if you add one and fiscal reasons related to the lack of credibility of the national currency , as well as ухудшенными prospects for economic growth , by the end of this year , inflation could exceed 8 % . </seg>
<seg id="25">Alexander Разуваев , director of the analytical department &quot; Alpari . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="26">in the 1990s , inflation sometimes hit 20-30 % per month to zero , it was also higher than the current level , another thing that then it offset faster economic growth . </seg>
<seg id="27">I think , at the end of the year inflation will be 8-8,5 % . </seg>
<seg id="28">Plato Магута , managing assets of the Fund Магута . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="29">an external factor associated with sanctions against Russia , while successfully contained , but if there is a further increase of the pressure , first and foremost , for the financial sector - this can lead to certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations of population which traditionally occur in interest-bearing cash currency to protect their savings . </seg>
<seg id="30">it can be assumed that the government , the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance will mitigate the gradual weakening of the ruble , as market practices and government regulation . </seg>
<seg id="31">but the rise in prices begins traditionally after a lull over the summer and , possibly , this fall will become more pronounced . </seg>
<seg id="32">the target level of consumer inflation in Russia to 7.5 % , most likely , a weapon , as Russia has another financial savings . </seg>

<seg id="1">the estimates of construction projects in the Russian Federation will be anew </seg>
<seg id="2">issues of pricing , regulation of the construction industry , as well as problems of connectivity the Federal Antimonopoly Service takes on a special control . </seg>
<seg id="3">under FAS created expert advice on the development of competition in the construction sector . </seg>
<seg id="4">at its meeting , the head of the management control , utilities , construction , and natural resources FAS Vadim Solovyov said that &quot; today &apos;s calculation estimates of construction sites is absolutely unintelligible . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="5">regulatory environment makes pricing opaque and could lead to an unjustified price construction , the FAS . </seg>
<seg id="6">and the cost of the construction of state property in the design stage to determine on the basis of the market prices of constructive solutions , instead of used today estimated norms and supermarket pricing on technological operations . </seg>
<seg id="7">the proposals made in the &quot; road map &quot; and are now under consideration in минстрое . </seg>
<seg id="8">&quot; replacing the traditional documentation in construction in the settlements of constructive elements should lead to less corruption in the industry , &quot; explained &quot; RSL &quot; Vadim Solovyov . </seg>
<seg id="9">because now the company обсчитывается every bolt and nut , and not always to everyone to check , so sometimes the unscrupulous construction companies can mid fill &quot; whole tractor . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="10">in минстрое with FAS agree . </seg>
<seg id="11">&quot; the first developments for the calculation of the value of the constructive elements already have : developed methods for the calculation of prices for constructive solutions , budgeting for these indicators , &quot; said &quot; RSL &quot; head of the department of urban planning and architecture минстроя Elena Zhukova . </seg>
<seg id="12">as the pilot selected area of road construction . </seg>
<seg id="13">however , experts believe that the problem is much more serious . </seg>
<seg id="14">both told the &quot; RSL &quot; head of a construction company , &quot; Профи-инвест Anatoly Демьянко , estimates Verde is long out of date , but another mechanism for business unless invited . </seg>
<seg id="15">&quot; as regards the proposed settlements on the constructive elements , but in practice this is implementable , because the building has often used different technologies , &quot; he said . </seg>
<seg id="16">it is no secret that стройрынок develops , thanks largely to the госзаказу . </seg>
<seg id="17">according to the Chairman of the Management Board of the NP &quot; Экспертное community professionals procurement &quot; Catherine Лезиной , today , the state is the most effective customer . </seg>
<seg id="18">deputy director of the pharmaceutical industry center of capital construction , Rosatom Vladimir Malakhov drew attention to the fact that today &apos;s market is nominally divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts , and the company that owns монопольными competence and does not allow for this field of competitors . </seg>
<seg id="19">he believes that the creation of a transparent market is only possible when access to contracts will make Turkey from someone &apos;s manager . </seg>
<seg id="20">the expert council was asked to form a government in such a way that one and the same performer may not receive more than one contract worth more than $ 1 billion rubles , or several contracts worth more than $ 1 billion . </seg>
<seg id="21">in минстрое believe that this approach must be assessed from the point of view of the business impact , and effectiveness of construction management . </seg>
<seg id="22">as explained by Elena Zhukova , in this case , it will endow customer functions , which will lead to an increase in the number of customer and budgetary expenditure on its content . </seg>
<seg id="23">at the same time , specialists customer will need to have the knowledge to assess the quality of its contractors , as well as their safety . </seg>
<seg id="24">often when such noncompliance will have to determine who will be responsible for the security of an object as a whole . </seg>
<seg id="25">in addition , this approach may lead to an outflow of qualified participants in the state in connection with the new leadership in obtaining public order for part-time work and a small amount of the contract . </seg>
<seg id="26">deputy экспертно-консультационного Center Institute of Procurement Alexander Евсташенков believes that right now , the government has turned to business to Scor contractor . </seg>
<seg id="27">and gave this example : &quot; a participant when completing the application must indicate the &quot; specific performance &quot; without specifying the words &quot; or equivalent &quot; , &quot; should &quot; , &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; more , &quot; &quot; less than , &quot; &quot; similar &quot; &quot; or &quot; , &quot; type &quot; , &quot; a similar type , &quot; &quot; lower , &quot; &quot; lower , &quot; &quot; higher , &quot; &quot; can , &quot; &quot; may , &quot; &quot; might , &quot; &quot; earlier &quot; and &quot; not previously , &quot; &quot; higher , &quot; &quot; not allowed &quot; and so on . </seg>
<seg id="28">thus , customers often abused their right to establish requirements for the content of applications of contractors . </seg>
<seg id="29">another problem 44-ФЗ , according to Евсташенкова , was the need to assess the application of quality of work through the &quot; paper &quot; proposal . </seg>
<seg id="30">considering the application , really can be assessed only a qualified contractor , but not the quality of the work , the implementation of which is not even began cooking , &quot; said the expert . </seg>
<seg id="31">the quality of the works can be assessed only on their acceptance . </seg>
<seg id="32">the expert council also was asked to take a margin income from the upper to the lower echelon to intermediate contractors . </seg>
<seg id="33">chairman of the Expert Council , State Secretary , espionage FAS Andrew Цариковский believes that it should not , as responsible for the order should генподрядчик . </seg>

<seg id="32">don is a good man . </seg>
<seg id="33">why would I not be friends with Don ? </seg>

<seg id="49">he learned on the job . </seg>
<seg id="50">I not only had to grow in the eyes of the public , I had to learn how to be an effective vehicle for delivering jokes between 1975 and 1985 , being a star , working on TV , and it was very hard . </seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny in the &apos; New faces &quot; in 1975 </seg>
<seg id="52">as his manager had the rights to the &quot; Black and white show minstrels , &quot; light entertainment program , in which people &quot; чернили themselves face , &quot; Henry found out what is in it for five years . </seg>
<seg id="53">my family is a very disliked . </seg>
<seg id="54">I was , like , I want to make sure this never happened to me , but I don &apos;t regret that did it . </seg>
<seg id="55">although it was strange , worthy of condemnation , I worked on large sites and was working with the crowd . </seg>

<seg id="59">commercials , documentaries , television series and roles in cinema took over the next ten years of his life , but after his show on the BBC in 2008 , &quot; LennyHenry.tv , &quot; he thought , &quot; what are you going to do next , Len , because some think you &apos;re тянешь time or quietly сворачиваешь aside . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="60">next was a series of documentary broadcasts on Radio 4 called &quot; What &apos;s good for ... ? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="61">the first was about Шекспире . </seg>
<seg id="62">I was allergic to Shakespeare . </seg>
<seg id="63">we cannot say to me adequately taught this at school , and I thought that it was , in many ways , the prerogative of white people , the middle class with колготками and cabbage downstairs in front . </seg>
<seg id="64">so I very much his fear . </seg>
<seg id="65">all of those we accepted interviews for transmission , Peter Hall , Trevor Nunn , Adrian Lester , Judy Денч said : &quot; you need to try . </seg>
<seg id="66">not ругай it as long as you don &apos;t know what you are talking about . </seg>
<seg id="67">произнеси aloud some of these words , and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare . </seg>
<seg id="68">Henry read about 20 rows from the last monologue Othello for the documentary , and his зацепило . </seg>
<seg id="69">I had the feeling that I can do it . </seg>
<seg id="70">it &apos;s like my head выправили . </seg>
<seg id="71">&quot; that &apos;s what it is , this is a serious case , Treat seriously , situated his text , conduct a study . </seg>
<seg id="72">so , the process of rehearsal was tough , and I read this play for months and months before we have set . </seg>
<seg id="73">and it was a success . </seg>
<seg id="74">it seemed that they were waiting for a disaster , but it has not happened . </seg>
<seg id="75">soon we began &quot; Комедию mistakes . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="76">suddenly I was at the National Theatre , and I just couldn &apos;t believe it until the end . </seg>
<seg id="77">there was one moment when I thought , &quot; Oh , you have changed . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="78">a technical problem , and Henry instinctively felt that his case - to entertain the audience . </seg>
<seg id="79">&quot; the Pacific voice inside me said : &apos; you have to work for 10 minutes , until they &apos;re operations computer . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="80">instead , the assistant director , announced that the representation will resume as soon as the problem will be solved . </seg>
<seg id="81">I walked away from the scene and something in me said , &quot; Oh , thank God . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="82">it &apos;s not my responsibility . </seg>
<seg id="83">I can &apos;t let someone else deal with it . </seg>
<seg id="84">&quot; you &apos;re playing in the play , stay in the role . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="85">Henry in &quot; заборах &quot; in theatre Дачесс </seg>
<seg id="86">learn the &quot; Заборов &quot; was difficult . </seg>
<seg id="87">panic is quite useful , she strengthens muscle . </seg>
<seg id="88">it also accepted the fine , so this was like a sign showing : &quot; here &apos;s what you need to do . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="89">he says it is , of course , Громовым voice . </seg>
<seg id="90">so I держусь this . </seg>
<seg id="91">I really love it . </seg>
<seg id="92">I love being in the репетиционном hall . </seg>
<seg id="93">by the way , Henry is still thinking comedian - all the way our conversation перебивают flashes of his humour when he then begins , then stops to parody . </seg>
<seg id="94">I just decided not to work in стендапе because this thing with the instant gratification of a full room of strangers , I think , quite dangerous . </seg>
<seg id="95">if you have all the time to try , it could lead to a standstill . </seg>
<seg id="96">I sometimes work in &quot; Прямом broadcast in Apollo , when I want , but , in the main , I don &apos;t get so much pleasure as before . </seg>
<seg id="97">I ask , would he give tour стендапа ever . </seg>
<seg id="98">the joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning , the middle and the end of the road - I don &apos;t think I ever wanted it to . </seg>

<seg id="21">for this day , Кеверн began playing the ideation piano and a rough comic voice praise great legs Эйлинн . </seg>
<seg id="22">Эйлинн not understood . </seg>
<seg id="23">&quot; this was a popular if jazz pianist named Фэтс Уоллер , &quot; he said , mechanically to his lips , two fingers . </seg>
<seg id="24">so did his father to stop the letter &quot; J &quot; before she слетит with his lips . </seg>
<seg id="25">it started with a game that they played when he was little . </seg>
<seg id="26">his father played in it with his father , as he told him . </seg>
<seg id="27">start with &quot; J &quot; , forgetting to attach to his mouth two fingers , &quot; and it will cost you , penny . </seg>
<seg id="28">it was not a very funny game then , and it was not very fun right now . </seg>
<seg id="29">he knew that from him , wait , that &apos;s all . </seg>
<seg id="30">he had to explain what is jazz . </seg>
<seg id="31">Эйлинн never heard . </seg>
<seg id="32">jazz is playing , even though he was not explicitly prohibited . </seg>
<seg id="33">improvisation went out of fashion . </seg>
<seg id="34">in life the only one &quot; if . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="35">when the music started , people wanted to know exactly where it will end . </seg>
<seg id="36">with wit in exactly the same way . </seg>
<seg id="37">his unpredictability had acted on the nerves . </seg>
<seg id="38">but jazz was wit , marked by music . </seg>
<seg id="39">although he has reached the age of 10 years , never слышав about Sammy Дэвисе Младшем , Кеверн knew about jazz from the paternal полусекретной коллеции CDs . </seg>
<seg id="40">but at least he did not have to speak Эйлинн that Фэтс Уоллер was black . </seg>
<seg id="41">given her age , could hardly she remembered a time when popular singers were not black . </seg>
<seg id="42">again , no laws or pressure . </seg>
<seg id="43">society was docile , and this meant that each segment agreed with gratitude - the gratitude of those spared destiny , &quot; with the principle of group predispositions . </seg>
<seg id="44">people афро-карибского origin in temperament and physical characteristics are well up for the areas of entertainment and sports , and they sang and ran . </seg>
<seg id="45">natives of Indian sub-continent , as if by nature talented in everything that concerned the electronics , the fact that no family is left without a working electronic phone . </seg>
<seg id="46">what is left of the Polish diaspora , delivered by сантехническими works ; what is left of the Greek , should plates . </seg>
<seg id="47">originating from the Persian Gulf and the bank , whose grandfathers were not quickly leave the country when DO THAT happened , IF ВООБЩЕ happened happened , for fear that they were accused of inciting the flames , in fear , in fact , that the flame will absorb their following , have opened restaurants with лабне and not people and yearned to leisure . </seg>
<seg id="48">each according to his abilities . </seg>
<seg id="49">as she had heard only ballads Эйлинн was difficult to understand how offensive words , who had just sung her Кеверн , could be set to music . </seg>
<seg id="50">music is an expression of love . </seg>
<seg id="51">&quot; they are not really offensive , &quot; said Кеверн . </seg>
<seg id="52">except , maybe , for people who have great legs . </seg>
<seg id="53">my father have never offended , but he loved this song . </seg>
<seg id="54">he said too much , but launched a garden gave him the illusion of security . </seg>
<seg id="55">no word could not penetrate the soundproofing giant leaves similar to or . . . . </seg>
<seg id="56">Эйлинн still did not understand . </seg>
<seg id="57">like your father could love this ? </seg>
<seg id="58">he wanted to say that this is a joke , but he never wanted to be with her again прижимать to his lips , two fingers . </seg>
<seg id="59">she already thought it strange . </seg>
<seg id="60">&quot; it was funny , &quot; he said instead . </seg>
<seg id="61">she incredulously shook her head , closed Кеверну review . </seg>
<seg id="62">the whole world was nothing but копны her иссиня-черных hair . </seg>
<seg id="63">nothing , that he would like to watch . </seg>
<seg id="64">&quot; well , if you say , &quot; she said , remaining in her opinion . </seg>
<seg id="65">but that still doesn &apos;t explain why you &apos;re me her sing . </seg>
<seg id="66">she seemed really upset . </seg>
<seg id="67">I have too big feet ? </seg>
<seg id="68">he looked at them again . </seg>
<seg id="69">you cannot say no . </seg>
<seg id="70">ankles , maybe a little bit . </seg>
<seg id="71">and you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick ? </seg>
<seg id="72">I hate you ? </seg>
<seg id="73">of course , I don &apos;t hate . </seg>
<seg id="74">it &apos;s just this stupid song . </seg>
<seg id="75">he could say : &quot; I love you , &quot; but it was too early . </seg>
<seg id="76">&quot; I like you very much because you have thick ankles &quot; , tried to say he instead . </seg>
<seg id="77">I have such a travesty . </seg>
<seg id="78">it was wrong . </seg>
<seg id="79">he wanted it to be funny . </seg>
<seg id="80">attempts by the joke often led him into awkward situation , because , like his father , he was missing the soothing charm that could mitigate the cruelty , крывшуюся in ? jokes . </seg>
<seg id="81">maybe his father wanted to be cruel . </seg>
<seg id="82">maybe he , Кеверн , wanted . </seg>
<seg id="83">despite the good eye . </seg>
<seg id="84">Эйлинн Соломонз she blushed and stood up with the push of опрокинув console and Strait wine that they drank . </seg>
<seg id="85">wine from to ensure that intoxication could not serve as his excuse . </seg>
<seg id="86">in his excitement , she seemed lighter as пальмовые leaves in a weather system . </seg>
<seg id="87">&quot; and you , I like you very much because you have a stupid head , &quot; she said . </seg>
<seg id="88">although not like you very much . </seg>
<seg id="89">he was feeling sorry for her because of the excessive brutality of his words , and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she gave him . </seg>
<seg id="90">she thought if she was that he hit ? </seg>
<seg id="91">she has not talked to him about life in the cold of the northern archipelago , where she grew up , but he had no doubt that , in a fundamental sense , she was similar to здешнюю . </seg>
<seg id="92">the same huge icy ocean struck on both of them . </seg>
<seg id="93">as the male , even more sensitive and capricious after that happened , IF ВООБЩЕ happened than their ancestors , smugglers and разрушители , shopped in fury from pub to pub , ready to raise a hand on any woman , посмевшую refuse them or upset them . </seg>
<seg id="94">stupid head ? </seg>
<seg id="95">they would have shown her a fist , if she was not cautious . </seg>
<seg id="96">first would be kissed , kiss now became the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman ; an antidote from fresh ballads , too , which provide proper console - the first kiss her , and then hit . </seg>
<seg id="97">excessive clarification , according to Кеверна because the kiss itself was already DVD films . </seg>
<seg id="98">Эйлинн Соломонз case showed that he needs to leave . </seg>
<seg id="99">he got up from the push , like an old man . </seg>
<seg id="100">she herself felt the lead weight , but the weight of his grief surprised her . </seg>
<seg id="101">this was not the end of the world . </seg>
<seg id="102">they barely knew each other . </seg>
<seg id="103">she looked , as he goes , and from the upper windows looked , as he leaves , her companion , the man himself взваливший on others . </seg>
<seg id="104">Adam , the outgoing garden , she thought . </seg>
<seg id="105">she felt a stab of sympathy towards him and men in general , even though some of them and raised her hand . </seg>
<seg id="106">a man , отвернувшийся from her , from the pulpit , пристыженный , knight , all ability to fight left him - why she felt she knew so well , if she could not recall a single case , until today , when she saw this ? </seg>
<seg id="107">again , one Эйлинн Соломонз looked at their feet . </seg>
<seg id="108">in the twenty years prior to the above events or so Эсме Нуссбаум , an intelligent and energetic 32-летняя исследовательница who worked in &quot; Офнау &quot; informal service control over Community mood , has prepared a report on the low and medium levels of violence in most parts of the country , where it was expected that it will be reduced , if not lifted entirely , given the money and power , which were allocated to its eradication . </seg>
<seg id="109">&quot; a lot was done , and a lot is being done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; in order to allay врожденную aggressiveness of people who fought in a war and won most of them , especially among these спутанных branches and narrow расселин terrain , where , despite the insulation over изгородями spires of churches , gentle breathing human kindness rarely has been felt in the history . </seg>
<seg id="110">however , some quality , it turns out , неискоренимы . </seg>
<seg id="111">the higher the spire , it would seem , the низменнее those passions that he зарождает . </seg>
<seg id="112">people shed tears over the sentimental skipping , drinking stories about преодоленных obstacles and announces its overheated belief in the virtue of marriage and family life , but not only the old rudeness retains its strong grip as in rural communities and in urban settlements , but there is evidence that , if the new and vile задиристость in homes , in the workplace , on roads and even in playgrounds . </seg>
<seg id="113">&quot; you have досадная habit of writing too much , &quot; said her supervisor , having read the report as a whole . </seg>
<seg id="114">it seems to me that you should read shorter novels . </seg>
<seg id="115">Эсме Нуссбаум lowered her head . </seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask you : you атеистка ? </seg>
<seg id="117">&quot; I think that is not obliged to answer , &quot; replied Эсме Нуссбаум . </seg>
<seg id="118">you lesbian ? </seg>
<seg id="119">Эсме again insisted on his right to privacy and silence . </seg>
<seg id="120">a feminist ? </seg>
<seg id="121">again , silence . </seg>
<seg id="122">&quot; I ask , &quot; finally said Luther Рабиновиц , &quot; not because I am against atheism , лесбийства or feminism . </seg>
<seg id="123">there is no prejudice . </seg>
<seg id="124">we are the servants of society without prejudice . </seg>
<seg id="125">but some kinds of hypersensitivity , absolutely reasonable and a good in themselves , they may sometimes distort the results , such as , for example , those that you showed me . </seg>
<seg id="126">it is obvious that you yourself предубеждены against the church , and what you call &quot; malevolent &quot; and &quot; rude &quot; , others would be interpreted as an expression of natural healthy and intensity . </seg>
<seg id="127">continue нудеть about IN THAT happened , IF ВООБЩЕ happened , as if it happened , if it happened yesterday , it means depriving the country needed her life force . </seg>
<seg id="128">Эсме Нуссбаум огляделась laterally until Рабиновиц said . </seg>
<seg id="129">over his head , pink , as well as equipment , led the letter repeated advice that &quot; Офнау &quot; gave the country the last quarter of a century or more . </seg>
<seg id="130">улыбайся with his neighbour , the value of his wife , hear the ballads , go to organise , talk on the phone , communicate , fairytale city , listen , соглашайся , извиняйся . </seg>
<seg id="131">the conversation is better than silence , word of the song better than the written word , but there is nothing better than love . </seg>
<seg id="132">&quot; I fully understand that you want to say , &quot; quietly replied Эсме Нуссбаум , when satisfied that her supervisor had finished talking , &quot; and I don &apos;t want to say anything , except that we don &apos;t he so effectively as we convince ourselves . </seg>
<seg id="133">I am worried about is that if we do not we are ready , we will find that repeat mistakes that initially led to ТОМУ THAT happened , IF ВООБЩЕ happened . </seg>
<seg id="134">only this time we выбросим their anger and distrust , not on others . </seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Рабиновиц joined the tips of fingers in a sitting . </seg>
<seg id="136">that gesture was supposed to mean an infinite patience . </seg>
<seg id="137">&quot; you go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; calling &quot; mistakes &quot; actions that made or not made our grandfathers . </seg>
<seg id="138">you go too far and when talking about what they threw away their &quot; anger &quot; and &quot; mistrust &quot; in the &quot; other . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="139">in your place , people should not need always to remind that understanding the past , that is , in the present , we are not talking about &quot; us &quot; and &quot; them . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="140">there was no &quot; us &quot; and no &quot; other . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="141">it was the time of the disorder - and that &apos;s all that we know . </seg>
<seg id="142">&quot; for which , to be honest with ourselves , &quot; ventured to insert Эсме , &quot; neither part of society may well justify themselves . </seg>
<seg id="143">I do not accuse . </seg>
<seg id="144">whether it &apos;s bad or good , what is done is done . </seg>
<seg id="145">then it was back then . </seg>
<seg id="146">nothing to say - and here we agree . </seg>
<seg id="147">and how does not need anyone to blame , don &apos;t need and making excuses , if that was appropriate , or if it was something to fix . </seg>
<seg id="148">but why , if not to learn &quot; </seg>
<seg id="149">past Update to ensure that we have forgotten . </seg>
<seg id="150">if I can add to that one word - </seg>
<seg id="151">Great Pyramid Luther Рабиновица collapsed . </seg>
<seg id="152">&quot; I &apos;ll review your report , &quot; he said , and dismissed her . </seg>
<seg id="153">the next day , on the way to work , she knocked off a biker who rode on the sidewalk , as described passers-by , &quot; in a vicious rage . &quot; </seg>

<seg id="8">there is speculation that the ECB ’ s Mario Draghi later this week may give further signals that he is contemplating scheme of quantitative easing in the eurozone , similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis . </seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips , how to achieve a better quality of underwater photos and videos </seg>
<seg id="2">if you want to take pictures or shoot video under water before you a range of options . </seg>
<seg id="3">the cheapest option is a waterproof &quot; Point and Shoot , &quot; for example , the Nikon Coolpix AW120 , or экшн-камера , for example , the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition , both of which sold for about $ 300 . </seg>
<seg id="4">I took these pictures on a family holiday with the help of several cameras , all for the price of about $ 350 . </seg>
<seg id="5">no matter what equipment you use , the more rules you need to abide by in order to achieve the best results . </seg>
<seg id="6">перепроверяйте their equipment . </seg>
<seg id="7">even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure case cameras and other tightly closed . </seg>
<seg id="8">in addition , set up their camera for the type of photos or videos that you shoot . </seg>
<seg id="9">some photo and video cameras have regimes shooting or object type , which optimise exposure for затемненных underwater conditions . </seg>
<seg id="10">and before you jump in the water , notice how deeply your equipment can fall . </seg>
<seg id="11">some cameras are only 5 feet , others - 50 or 60 feet . </seg>
<seg id="12">look at our leadership and the ratings of digital cameras for both traditional and водонепроницаемых models . </seg>
<seg id="13">remove a few frames - because many of them never get . </seg>
<seg id="14">the &quot; point &quot; is the LCD , which lets you assign images , whereas the экшн-камер them usually don &apos;t . </seg>
<seg id="15">even if you have LCD , it will be difficult to see under the water , and the frame is a random process . </seg>
<seg id="16">so do a few frames . </seg>
<seg id="17">also , if your camera has the serial shooting , which takes several shots with slightly different installations that use them . </seg>
<seg id="18">stay at the surface . </seg>
<seg id="19">the amount of light is significantly reduced , the deeper you нырнете under water . </seg>
<seg id="20">if possible , stay at the surface , when you &apos;re shooting in a swimming pool , a river or ocean . </seg>
<seg id="21">it also allows you to transmit more colors in the photos ; the deeper you go far less color you see . </seg>
<seg id="22">подплывайте closer to shooting . </seg>
<seg id="23">this is excellent advice for shooting on the land , but it is even more important under the water because затемненных lighting conditions . </seg>
<seg id="24">it is especially important if you &apos;re shooting on экшн-камеру : this equipment often comes with a fixed , широкоугольной lens , which means that you have to get closer to the object of filming , if you want to fill the frame . </seg>

<seg id="12">he asked a colleague to do X-rays chest . </seg>
<seg id="13">just two weeks before he went skiing in the first . </seg>
<seg id="14">results of the X-rays came . </seg>
<seg id="15">it was mesothelioma , a terminal cancer , which affects плевру , or lungs . </seg>
<seg id="16">for most cancers it is difficult to determine an exact cause . </seg>
<seg id="17">although some people became ill with cancer of the lung , for example , not all patients with cancer of the lungs of smoking . </seg>
<seg id="18">but with attributable to mesothelioma differently . </seg>
<seg id="19">in almost all cases , the cause is contact with asbestos , grainy construction material , who once called the &quot; miracle , &quot; but which , as we now know , deadly dangerous . </seg>
<seg id="20">for most of us mesothelioma is a disease that you don &apos;t pay attention . </seg>
<seg id="21">asbestos , in the end , is the stuff from the past . </seg>
<seg id="22">the most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in the UK since the 1960s , when these industrial ban came into force . </seg>
<seg id="23">even when it has been used , only people from specific sectors worked in close contact with him : трубоизолировщики , builders , carpenters and docks , for example . </seg>
<seg id="24">industrial toxin from another era , he is hardly seen as a cause for concern today . </seg>
<seg id="25">but such a calm erroneously . </seg>
<seg id="26">Britain , it turns out , is now at the peak of the epidemic мезотелиомы . </seg>
<seg id="27">here , from мезотелиомы kills more people than any other country on the planet . </seg>
<seg id="28">in the annual mortality rate in about 2500 people , more than twice as many people die from the disease than as a result of road accidents . </seg>
<seg id="29">the annual number of deaths from мезотелиомы since 1980 and projected the number of deaths in the future in the UK </seg>
<seg id="30">the reason we feel its deadly consequences right now , lies in the fact that , although the use of asbestos it is illegal for many years ( all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999 ) , for the development of мезотелиомы go usually tens of years . </seg>
<seg id="31">and attack мезотелиомы is not limited to veterans specialties industrial construction . </seg>
<seg id="32">asbestos was and , in many cases , remains in the house where we live , where we work , schools , where we learn , and shops , where we go shopping . </seg>
<seg id="33">as a result , mesothelioma does not pay attention in class , the level of affluence , profession or age . </seg>
<seg id="34">bastions of избранности , from the fashionable London department stores to private schools , as it turned out , not salvation . </seg>
<seg id="35">the parliamentary building is riddled with asbestos . </seg>
<seg id="36">even hospitals that are designed to treat us , turned out to be reservoirs of this deadly a carcinogen . </seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old . </seg>
<seg id="38">he was not трубоизолировщиком . </seg>
<seg id="39">strictly speaking , he had to think where he might have come into contact with asbestos . </seg>
<seg id="40">then he realized . </seg>
<seg id="41">&quot; it seems that there could be a lot of asbestos in tunnels in the hospital , where I spent six years on it , &quot; he wrote . </seg>
<seg id="42">all are students , nurses , doctors and грузчики - used these тоннелями . </seg>
<seg id="43">I wonder how many of my peers expect the same disease ? </seg>
<seg id="44">it was a question to which , unfortunately , he could give a partial response . </seg>
<seg id="45">&quot; from four doctors , which we in the hospital , Guy and which have subsequently developed mesothelioma for the past five years , &quot; he said in a letter in 2010 , &quot; I alone remained alive . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="46">how many of us expect this disease ? </seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Лоусону was diagnosed with &quot; mesothelioma , &quot; when he was 48 years old . </seg>
<seg id="48">when he died on February 17 this year , he was 55 . </seg>
<seg id="49">to live so long . </seg>
<seg id="50">fifty percent of cases attributable to mesothelioma died within eight months after diagnosis . </seg>
<seg id="51">it is always fatal . </seg>
<seg id="52">so , now , we can only repeat the question Лоусона : &quot; how many of us expect this disease ? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="53">according to a leading expert on мезотелиоме in Britain , Professor Джулиану Пито , most likely assume that between 1970 and 2050 , when the asbestos epidemic in Britain should be an himself , die about a wealthy man . </seg>
<seg id="54">most now are not that die that way . </seg>
<seg id="55">asbestos mine in Quebec , Canada , Alamy </seg>
<seg id="56">a quick review of reports from the halls of the court , where victims are often seek compensation , shows how far it has spread attack мезотелиомы . </seg>
<seg id="57">in June , for example , Marks &amp; Spencer acknowledged that the recent Джэнис Ellen contact with asbestos . </seg>
<seg id="58">she worked for nine years , from 1978 to 1987 , departments of clothing on two sites , one of which was the main store on Oxford Street . </seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs Ellen was just 18 years old , when she started working at M &amp; S. </seg>
<seg id="60">now her two children are older than 20 years old . </seg>
<seg id="61">&quot; before this happened , &quot; she says , &quot; I had never heard about мезотелиоме , I barely knew about Асбесте . </seg>
<seg id="62">me in the head and could not come to that , I was hurt . </seg>
<seg id="63">few people are really a lot of people know about Асбесте . </seg>
<seg id="64">in fact , asbestos is not one substance , and a group of six minerals . </seg>
<seg id="65">they get their name from the word &quot; асбестиформ &quot; , which means the fibrous structure , which tells them the strength and flexibility . </seg>
<seg id="66">of those six , three are often used in the construction . </seg>
<seg id="67">chrysotile , widely known as white asbestos , is much more common in buildings today . </seg>
<seg id="68">it has been used in roofing panels , an outdoor stove , thermal insulation pipes , boiler rooms and toilets , even in a hundred cars . </seg>
<seg id="69">he less смертелен than other forms of asbestos , but still recognised by the European Union and the World Health Organization &quot; major source of harm health , &quot; which can lead to death . </seg>
<seg id="70">more dangerous , however , brown asbestos ( амозит ) and blue asbestos ( крокидолит ) . </seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world &apos;s largest importer of brown asbestos in the world , and experts have speculated that &quot; there are good , though indirect reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of cases attributable to mesothelioma &#91; in the UK &#93; . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="72">at Marks &amp; Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the main store on Oxford Street , London , Alamy </seg>
<seg id="73">Джэнис Ellen may not have thought of himself as a typical victim мезотелиомы , but work Julian Пито suggests that her story is not unusual . </seg>
<seg id="74">he conducted a study of patients , which suggests that a significant percentage of мезотелиом when there is no known exposure at work or at home , were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="75">much of this impact , he says , is &quot; normal use and exposure to weather &quot; in our building . </seg>
<seg id="76">no one , it seems , can &apos;t be sure that he is safe . </seg>
<seg id="77">the report Goddard Consulting , which addressed Westminster Palace , demonstrates how people , even in the heart of the Government could be exposed to unconsciously . </seg>
<seg id="78">in 2009 , Goddard said that technical mines and pipelines for the premises of parliamentary committees were infected with asbestos , lethal fibres which may have given the movement of something as harmless as &quot; strong currents of air . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="79">members of the parliament often blame the fact that they are pursuing their own interests , but in this case , it seems , that is true . </seg>
<seg id="80">although the Agency for maintenance of Parliament insisted that Westminster Palace received a &quot; clean bill of health , &quot; and now she recognized that it is necessary to work on the £ 1 billion for the reconstruction of the Parliament , by upgrading electrician and removing asbestos , and that after the general election of 2015 , members of Parliament , perhaps , will meet in the conference centre and their fertility rates collapse near , but not on the green benches was . </seg>
<seg id="81">the report Goddard said , noting that &quot; the situation with asbestos is not Poland , in accordance with the various rules . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="82">it is impossible to know whether this error management cost lives . </seg>
<seg id="83">all we can do now is wait . </seg>
<seg id="84">one of those who have not managed to identify his contact with asbestos , is Graham cost , a common practice . </seg>
<seg id="85">as Andrew Lawson , the cost of 50 years , suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals . </seg>
<seg id="86">&quot; I worked at the hospital , which has successfully brought claims associated with asbestos , &quot; he says , &quot; But I can &apos;t prove this in my case . </seg>
<seg id="87">it &apos;s so hard to remember all the places where I worked , and dates . </seg>
<seg id="88">he remembers clearly , so this day in early December 2009 , when his wholly overcame something that was like the flu . </seg>
<seg id="89">he was 45 , and he was in the middle of the operation later in the evening . </seg>
<seg id="90">suddenly I were shaken as . </seg>
<seg id="91">it started very quickly . </seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terrible . </seg>
<seg id="93">I thought I can &apos;t drive all the way to homes . </seg>
<seg id="94">as a doctor , cost knew that pain comes from including checking for iframe loads , the membranes surrounding the lungs . </seg>
<seg id="95">however , like Джэнис Ellen , he simply had no reason to suspect мезотелиому . </seg>
<seg id="96">ultimately , he couldn &apos;t walk for a month . </seg>
<seg id="97">US doctors made X-ray images chest and put плевральные катетеры to pull fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis . </seg>
<seg id="98">and yet his condition оставлось without a diagnosis . </seg>
<seg id="99">gradually , his health has improved , and he returned to work . </seg>
<seg id="100">but from time to time , those same symptoms return , often after he engaged in sports , and he breathed heavily . </seg>
<seg id="101">in 2011 , one of the patients Эбботта came to him in office with similar symptoms , and he was later diagnosed with &quot; mesothelioma . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="102">but even then , the cost of not linked it with its own case . </seg>
<seg id="103">in the end , his patient was ten years older and had worked with asbestos . </seg>
<seg id="104">in this case , was obvious . </seg>
<seg id="105">in September 2011 the Эбботта deteriorated again , and консультировавший his doctor revealed the results of the CT and X-ray images of a group of experts . </seg>
<seg id="106">in December 2011 , just two years later , after the cost of began to feel ill , sensor , equipped with a camera , was introduced in the cavity between the shell of his chest and the shell of his lung . </seg>
<seg id="107">I &apos;m an optimist . </seg>
<seg id="108">I usually just go further , &quot; he said . </seg>
<seg id="109">I &apos;m not too upset about it , to be honest . </seg>
<seg id="110">but Rachel , my wife was . </seg>
<seg id="111">the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year : &quot; they told me that this is mesothelioma . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="112">Graham cost : diagnosis mesothelioma </seg>
<seg id="113">suddenly cost sank during a meeting with nurses Macmillan , one of which suggested he contact a lawyer . </seg>
<seg id="114">it was then he realised the scale of the epidemic . </seg>
<seg id="115">&quot; as it turns out , asbestos is widely used , especially in large public buildings , and where quite often there was asbestos once on the planet , &quot; he says . </seg>
<seg id="116">people who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings , now get sick with this disease . </seg>
<seg id="117">thus , mesothelioma now affects more young people нетипичных professions . </seg>
<seg id="118">the most dangerous isolated asbestos pipes in hospitals were in basements , so it is unlikely that affected patients . </seg>
<seg id="119">but many employees , who were the tunnels connecting nearby landmasses can bring together to get from one building to another ( as Andrew Lawson ) , or ate in the basements of canteens ( how often did Graham cost ) almost certainly really were exposed to toxic substances . </seg>
<seg id="120">for several decades after the war , as it turns out , the hospital was a place where , in theory , pulled the life for поциентов , but of a place , which constituted a threat to life for doctors who treated . </seg>
<seg id="121">it still continues to remove today . </seg>
<seg id="122">students set their burners Бунзена on asbestos cradle </seg>
<seg id="123">and it &apos;s not just hospitals . </seg>
<seg id="124">asbestos was often used in offices , shops , libraries and мэриях because of his amazing insulating and if characteristics . </seg>
<seg id="125">schools too . </seg>
<seg id="126">strictly speaking , most likely , the first time they were exposed to asbestos in the classroom . </seg>
<seg id="127">nationwide , on countless lessons chemistry students set their burners Бунзена on asbestos cradle . </seg>
<seg id="128">there websites highlighting the problem of asbestos in schools . </seg>
<seg id="129">meanwhile , in our homes , such harmless things as floor tiles or roof сараев typically contained asbestos . </seg>
<seg id="130">&quot; this is an industrial poison , in a huge number of our buildings , &quot; notes Andrew Morgan , a lawyer who represented Andrew Лоусона in a case against the hospital , Guy . </seg>
<seg id="131">in one case , the only contact , about which he could remember the woman who was the demolition of garden shed in the 1970s . </seg>
<seg id="132">so be careful , снося garden sheds . </seg>
<seg id="133">the effect of the diagnosis , when we know that the disease is incurable , is huge . </seg>
<seg id="134">&quot; to realize it , is quite a lot of time , &quot; says Graham cost . </seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to continue , but I realised that I couldn &apos;t focus on what I &apos;m doing . </seg>
<seg id="136">I stayed in the surgery for two weeks . </seg>
<seg id="137">then I realized that I had to go and deal with them . </seg>
<seg id="138">well , I don &apos;t meet Christmas </seg>
<seg id="139">one of the most difficult things was the transition from doctor to patient . </seg>
<seg id="140">as countless patients before him , he remembers , was downed with a confusing amount of information that had to be taken . </seg>
<seg id="141">&quot; it was difficult to understand , &quot; he says . </seg>
<seg id="142">&quot; I asked my doctor , &quot; How much do I have time ? &quot; </seg>
<seg id="143">gave me about 12 months . </seg>
<seg id="144">I remember , as I thought , &quot; Well , I didn &apos;t meet Christmas . </seg>
<seg id="145">that &apos;s all . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="146">mesothelioma is particularly dangerous , as it is the mechanics of how we are in life , is the act of breathing -- causes cancer , which kills . </seg>
<seg id="147">the majority of cases мезотелиомы caused by contact with asbestos . </seg>
<seg id="148">asbestos is composed of tiny fibers . </seg>
<seg id="149">when asbestos is being destroyed and fiber carcinogenic , they could get stuck in плевре , shell . </seg>
<seg id="150">fibers of asbestos irritating плевру and can cause mutations . </seg>
<seg id="151">&quot; the problem occurs because of breathing the matrix of fibers of asbestos , &quot; Professor Tom Трежер , кардиоторакальный surgeon , who came in 2001 in hospital Guy . </seg>
<seg id="152">it is the hospital , where , as suspected , Andrew Lawson , he was exposed to asbestos , now , ironically , a leading center in the treatment of мезотелиомы . </seg>
<seg id="153">Трежер knew Лоусона and treated some of the others who , perhaps , was exposed to while in the hospital . </seg>
<seg id="154">when Sally Goodin Sally goodun Etc asbestos into the fabric of the lungs , &quot; says Трежер , &quot; breathing them unload on the periphery , where the shell . </seg>
<seg id="155">this is , essentially , an invasive process from the outset . </seg>
<seg id="156">conventional treatments for other forms of cancer is much less effective at мезотелиоме . </seg>
<seg id="157">the effectiveness of surgical intervention , for example , cause hot debate . </seg>
<seg id="158">some think that it is worth the try . </seg>
<seg id="159">Трежер disagrees . </seg>
<seg id="160">&quot; you can &apos;t cut плевру , &quot; he says . </seg>
<seg id="161">it around her region with a knife . </seg>
<seg id="162">meanwhile , the cancer is &quot; not very amenable to chemotherapy , &quot; which &quot; acts &quot; , but not people . </seg>
<seg id="163">&quot; from time to time there are patients who live a long time , &quot; says Трежер . </seg>
<seg id="164">but ultimately , they all die . </seg>
<seg id="165">fortunately , some patients are living much , much longer than expected . </seg>
<seg id="166">writer Stephen Jay Gould who died 20 years after he was diagnosed . </seg>
<seg id="167">two and a half years after diagnosis , Graham cost continues to fight . </seg>
<seg id="168">after he became ill attributable to mesothelioma , Эбботта acquainted with Andrew Лоусоном , which , four years after diagnosis , single-handedly turned into a desk support and consultation for these same patients . </seg>
<seg id="169">&quot; yes , Раковая Central , &quot; cheerfully told it , when they rang . </seg>
<seg id="170">&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says the cost . </seg>
<seg id="171">he was diagnosed four years ago , and he still is very energetic . </seg>
<seg id="172">first Эбботту offered six cycles of chemotherapy , which would take four months and prolonged his life only a month . </seg>
<seg id="173">&quot; I was in despair , &quot; he says . </seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up . </seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson , however , managed to give the somewhat more positive agenda . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="176">meeting with several specialists , cost decided to continue treatment with Professor Лоиком Ланж-Лаздунски , professor institutes in hospital Guy . </seg>
<seg id="177">&quot; we had an advantage in that I don &apos;t need it , I just called them and they took me , &quot; admits Graham . </seg>
<seg id="178">likely the patient would have to get the direction and approval for funding . </seg>
<seg id="179">money plays a pivotal role for patients with attributable to mesothelioma , in order to get the best available treatments . </seg>
<seg id="180">but when this treatment and finally , inevitably turn out to be ineffective for many patients face another financial reason for concern &quot; about the future of the families that they would leave . </seg>
<seg id="181">and then they ask the courts for compensation . </seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Price Waterhouse LLP . </seg>
<seg id="183">&quot; it has been known that asbestos is harmful to human health , since 1898 , &quot; said Morgan . </seg>
<seg id="184">but that changed in the 1960s , it became clear that even very small amounts can put their health at risk . </seg>
<seg id="185">it was then spoke about the bad faith of companies . </seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and hospital Guy ultimately resolve it , but it was not a &quot; settlement at full price , &quot; according to Morgan , as Lawson could not clearly prove that his mesothelioma was a result of exposure to asbestos at Guy . </seg>
<seg id="187">after the investigation into his death , a spokesman for the hospital , Guy is confirmed , however , that &quot; the asbestos in the basement , mentioned above , was removed in the 1990s . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="188">it was too late for Andrew Лоусона . </seg>
<seg id="189">how to remove asbestos </seg>
<seg id="190">in fact , tie deadly contact with asbestos to one company or place of work - usually through dozens of years after that - has proved to be a big problem for patients with attributable to mesothelioma , demanding compensation . </seg>
<seg id="191">many of their former employers have the owner or shut down . </seg>
<seg id="192">insurance archives could be lost . </seg>
<seg id="193">and those who are protected from lawsuits , know that in their time , which the plaintiffs , of course , is no . </seg>
<seg id="194">in response , this year took serious new legislative acts which facilitate patients with attributable to mesothelioma process to recover compensation , even if their former employers are impossible to trace . </seg>
<seg id="195">in accordance with the law , was created by £ 350-миллионный fund of funds , which is financed by the insurance industry for those who had been diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove the contact , but who is not expected to sue . </seg>
<seg id="196">in such cases , patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in a case about the compensation of about £ pirates . </seg>
<seg id="197">about 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected each year . </seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan , like many who work with patients with attributable to mesothelioma , believes that the £ 350 million represent a &quot; very good job &quot; for the industry . </seg>
<seg id="199">&quot; this transaction , written by companies for insurers , &quot; he says , hinting that the sum is a quarter of that , insurers would have to pay , if not intervened time and sick with attributable to mesothelioma could track the company and file a lawsuit in the usual way . </seg>
<seg id="200">even Mike Пеннинг , previously minister for work and pensions , acknowledged that the law is imperfect . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="201">but Пеннинг , and Morgan acknowledged that , in view of the fact that seven people dying every day , rapid action was needed . </seg>
<seg id="202">&quot; people suffer so much , and they need help now , &quot; said Пеннинг during the second reading of the Bill about мезотелиоме in December last year . </seg>
<seg id="203">by the time Graham cost was in the hands of Professor Лоика Ланж-Лаздунски 19 months . </seg>
<seg id="204">after the initial consultation Ланж-Лаздунски recommended surgery , which , unlike Tom Трежера , he believes to be effective . </seg>
<seg id="205">this was followed by radiation for and chemotherapy - тритерапия in which Ланж-Лаздунски boasts pristine 40 percent surviving patients for five years . </seg>
<seg id="206">the cost felt a surge of strength . </seg>
<seg id="207">&quot; this is , of course , is one of the most important things , &quot; says the cost . </seg>
<seg id="208">you see these patients all the time . </seg>
<seg id="209">there is a force that supports you . </seg>
<seg id="210">when сдаешься , the condition can deteriorate very quickly . </seg>
<seg id="211">Graham cost went to the surgery in March 2012 . </seg>
<seg id="212">by the end of August he finished last of six cycles of chemotherapy . </seg>
<seg id="213">subsequent scans showed no trace of the disease . </seg>
<seg id="214">then I had a scan in March &#91; 2014 &#93; . </seg>
<seg id="215">there were a few spots &#91; cancer &#93; in my chest . </seg>
<seg id="216">I just would not happen . </seg>
<seg id="217">this is not a threat to life . </seg>
<seg id="218">this is the end of life . </seg>
<seg id="219">and again , the cost went through six cycles of chemotherapy . </seg>
<seg id="220">now there is no trace of cancer . </seg>
<seg id="221">however , this process is both physically and emotionally heavy . </seg>
<seg id="222">you can think about practical things - about finances , and when I die , for example , or that we need to show his wife how timer on a big PRB . </seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders , protesters promise revenge </seg>
<seg id="2">the parliament of China decided Sunday to not allow voters in Hong Kong to nominate candidates for elections in 2017 , despite growing demands for democratic reforms . </seg>
<seg id="3">such a move would likely mark the beginning of long promised protests in Hong Kong as activists have begun planning and mobilization in a matter of hours after that statement . </seg>
<seg id="4">decision of the 11th National People &apos;s Congress , in fact , communist leaders to remove all the candidates who are loyal to Beijing . </seg>
<seg id="5">&quot; it &apos;s not обмануло our expectations , but still leads in rage , &quot; said legislator Emily Lau , chairman of the Democratic Party . </seg>
<seg id="6">this is not something that Beijing has promised . </seg>
<seg id="7">they lied to people in Hong Kong . </seg>
<seg id="8">and it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime . </seg>
<seg id="9">defending decision of China , Li Fey , Deputy General Secretary of the Standing Committee of the 11th National People &apos;s Congress , said that to allow the public to nominate for the election of Hong Kong would be too &quot; leopard skin &quot; . </seg>
<seg id="10">since 1997 , when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China , Beijing promised to allow residents of the region to choose by voting the head of government , starting in 2017 . </seg>
<seg id="11">Chinese leaders have presented the Sunday decision as a democratic step forward , since it gives гонконгцам right to direct the vote ; however , the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process in their own hands with the assistance of the Commission on the appointment of candidates , rigidly controlled from Beijing . </seg>
<seg id="12">and , according to a new article that only candidates who &quot; love the country and love Hong Kong &quot; will be allowed . </seg>
<seg id="13">the decision was taken after the summer , when there have been some of the most extensive and received widespread publicity the protests in Hong Kong for many years . </seg>
<seg id="14">for a large part of after a campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace , which threatened to cut off the financial district in Hong Kong if Beijing does not guarantee true universal suffrage . </seg>
<seg id="15">on Sunday evening , a few hours after the announcement , hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central gathered in the rain in front of the headquarters of the government of Hong Kong . </seg>
<seg id="16">the demonstration , which organisers claimed that their movement is shifting to a new phase of civil disobedience and that they rise up on the waves of protest in the next few weeks . </seg>
<seg id="17">nevertheless , they have not reported the details , obviously , to avoid problems with government authorities . </seg>
<seg id="18">in онлайн-заявлении organizers reported that movement &quot; обдумывало opportunity to capture the central region only as exceptional measures , actions that may be taken only if all the possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice . </seg>
<seg id="19">we regret to inform you that today , all possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the seizure of the central district , no doubt . </seg>
<seg id="20">authorities in Hong Kong were preparing to Beijing a few days , and on Sunday at the headquarters of the government had strengthened security measures involving police and barricades . </seg>
<seg id="21">the unrest is the feeling of many in Hong Kong , that they are slowly losing control over their city . </seg>
<seg id="22">the influx of residents from mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services . </seg>
<seg id="23">also intensifies the fear that values , such as democracy and freedom of speech , and begin to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing . </seg>
<seg id="24">some have criticized the movement Occupy Central , saying that his demonstration to jeopardize the businesses - the lifeblood of Hong Kong . </seg>
<seg id="25">&quot; the protest , which they say , it could cause great economic damage , depending on how many people will participate , and for how long , &quot; said lawmaker Regina Yip , who has long been critical of the movement . </seg>
<seg id="26">we do not want to spread concern about the fact that Hong Kong is out of control . </seg>
<seg id="27">this idea , which is harmful for investment . </seg>
<seg id="28">Chinese state media also gave reports in recent days , in which Hong Kong activists of the democratic movement were shown диверсантами considering Western powers . </seg>
<seg id="29">this summer , activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral law , which drew 7th participants - more than one-fifth of voters in Hong Kong . </seg>
<seg id="30">in July tens of thousands came out to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region . </seg>

<seg id="1">feminists are raising questions of racial identity and behavior of the police after Ferguson </seg>
<seg id="2">unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Фергюсоне , Missouri , earlier this month . </seg>
<seg id="3">coming are raising their hands , chanting : &quot; hands up , don &apos;t стреляй &quot; while they wait in line in front of Mr. . . . . </seg>
<seg id="4">after two weeks of protests in Фергюсоне , Missouri , killing 45 teenager Michael Brown , blogger Miriam зоила Perez noticed the shift in интернет-разговоре among white feminists . </seg>
<seg id="5">in her experience , the white feminists stamps comments put gender above race , when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality . </seg>
<seg id="6">however , as was growing tension in the Midwest and attracted nationwide attention , Peres saw responses of white women who focused 100 percent on the race . </seg>
<seg id="7">compared with the reaction of black women shortly after the killing on 9 August , personal essays with such titles as &quot; thoughts about Фергюсоне from white women &quot; and &quot; Феминизм is not only about угнетении women &quot; came relatively late . </seg>
<seg id="8">but for Perez , they demonstrated a significant shift . </seg>
<seg id="9">&quot; in feminism , I don &apos;t think there are many people who are talking about the white color of the skin and privileges at such a high level , &quot; she said . </seg>
<seg id="10">people felt the need to say something about what has happened . </seg>
<seg id="11">it &apos;s very symbolic for the crisis with which we are faced , and because of the situation in the Фергюсоне ) is so tied to race , they feel that it is necessary to specify . </seg>
<seg id="12">for a professor of English at the University of Ohio Кориты Mitchell Ferguson has laid bare problems with whom blacks one faced every day , but which are not perceived as &quot; women &apos;s issues &quot; in the cultural sphere . </seg>
<seg id="13">&quot; I can write something funny on Facebook about what &apos;s going on with me and my partner and get 150 лайков everywhere , &quot; says Mitchell . </seg>
<seg id="14">when I write something about how the colored people are attacked in his own country , silence Duper . </seg>
<seg id="15">&quot; why are women so publicly talk about relationships , but not about the security in the public sector ? &quot; she asks . </seg>
<seg id="16">for black women , like Mitchell , who studied the issues of race , gender and sexuality in the history of the United States , there is no dichotomy between matters relating to race and gender . </seg>
<seg id="17">from her point of view , blacks , women are in a position to clearly separate these problems ; they are faced with a complex reality every day . </seg>
<seg id="18">while white women now bring together issues of race and gender in feminist мейнстриме , Энджела Хэттери , professor of women &apos;s and gender studies at the University of George Mason , said that its predecessor did the opposite . </seg>
<seg id="19">&quot; between 1865 and 1890 years линчевали , at least 10,000 black men , and the reason that is almost always served as the rape of white women , &quot; said Хэттери . </seg>
<seg id="20">need a white woman , was the story to justify Nepal . </seg>
<seg id="21">from the point of view of Хэттери , the gap between white and black women occurred when white суфражистки , for instance , Susan B. Anthony looked at the situation in the late 1800s , and saw that the fight for suffrage will be effective only for one of the groups : women or blacks . </seg>
<seg id="22">&quot; they decided to lay eggs in the basket of voting rights for women , and the right to vote for blacks would appear later , &quot; said Хэттери . </seg>
<seg id="23">looking back on things like this gives us a clear idea of why colored women don &apos;t trust white women . </seg>
<seg id="24">we have not done anything good . </seg>
<seg id="25">we &apos;ve never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons . </seg>
<seg id="26">even after women won the right to vote in 1920 , it took ten years to ensure that the white women united against mob lynchings of the women of the South for the prevention of mob lynchings . </seg>
<seg id="27">this group emerged after almost 40 years after blacks , women first requested assistance , &quot; said Mitchell . </seg>
<seg id="28">from the point of view of Mitchell , and the reactions of white feminists on the issues raised in Фергюсоне , the conduct of the police , racial discrimination - reflects a time when white a feminist had to &quot; catch up &quot; with blacks , women cope in several generations . </seg>
<seg id="29">&quot; however , it would be fine , if female , which have such a &#91; traditional феминистическая &#93; ideology , so seriously would be to raise a child , how they relate to the right to contraception ? &quot; asked Mitchell . </seg>
<seg id="30">feminists in the second wave , who had made his career in the fight for reproductive rights and access to контрацептивам , now starting to understand what it means . </seg>
<seg id="31">known white activist феминистического movement Gloria Стайнем through two weeks after the killing of Michael Brown took Фейсбуком and published a sharp article колумнистки Guardian Rebecca Carroll , who claimed that white Americans took more participation in protests on issues of racism . </seg>
<seg id="32">&quot; I hope that women who have a different , but similar reason to understand the danger , repeated in the body , and a point of view on the racial issues that differ substantially from the general public - will be at the head of the change , &quot; wrote Стайнем . </seg>
<seg id="33">although Стайнем undertakes more пересекающийся feminism that involves issues of race and gender , her comments about race in America still fascinate some . </seg>
<seg id="34">a researcher at the American entrepreneurial institute Christina Соммерс , author of &quot; Who stole feminism ? , &quot; she said She The People that young men in the United States , especially colored young men , &quot; are much more vulnerable than their sisters , &quot; but value Стайнем about Фергюсоне contrary to criticism , which it clear earlier . </seg>
<seg id="35">now we have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for the boys . </seg>
<seg id="36">but when the White House has recently initiated a programme , &quot; Сторож to my brother , &quot; to help the vulnerable black and испаноговорящим boys , followed changed remarkably reaction from many feminists , including Gloria Стайнем . </seg>
<seg id="37">police with the black community is not the only problem , продвигающая helm of traditional feminism . </seg>
<seg id="38">after that border the United States arrested around 63000 minors without support on the southwestern border of the country this year , immigration reform again came to the surface - this time as a problem for women . </seg>
<seg id="39">Andrea Меркадо , co-chair of the organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform , said that in order to apply this issue as important for women , she had only to share stories of immigrant women . </seg>
<seg id="40">&quot; they speak for themselves , &quot; said Меркадо . </seg>
<seg id="41">when the vast majority of working visas are issued &#91; иммигрантам-мужчинам &#93; , women who come to them , find themselves in positions vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation . </seg>

<seg id="2">this week the Ministry of Economic Development will make the government a comprehensive plan for the development of clean vehicles in Russia , told the deputy director of the ministry , Oleg Плужников at the round table , which held the business newspaper Vedomosti at the Moscow show - 2014 . </seg>
<seg id="3">the plan drawn up on behalf of the government , one of the main goals - reducing emissions of greenhouse gases . </seg>
<seg id="4">it is expected that the document will be passed in late September and early October , says Плужников , the proposed measures concerning electric cars and hybrids - a development plan for the vehicles to газомоторном fuel in Russia are already there . </seg>
<seg id="5">the plan ( a copy of the Vedomosti ) is designed for 2014-2017 . </seg>
<seg id="6">yet to develop assessment criteria for electrical and hybrid vehicles , and to decide how to promote the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles . </seg>
<seg id="7">a report to the government , which will describe the tax and customs measures to support quality , will be prepared by December 2014 ; scheme of preferential loans and preferential leasing will emerge by April 2015 ; and the proposal to reduce prices , stimulate and create a suitable infrastructure will be developed by October 2015 </seg>

<seg id="9">in addition , federal officials plan for 2015 to formulate for the regional government proposals to also promote the use of clean transport - in the form of granting him benefits when driving and parking , for example ; and by February 2016 - and suggestions about the expansion of government purchases of such transport . </seg>
<seg id="10">finally , the Ministry of Economic Development by October 2014 will bring in a list of indicators for evaluation of the activities of the regional authorities of criteria that reflect the effectiveness of the support for the production of clean transport development in charge of infrastructure . </seg>

<seg id="13">but opened growth does not Sunderland any visible : in 2013 , according to the Association of European Businesses , sold segment million passenger cars and light commercial vehicles . </seg>
<seg id="14">while in Russia , Sunderland imports only Mitsubishi Motors . </seg>
<seg id="15">start import preparing Renault - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients , says director for strategic planning and partnerships , Renault &apos;s Nicolas Ремиз . </seg>
<seg id="16">most of the other manufacturers of electric vehicles took in relation to Russia is taking a wait-and-see approach . </seg>
<seg id="17">development of electric cars have and the producer - &quot; &quot; GAZ directors , &quot; but the мизерный . </seg>
<seg id="18">for example , in January - July 2014 , according to the &quot; АСМ-холдинга , &quot; Avtovaz has issued 30 electric cars . </seg>
<seg id="19">demand is modest because of soaring prices , admits director of AvtoVAZ by pharmaceutical Sergei Аманов , without state support the breakthrough in this segment will not . </seg>
<seg id="20">the development of the Russian market in electric cars in addition to the cost of cars ( those electric cars that are sold in Russia , on average , twice as much as counterparts with the internal combustion engine ( ICE ) holds an underdeveloped charge infrastructure ( retails sites &quot; unit ) , the sighs of &quot; Автостата &quot; Sergei Целиков . </seg>
<seg id="21">because of the cost and the low pace of reducing the cost of electric cars in the next 3-4 years remain нишевым segment of the Russian market , forecasts editor in chief &quot; Авторевю &quot; Mikhail Подорожанский , Целиков with him , agrees . </seg>
<seg id="22">car manufacturers , in contrast , say that some models of electric cars is already close to the value of the ordinary . </seg>
<seg id="23">the Russian market is substantially good prospects , the important thing is to instill confidence in consumers that &quot; электромобильность &quot; real ; this , in particular , will contribute to the emergence of new charging stations , underscores the President of BMW &apos;s Wolfgang Шлимме . </seg>
<seg id="24">such infrastructure projects will , for example , the &quot; Россети &quot; : in Moscow , constructed a few stations , soon there will be about 80 . </seg>
<seg id="25">talks about building a network of retails sites is underway and with other regions . </seg>
<seg id="26">according to the director of the department &quot; Россетей Vladimir Софьина , the company believes the market for electric cars and is ready to build gas stations across the country , but there are problems : a small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging different brands . </seg>
<seg id="27">in addition , &quot; Россети &quot; as network the company does not have the right to engage in the sale of electricity , the opportunity to do this in relation to charging . </seg>
<seg id="28">Pankov believes the most effective measure of state formation in Russia market substantially progeSOFT customs duties . </seg>
<seg id="29">zero rate will act before the end of 2014 , its renewal and expansion of the preferential list . </seg>
<seg id="30">replacing the transportation tax to environmental ( the idea is being discussed , and applies to all vehicles ) also support the market , but not as noticeably as customs preferences , said Pankov . </seg>
<seg id="31">vehicle tax in Russia is relatively small , &quot; says Pankov , unlike , for example , from Norway , where the reduced tax rate led to a sharp rise in sales of electric cars -- now they account for 12 % of the market . </seg>
<seg id="32">Russia needed and stimulus measures , such as free parking in the centre of town ( as it has done in Moscow ) , I am sure Pankov , or any movement substantially in dedicated lanes , which Russia has not . </seg>

<seg id="7">the weakening of the ruble is long-term in nature and , in tandem with the euro , and in tandem with the U.S. dollar . </seg>
<seg id="8">the long-term forecast assumed that mark , &quot; says senior analyst &quot; Alpari &quot; Anna Bodrov &apos;s . </seg>
<seg id="9">all of that has to do with Ukraine , one way or another will be reflected on the courses . </seg>
<seg id="10">as long as this continues , investors will react . </seg>

<seg id="18">still , will look at whether to impose on Saturday promised sanctions , as will meet NATO . </seg>
<seg id="19">the ruble , according to him , severely weakened after the end of tax season , then went to the news on Ukraine , the Central Bank said last week that , until the end of the year will be transferred to a floating exchange rate and waives any currency interventions . </seg>
<seg id="20">if you look at the daytime wobble , it is no different from the previous ones during this month , all have spooked that mark in 37 rubles , &quot; continued the analyst . </seg>
<seg id="21">and so , in terms of turnover nothing powerful never happened . </seg>
<seg id="22">worrying times for the currency market were , as I recall when , in late January , was the strong demand for the currency , as well as 3rd March , when the Central Bank отгрузил a record number of currency . </seg>

<seg id="24">first of all , this increase in the revenue part of the budget from the export operations , as well as improving the competitiveness of domestic manufacturers at the expense of more expensive imports , &quot; says chief analyst with UFS IC Alexei Kozlov . </seg>
<seg id="25">the negative moments can be attributed price of imported goods and services . </seg>
<seg id="26">sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency to significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy , rising inflationary pressures and , as a result , have become the cause of more expensive borrowing money , which , in turn , slows down the development of the economy . </seg>
<seg id="27">if we talk about the stock market , the depreciation of the ruble several smoothes over the prices of shares , expressed in roubles . </seg>
<seg id="28">for example , MICEX Index during trading Thursday fell 1.67 percent and the RTS had lost 3.27 percent . </seg>
<seg id="29">such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of reduction of indices due to the weakening of the ruble during the day more than 1.5 per cent . </seg>
<seg id="30">the weakening of the ruble is an emotional character and can be explained by a massive desire to buy the currency . </seg>
<seg id="31">in practice , gradually emotions go on there , and quotes the ruble partially or fully restore lost ground . </seg>
<seg id="32">&quot; we believe , soon we will be able to see the value of the dollar and the Russian currency is near the level of 36 rubles to the dollar , &quot; said Alexei Kozlov . </seg>

<seg id="1">the tax burden on entrepreneurs in the Washington area is growing as the economic recovery </seg>
<seg id="2">восстанавливающаяся economy means more customers , the more sales and jobs . </seg>
<seg id="3">it also means higher taxes . </seg>
<seg id="4">account for taxes on the state and local level for companies across the country , moderately increased in the last year , when an accelerated recovery , according to a new study , published last week , and the company in the Washington area is no exception . </seg>
<seg id="5">the company in the District , Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $ 27.6 billion in the coffers of the state and local level in fiscal 2013 , to 3.8 percent more than the $ 26.6 billion collected in 2012 . </seg>
<seg id="6">the tax burden on business in the state and local level in the past year rose by 4.3 per cent , to $ 671 billion , compared with 3.9 per cent the year before , and it was the third consecutive year of growth after avoiding each other years when account disparities , in 2009 and 2010 . </seg>
<seg id="7">taxes , has grown faster , 4.3 percent , than the local taxes , 3.9 percent , according to the study , which was conducted by providing professional services , Ernst &amp; Young and the Center for taxable state group on tax policy . </seg>
<seg id="8">more than half of tax revenue in the county , 56 percent , in taxes on entrepreneurs , while 36 per cent of tax revenues Maryland falls on firms . </seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia , with 28 percent , is the lowest amount of tax revenue , proportionally , from entrepreneurs . </seg>
<seg id="10">to a large extent , growth in tax revenues caused by returning to the same level of value of property companies , say the researchers , that raised taxes on real estate at 3.7 percent this year , after three years in a row , when growth was less than 1 percent . </seg>
<seg id="11">while a large proportion of those earnings in larger states , such as California , New York and Texas , it appears that the same thing is happening in the Washington area . </seg>
<seg id="12">the company in the District , Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $ 10 billion property taxes in the state and local level in the past year , to $ 9.6 billion more than in 2012 - a growth of 4.2 per cent , compared with the previous year . </seg>
<seg id="13">however , the return of the value of the property does not have a similar effect on the growth of tax revenues at state and local level in Maryland , where property taxes barely exceed one-fifth of the tax bills of companies . </seg>
<seg id="14">company , Virginia and the District of Columbia are paying about half the tax bills on the state and local level , in the form of taxes on real estate . </seg>
<seg id="15">&quot; what is happening in Maryland is that such a large part of their property , particularly tax base around the District of Columbia , is owned by either the government or nonprofit organization that does not pay taxes on real estate , &quot; said Douglas Линдхолм , executive director of the Center on taxation . </seg>
<seg id="16">thus , Maryland forced much rely more on , for example , income taxes to pay for those services that exist in other states . </seg>
<seg id="17">the recent increase in tax receipts from businesses cannot fully explain the recovery of the real estate market . </seg>
<seg id="18">income entrepreneurs are also , it seems , are on the mend , according to this data . </seg>
<seg id="19">companies in the region , Chinese companies may increasingly raise capital corporate income tax at a level of $ 2.3 billion to $ 2.1 billion more than in 2012 . </seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland has collected $ 1 billion of corporate income tax , most of all in the region . </seg>
<seg id="21">although the trend in one direction , the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level is growing with the same speed in all three areas . </seg>
<seg id="22">the level of growth in the District of Columbia was on the same level as the average for the country of 4.3 per cent , while growth in Maryland was significantly faster , 4.9 percent . </seg>
<seg id="23">only in Virginia was lifting tax receipts lower than average , equal to 4.1 per cent . </seg>
<seg id="24">in Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax from three jurisdictions ( each of whom the same corporate rate ) equal to 6 per cent . </seg>
<seg id="25">in Maryland corporate rate of 8.25 percent , whereas in the District is relatively high - 9,975 percent . </seg>
<seg id="26">a similar study of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that in Virginia lower taxes for entrepreneurs in the state and local level and , on the whole , a more favorable climate in terms of taxes for entrepreneurs than in Maryland . </seg>
<seg id="27">the county has not assessed in this study . </seg>
<seg id="28">despite his advantage , Virginia faces competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south . </seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina recently signed a legislative act that corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent , the same as in Virginia , and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the next year . </seg>
<seg id="30">if the state continues to reach targets on tax moves into the country in the next year , this law could raise the rate of income tax for entrepreneurs , even up to 3 per cent by 2017 . </seg>
<seg id="31">meanwhile , a small business in the Washington area , it seems , feels better and , thus , pay more taxes on the state and local level , according to a recent study . </seg>
<seg id="32">taxes for entrepreneurs , paid in the form of individual income tax , the owners of small businesses is a transitional structure , in which the things most small firms - in the District of Columbia , Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $ 2.4 billion , with much greater speed of growth than taxes for предпринимателй in general . </seg>
<seg id="33">the researchers say that the trend and an increase in revenues from taxes on businesses across the country are likely to persist this year , with the proceeds of tax on turnover in the governments of the state and local level , staying at 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year . </seg>

<seg id="39">санкционное menu </seg>
<seg id="40">on August 6 , President Vladimir Putin signed a decree applying specific economic measures to ensure the security of Russia , which is basically food sanctions . </seg>
<seg id="41">the country banned import beef , pork , meat and offal names from poultry , meat , fish , shellfish , milk , yogurt , cheese , cheese , vegetables , fruit , nuts , sausage and sugar syrups . </seg>
<seg id="42">if restaurants began чехарда with suppliers : prices of products grown , you must urgently seek counterparts from other countries . </seg>
<seg id="43">all this will have an impact on expensive restaurants with монокухней France , Italy , Spain , in which products supplied directly from the &quot; maternal &quot; countries . </seg>
<seg id="44">общепиту accounted for education and earlier . </seg>
<seg id="45">for example , when , at the beginning of 2014 , the Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef , and the year before - the American and Canadian meat . </seg>
<seg id="46">in return , providers have supplies of beef from Argentina , Uruguay and New Zealand . </seg>
<seg id="47">but sanctions лета-2014 proved to be far more serious . </seg>
<seg id="48">however , on August 20 , Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree , which lifted the ban fry Atlantic salmon and trout , безлактозное milk , seed potatoes , сахарную corn , peas and onions for replanting . </seg>
<seg id="49">the Italian Валерио hopes that sanctions might still смягчиться . </seg>
<seg id="50">in the meantime , some restaurants are in conditions of uncertainty . </seg>
<seg id="51">according to the company , &quot; East-West &quot; , one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa , the proportion of imported products in the premium segment accounted for up to 70 % . </seg>
<seg id="52">&quot; the expensive restaurants may change menus under the produce of local farmers and other countries , &quot; says Sergei Mironov , Resurrection , owner of the agency &quot; Рестконсалт . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="53">if we are strong , for him it &apos;s not going to be a problem . </seg>
<seg id="54">but we have very little such chefs , and the development of new menu items may take two to three months . </seg>
<seg id="55">Тригель from restaurant Brasserie Bridge &quot; prepared : refuse will be between 10-15 % of the dishes , even half of the menu - to recycle . </seg>
<seg id="56">in restaurants with the mixed cuisine are already starting to replace dishes , for example steak from the marble beef - on Beef Stroganoff , says Sergei Mironov . </seg>
<seg id="57">&quot; the cheeses from Europe can be replaced with Russian , Belarusian cheeses and cheeses from Serbia , Argentina , Tunisia , Chile - lists the &quot; East-West &quot; Oksana Глибчук . </seg>
<seg id="58">cream and milk products from Europe have counterparts in Russia and Belarus . </seg>
<seg id="59">chicken from the United States may be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus , salmon and семга from Norway - salmon , семгой , those from Belarus and Chile . </seg>
<seg id="60">the absence of vegetables and fruits of European production may be at the expense of domestic manufacturers , proposals from Serbia , Moldova and China . </seg>
<seg id="61">according to Mironov , Budget network restaurants re-build will be easier than премиальному segment : unlikely there were all able to distinguish the Italian mozzarella is from the Russian . </seg>
<seg id="62">although it is difficult to have institutions Ginza Project , he says . </seg>
<seg id="63">the Ginza Project , several dozen restaurants under various brands and with their menu . </seg>
<seg id="64">the replacement will take plenty of time , &quot; said Mironov . </seg>

<seg id="71">in establishments Колбаи until it is removed from the menu of a single cuisine . </seg>
<seg id="72">Timur colon , owner of the restaurants &quot; Чайхона N1 &quot; with Uzbek cuisine , sanctions also might alert : change will only sausages in New Zealand . </seg>
<seg id="73">if Russia our owned imports from Uzbekistan , Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan , we even win in price , for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe , &quot; he says . </seg>
<seg id="74">from the CIS can be cheaper to get to engineering , sausages , tomatoes , cucumbers , fruit . </seg>
<seg id="75">the fact that brought from Central Asia , much better than the &quot; plastic &quot; from Italy , Spain and Turkey . </seg>

<seg id="21">in recent times , this tool is gaining popularity , as rates here are higher than on bank deposits . </seg>
<seg id="22">in fact , savings certificates on bearer does not fall into a system of deposit insurance and bank they are cheaper because they don &apos;t have to make payments to the Fund Deposit Insurance Agency ( pointed out ) . </seg>
<seg id="23">successfully situation in the fact that this step is planned to be taken for small and medium-size banks , spreading such certificates , and suffer from Sberbank and Bank of Moscow , which is estimated to have pointed , controlling 98 % of the level of the market . </seg>
<seg id="24">with the Bank of Moscow , according to the agency , which is about 3.5 percent . </seg>

<seg id="26">some depositors , not having sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates on bearer , may assume that their investment is insured . </seg>

<seg id="14">the United States , even took a bit of sanctions . </seg>
<seg id="15">as regards the Ukrainian events , then they themselves and the response to guide Belarus only invoked another influx of this process . </seg>
<seg id="16">Minsk , on the one hand , managed to preserve relations with Ukraine are warm , so not much to lose in mutual trade , and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for talks . </seg>
<seg id="17">on the other hand , the Belarusian leader , which the Senate has not recognized the annexation of Crimea by Russia and urged to punish pro-Russian militia in the Donbas with all severity , not quarreled with Moscow . </seg>
<seg id="18">Minsk has not released any of the Customs Union , nor from the Collective Security Treaty Organisation ( CSTO ) , and the web is a Russian air base . </seg>
<seg id="19">Brussels and Washington have noticed a balanced position of Minsk to the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated her confident Belarusian experts . </seg>
<seg id="20">how successful will the movement Lukashenko to a policy of diversification , will be seen as often in the near future , cut-price ever take meetings in the format of the EU + TC . </seg>
<seg id="21">the press office of the EU High Representative for foreign policy and diplomacy Catherine Ashton failed to answer questions about what Brussels expects relations in the new format . </seg>
<seg id="22">a spokesman for Ashton Maya Косьянчич only said &quot; Огоньку &quot; that , on issues of war and peace , this issue is not a priority . </seg>
<seg id="23">while there are reports that following a meeting on the Ukraine issue involving officials in the new format may be , and Kazakhstan . </seg>
<seg id="24">a drop of tar in Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev , in which he admitted that about him , it turns out , personally asked representatives of the European Union . </seg>
<seg id="25">nevertheless , the final briefing Alexander Lukashenko made it clear : all sides are not against that Minsk remained a central platform for meetings , both in format Россия--ОБСЕ--Украина , and at the level of Heads of State and high representatives of the European Commission . </seg>
<seg id="26">this means that &quot; the last dictator in Europe &quot; acquires the status of quite рукопожатного European leader who helps solve a global problem . </seg>
<seg id="27">the best friend of the European farmer </seg>
<seg id="28">the delegation , which included еврокомиссаров on trade and energy , pushed to the conclusion : the main underlying reason for the summit -- not the tragic situation in the Donbas , and economy . </seg>
<seg id="29">in fact , сверстанное meeting schedule future talks on the gas supply and to overcome the fear of CU in agreement about an association between Ukraine and the EU looks like an achievement and more extensive than peace declaration without specific dates and numbers . </seg>
<seg id="30">Trade Commissioner Karl De Гюхт , nevertheless , indicates : EU officials &quot; arrived in Minsk seek solution to the political crisis which has economic consequences , and not vice versa . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="31">it seems , however , that the economic crisis in Ukraine &quot; works &quot; in Belarus . </seg>
<seg id="32">its consequences - and primarily reciprocal sanctions imposed by the West and Russia , offer cut-price , who until he feels санкционное pressure , with room for maneuver . </seg>
<seg id="33">according to the leader of the Research Center of Mises , Belarus Yaroslav Романчука , European investors are actively interested in opportunities for exports of agricultural products to the Russian Federation in bypassing sanctions . </seg>
<seg id="34">the nominated delivery scheme , for which President Vladimir Putin at the summit пожурил Minsk . </seg>
<seg id="35">&quot; billions of these schemes , &quot; said Romanchuk &quot; Огоньку , &quot; are not the Belarusian businessmen and Russian companies . </seg>
<seg id="36">they have long worked on a scheme of supplies of goods , including from Poland , Germany , Lithuania , and today these schemes were destroyed . </seg>
<seg id="37">Russian business badly needs to somehow restore them , even through the mediation of the Belarusian authorities . </seg>
<seg id="38">the second story , &quot; continues the expert , is connected with the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not averse to establish production in Belarus from the raw materials are also focusing on the Russian market . </seg>
<seg id="39">the Ukrainian producers about $ 4 billion of exports to Russia , and the Belarusian производственно-торговые scheme now could prove very popular . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="40">according to Романчука , the role of the host venue for the negotiations between the EU and the CU is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of the development of economic ties with Europe . </seg>
<seg id="41">he recalls that the loss of the agrarian sector of EU sanctions against Moscow are estimated at 5-10 billion euros , and the Commission is currently proposed 5.45 only 125 million euros in compensation . </seg>
<seg id="42">the Belarusian president could offer to Brussels to work together to minimise the consequences for еврофермеров . </seg>
<seg id="43">this could raise the authority of Lukashenko to the EU to unprecedented heights . </seg>
<seg id="44">hospitality without initiatives </seg>
<seg id="45">Catherine Ashton thanked the authorities for the initiative for the summit . </seg>
<seg id="46">but the paradox is that Minsk from his active role in birth format TS + EU открещивается , and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with Ukrainian counterpart emphasized that the new format and it was . </seg>
<seg id="47">&quot; it was your suggestion to come , without any навала discuss , not with бухты-барахты decide , after signing the Association Agreement with the EU , to sort out the situation , which at that time was in Ukraine , &quot; he said , before the cameras by Peter Poroshenko . </seg>
<seg id="48">however , observers interpreted it as an attempt to mollify Moscow , she reportedly was initially against the intermediation of Minsk , which greatly increases his political weight . </seg>
<seg id="49">in Belarusian diplomatic establishment carefully stress that Belarus when organising cooperation between the EU and the TA on their soil did not pursue a lucrative target , but the ultimate goal of this format is to create in the future , a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok . </seg>
<seg id="50">&quot; this is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts which , in other fields , in particular in the field of security , and promotes the leadership of our strategic ally , the Russian Federation , &quot; said &quot; Огоньку &quot; at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus , establishment , where in recent years carefully select words . </seg>

<seg id="1">Putin demands from Kiev to start negotiations on the &quot; statehood &quot; of eastern Ukraine </seg>
<seg id="2">according to Russian news reports about his comments , Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded Sunday that the Ukrainian government has stopped fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately started negotiations on the &quot; statehood &quot; отделившегося region . </seg>
<seg id="3">his spokesman , Dmitry Peskov , later discloses that Putin had in mind the hint that восточноукраинская territory controlled by separatists will become part of Russia , but that her status within Ukraine should be revised to give русскоговорящему region the opportunity to defend their rights and interests . </seg>
<seg id="4">however , calling Putin to Kyiv government to start talks with the government-controlled insurgents as equals with obvious strategy , which he follows from the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago : to help rebels take territory and force the Ukrainian government give новопровозглашенной territory Новороссии de facto independence , to closer ties with Russia rather than with the West . </seg>
<seg id="5">in an interview with state First Channel television , Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return retained the separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions , which were seized in March and April , after Moscow аннексировала Ukrainian peninsula Crimea on March 18 . </seg>
<seg id="6">the Kremlin and the separatists recently called the captured territory Новороссией , or New Russia , the name , which refers to the дореволюционным days of the glory of the Russian Empire . </seg>
<seg id="7">Putin said that anyone who believes that peace talks will occur in the near future , as Ukrainian politicians to campaign for parliamentary elections on October 26 , and while government troops attack peace settlement in detained separatists regions , &quot; пленник illusions &quot; , according to Itar-Tass . </seg>
<seg id="8">&quot; we must immediately begin substantive talks and not only technical issues but also on the political organization of society and the national status of Southeast Ukraine , in order to serve the interests of the people living there , &quot; he said . </seg>
<seg id="9">Peskov said that Putin about statehood had in mind in the context of a broader autonomy that was discussed during months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to allay fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and language rights at risk . </seg>
<seg id="10">only the Ukrainian government may give eastern regions the necessary autonomy , Peskov said . </seg>
<seg id="11">it is not a matter for discussion between Russia and Ukraine , Peskov said , &quot; because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , and an internal Ukrainian conflict . &quot; </seg>
<seg id="12">interference with press secretary the Kremlin to rectify &quot; incorrect interpretation &quot; words , Putin stressed the Russian leadership to behave toward breakaway rebellion in the east in any other way than to open the seizure of Crimea , where the majority of 2-миллионного population are ethnic Russians . </seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow had to withstand much more heavy battle to attach even Donetsk and Луганскую region of eastern Ukraine , as the majority of the 6.5 million residents are Russians , and polls before the start of the conflict , showed broad support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine . </seg>
<seg id="14">autonomy , which Russian diplomats discussed at international forums gave regional governments in the Ukraine power to trade agreements and foreign policy , essentially giving the Kremlin the de facto control of the territory , which would be teamed the main territory of Russia with unverifiable . </seg>

<seg id="18">however , his opinion on autonomy , it seems , is very different from the view of the Kremlin and повстанцев-сепаратистов , ITAR-Tass and abetting which accuse Moscow . </seg>
<seg id="19">last call for Putin to Kiev to negotiate with the leaders of the separatists , with both equal , followed by new наступлениями rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks rolled into eastern Ukraine out of the formerly peaceful area along the Sea of Azov . </seg>

<seg id="21">it led to a massive civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol , a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants , which is located between Новоазовском and narrow 27 on the Crimean peninsula . </seg>

<seg id="2">сердитое expression is biologically universal for all mankind , and everyone involved in its creation of body and the muscle is not fortuitous , but an additional means of expressing power and threat , researchers have found in Australia and the US . </seg>

<seg id="4">good facial expression - joined and his down eyebrows , вытянутые in thin line your lips , &apos; bloated nostrils - equally in all cultures , and make it even blind from birth , children never who , says lead author of the study , Aaron Селл . </seg>
<seg id="5">as part of a major research project on the nature of the anger , the scientists found that arose this emotion for the effective conduct of disputes during the conflict . </seg>
<seg id="6">the more physical damage one man can do to another , the more he had opportunities to dictate their terms , and bring it up to partner with anger . </seg>
<seg id="7">the researchers found the confirmation of another of his hypothesis : physically strong , people often get angry and switch to pitch invasions , consider themselves entitled to impose other disadvantageous conditions for them , and they prefer the methods of solving conflicts peacefully . </seg>
<seg id="8">extrapolating from that anger is primarily &quot; emotion of bargaining , &quot; the scientists decided that the movement of each of the seven groups of muscles , creating сердитое expression must represent гневающегося individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of a friend - and thereby force as soon as possible to agree to its terms in order to avoid conflict . </seg>
<seg id="9">to test this hypothesis , the researchers have modelled on a computer , where they had or was absent , each of the seven items гневного faces , and showed them but . </seg>
<seg id="10">although his eyebrows or have forward , chin individually do face evil , portrayed with such traits humans stronger physically , the study participants acknowledged unanimously . </seg>
