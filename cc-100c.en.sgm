<seg id="1">Recalling a very American ideal that labor rights are human rights</seg>
<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have offered the bill, which is protected by the unions as a civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Where unions, jobs and the middle class," says Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, who is co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive factions.</seg>
<seg id="4">That's why I proudly represent Act expanding workers ’ rights, together with the symbol of the movement for civil rights by John Lewis.</seg>
<seg id="5">This bill will give workers the same opportunities for legal discrimination against trade union organization, and other forms of discrimination, opponents of trade union power</seg>
<seg id="6">The change of the law on the regulation of labour relations in such a way as to allow the workers encountering discrimination for participation in trade union organizations, to seek justice in the civil courts, and compensation and punitive damages payments - a sensible and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it's certainly not radical initiative - at least by American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the best way to deal with that, ” Ellison, Lewis and co-authors of the bill, "recall is a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the attacks, which the unions have in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country, Americans once supported countries all over the world to adopt, to expand and to respect human rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time, remember, millions of Americans, when this country simultaneously defend democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas MacArthur and his assistants have helped the country to adopt a constitution, in order to guarantee that which my Хидеки Тодзё was replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included text that explicitly admitted that "the right of workers to organize and to negotiate, and the collective action is guaranteed."</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Эйзенхауер and his assistants have helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that fascism Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recognizing that workers will need to be organized and be heard in the new state, the Germans have included an article that openly stated: "The right to form associations with the aim to protect and improve employment and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or activity.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict or seek to diminish that right, will have no legal force; measures for these purposes, be considered illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">When former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which was World Declaration of Human Rights, which in 1948, will be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to organize and join unions to protect their interests."</seg>
<seg id="17">Generations of Americans took as its baseline the position that labor rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this construction, about how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans have explained that the right to organize labor unions - and the fact that this union has participated as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - should be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now, when these rights are under attack in America, wisely, really, to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to ensure that their voices were heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the Reverend Martin Luther King said: "Fifty years ago.</seg>
<seg id="21">History is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now everyone knows that the trade union movement is not undermined the nation's power, but increased them.</seg>
<seg id="23">Raising the living standards of millions, unions miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to fragile level of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack the unions, forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.</seg>
<seg id="25">History remembers as we should.</seg>
<seg id="26">The official recognition of labour rights as human rights and the protection of civil rights, to prevent discrimination against the trade union organizations, was long overdue.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the U.S., a federal judge on Sunday temporarily has blocked the introduction of the Louisiana law, which his supporters say that he, most likely, will close all five абортных clinics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to this measure, which was signed by the Governor of Louisiana Bobby Джинадлом in June and was supposed to go into effect on 1 September, doctors who do abortions, must have been to have powers of patients in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the adjudicator's decision means that, at the moment, doctors can continue to do legal abortions, while continuing to look for such powers.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally, continuing actions to gain power," he wrote in his decision, Judge John деГрэвеллз.</seg>
<seg id="6">The hearing will be scheduled within the next month, at which the judge made a more permanent solution on this law.</seg>
<seg id="7">Advocates for abortion rights welcomed the decision, the latest in a chain of decisions against similar measures, saying it will give doctors more time to receive hospital authority.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today's decision ensures that the women will be protected today from the Louisiana law, which seeks to deprive them of the health and human rights," said Nancy Нортап, president and head of the Center for reproductive Rights, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of the law to stop three of the five clinics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the decision to doctors from two clinics, which were claimants in the case, and also filed a request for authority.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, and the courts recently acknowledged such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="11">Key parts of texas law that would have closed most of the remaining clinics in this state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fighters for the right to abortion, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association say that laws about the credentials of doctors to impose restrictions, which are not necessary from the medical point of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, though some also pointed to positive effect in the closing clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only one doctor who does abortions in Louisiana, have the reception in the hospital, said the Center for reproductive Rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all the other doctors in the state will be forced to stop performing the procedure, the doctor, fearing for their safety, could no longer perform the procedure, told the group.</seg>
<seg id="16">Criticizing the decision, officials in Louisiana said that will not punish doctors doing abortions as long as their statements on the reception waiting for solutions.</seg>

<seg id="1">What will the introduction of quotas for domestic products</seg>
<seg id="2">Not less than half of products for each type of product in the range trading networks should be the Russian production, says the State Duma deputy from Just Russia, Oleg Nilov.</seg>
<seg id="3">The MP has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures for domestic manufacturers, writes the newspaper Izvestia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The document will still детализироваться, in order to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.</seg>
<seg id="5">This applies to goods that are produced in Russia. <... > According to the rest of the groups of products, which are produced in Russia, the will provide at least half of the production of their domestic producers, "Nilov told the publication.</seg>
<seg id="6">Together with the amendments to the article "On the basis of state regulation of trading activities in the Russian Federation," the bill provides for the introduction of changes to the Tax Code, laying down a 10% rate of VAT in Norway with the implementation of the products produced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea to introduce a 50% quota in -процентную retail chains included in the stimulus package for Russian producers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The shop will be several times more than domestic goods.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the initiative could have both a positive and a negative effect, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to attorney Налоговик ", a member of an independent expert for Public Duma Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive in nature, and will lead to growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">The gallery will be key, farmers, and small shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">They will be able to sell more, and it means that profits will grow.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms to retailers and prices, because they will be forced to buy their goods.</seg>
<seg id="14">Russian manufacturers will be able to increase the volume of its sales activities and that will lead to pay higher taxes than before.</seg>
<seg id="15">This will increase budget revenues, will create new jobs, any industry will begin to expand any faster осваиваться, will be introduced to contribute to the growth of GDP.</seg>
<seg id="16">Russia's dependence on foreign food fall several times, though not immediately, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="17">Earlier, Russian companies are often unable to fight their way to the shelves of local stores due to higher competition from foreign counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now, after the introduction of an embargo, this niche freed, and you can breathe a sigh of relief.</seg>
<seg id="19">But do not forget that, after all the necessary approvals and sanitary inspections of food products to the Russian market will come from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="20">In other words, the "moment of calm" when the players are already gone, and the new has not yet come.</seg>
<seg id="21">Almost a month later, you can talk about the modern demand for Russian raw materials, as well as rising prices for finished products, "said Vice President АиФ.ru first all-Russian" Russian club financial directors, Tamara Kasyanov.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clearly, the idea to sell in each category at least 50% of the Russian food products will be the sector for local producers.</seg>
<seg id="23">In that case, they will compete with each other, and not with goods that subsidies at the expense of another state, are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="24">In other words, the fight for the buyer will unfold between companies in the industry. ”</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, says Kasyanov, Russian producers are able to meet 50% of domestic needs compatriots not on all items.</seg>
<seg id="26">And in this situation commercial networks will have "дотягивать" share of Russian goods up to half of the range.</seg>
<seg id="27">In this regard, increasing fears that the shelves are substandard goods.</seg>
<seg id="28">Maybe, under the guise of produced in Russia, will be delivered to foreign products with перебитыми labels, "adds an expert.</seg>
<seg id="29">A negative effect from the introduction of quotas are large trading networks, especially those which выгодней cooperate with importers.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is logical that the minister will suffer and foreign suppliers, because the demand for their products drop.</seg>
<seg id="31">Litvinenko did not rule out that the law on quotas on domestic goods may impact on consumers.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fact is that some of the Russian-made products can yield quality imported ones, while shops will be boosting prices on the second as a scarce commodity.</seg>
<seg id="33">The revolutions in the early 2000s, the idea of import substitution economists started talking again in February this year because of the ongoing devaluation of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="34">Now, against the background of difficult relations with the West, the question of the import of products becomes even more urgent.</seg>
<seg id="35">The law aims to compel retailers under orders to suppliers to domestic producers.</seg>
<seg id="36">Then we will go much faster and more confident on the path of import substitution, and the planning system needed for the production of products will be created in a shorter period of time, "says the MP Oleg Nilov.</seg>
<seg id="37">Especially effective mechanism will be staying for the agricultural sector, where the potential is especially high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.</seg>
<seg id="38">Our farmers are able to fully cover the shelves in Russian shops.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition, a powerful impulse can receive and manage production.</seg>

<seg id="1">Inflation out of the vacation.</seg>
<seg id="2">Whether the Russians will feel the sharp increase in prices</seg>
<seg id="3">As a result of Western sanctions and the November inflation accelerates in Russia and not in forecasts уложится authorities, analysts believe, "VTB Capital."</seg>
<seg id="4">According to experts, the deferred effects антисанкций will lead to inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the latest forecast, inflation in 2014 will be 6,5-7,5%, in the next year or less - 6.5%.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to the newspaper, "Kommersant," the commentary this week should make a "small but significant" changes in macroeconomic forecast up to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the publication, the agency ’ s assessment of inflation in 2015, which will eliminate progeSOFT expected revenue growth of the population.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the forecast, it was assumed that the food sanctions apply a year - until August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">In such a situation, you could assume such high inflation?</seg>
<seg id="10">The current situation involves разовый shock, but понижательный trend of inflation does not change, "said the source of the newspapers in so far.</seg>
<seg id="11">Economists from VTB Capital does not share expectations and block the government on inflation and the forecast price growth in 2014 at the level of 8%.</seg>
<seg id="12">The main effect of product bans will come together with the possible introduction in the regions of the Russian Federation sales tax (GAP) in 2015, the experts are convinced.</seg>
<seg id="13">Inflationary spike in 9% in February, after which the annual pace of price growth will decline, experts believe.</seg>
<seg id="14">By the way, last week, Rosstat, let the first inflation results, after Russia imposed sanctions "accurate."</seg>
<seg id="15">АиФ.ru interviewed experts and found their inflationary expectations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Artem Деев, head of the analytical department of FC AForex:</seg>
<seg id="17">Prices have already observed in key segments.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moreover, when I began to appreciate the socially significant products, the government was forced to launch measures of monitoring systemic risks to price stability, in order to prevent unreasonable price increases in the short term.</seg>
<seg id="19">Suppliers and retailers already report on a daily basis before regulators that authorities knew exactly who was where and for what reason will trigger an increase in prices.</seg>
<seg id="20">Key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continues to be tremendous pace of capital flight, excessive refinancing the banking sector from the Russian мегарегулятора, convert the flight of foreign currency, as well as an embargo on the imports of food products from the countries that joined the sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="21">If inflationary pressures remained under control, the cost of a minimum basket of products not jumped to 12 per cent in just one quarter.</seg>
<seg id="22">A ban on the import of food products provoked shock proposals on the internal market and led to a higher cost of логичному.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because at this stage we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, and increase self-sufficiency of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production, retaliatory sanctions continue to bear the risks of inflationary growth component.</seg>
<seg id="24">If you add another here and fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as ухудшенными prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year, inflation could exceed 8%.</seg>
<seg id="25">Alexander Разуваев, director of the analytical department of Alpari. ""</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 1990s, inflation sometimes hit 20-30% per month to zero, it was also higher than the current level, another thing that then it is offset by rapid economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="27">I think, at the end of the year inflation will be 8-8,5%.</seg>
<seg id="28">Plato Магута, managing assets of the Criminal Code, "the Fund Магута"</seg>
<seg id="29">An external factor associated with sanctions against Russia, while successfully contained, but if there is further increasing the pressure, first of all, the financial sector - this can lead to a certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations, which usually manifest themselves in traditionally purchases of currency to protect their savings.</seg>
<seg id="30">It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance will soften the weakening rouble, as well as current market practices and government regulation.</seg>
<seg id="31">But prices traditionally begins after a lull over the summer and, possibly, this fall will become more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="32">The target level of consumer inflation in Russia to 7.5%, most likely, a weapon, as Russia has another dividend.</seg>

<seg id="15">"As far as the proposed settlements on the constructive elements, in practice this is difficult to light, as well as in the construction of buildings often use different technologies," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is no secret that стройрынок develops, thanks largely to the госзаказу.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the Chairman of the Management Board of the NP "expert opinion" Catherine Лезиной procurement professionals community, today the state is the most effective customer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Deputy director of the pharmaceutical industry for Rosatom capital construction Vladimir Malakhov drew attention to the fact that, today, the market can be divided into the companies, which have access to a portfolio of contracts, and the companies that hold monopolies competence and does not allow for this field of competitors.</seg>
<seg id="19">He believes that the creation of a transparent market may only be provided when access to contracts will be as Turkey manager from someone's impact.</seg>
<seg id="20">The expert council was asked to form a government in such a way that one and the same performer may not receive more than one contract for more than $1 billion rubles, or several contracts worth more than $1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="21">In минстрое believe that this approach must be evaluated from the point of view of the business impact, and effectiveness of management.</seg>
<seg id="22">As explained by Elena Zhukova, in this case, you will need to endow customer functions, which will lead to an increase in the number of customer and budgetary expenditure on its content.</seg>
<seg id="23">The customer will need to have the knowledge to assess the quality of work performed by contractors, as well as their security.</seg>
<seg id="24">Often with this Government, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the security of an object as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of highly skilled participants in connection with the state in obtaining state Reserve in part-time work and a small amount of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="26">The deputy head of the Institute of procurement экспертно-консультационного Alexander Евсташенков believes that now the government has turned to the business of the game as good as they possibly can.</seg>
<seg id="27">And this example: "A participant when filling in the application must specify" specific performance "without the words" or equivalent "," should "," "," "more," "less than," "similar" "or", "type", "a similar type," "lower," "lower," "higher," "can," "may," "might," "earlier" and "not previously," not "higher," "not allowed" and so on.</seg>
<seg id="28">Thus, customers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of applications of contractors.</seg>
<seg id="29">Another problem, according to 44-ФЗ Евсташенкова, was the need to assess the application of the "paper" proposal.</seg>
<seg id="30">Considering the application, you can really only assess a contractor skills, but not the quality of the work, in which not even began, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="31">The quality of the works can be assessed only when their acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="32">The expert council was also asked to take a margin income from the upper echelon to have disappeared in the lower intermediate contractors.</seg>
<seg id="33">The chairman of the expert committee, and espionage FAS Andrei Цариковский believes that it should not, as responsible for the order should генподрядчик.</seg>
<seg id="34">But otherwise, as in the famous репризе Arkady Raikin normalises sleeping: "Пуговицам claims to have?"</seg>

<seg id="2">In the former home of золотопромышленников and горнозаводчиков Евдокима and his son Ivan Демидова on the street of the October Revolution, 57 / 1 (former Big hats) 18 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="3">The house since the 18th century buildings not changed, if not considered ветхость.</seg>
<seg id="4">People here go, on excursion, and tenants are more than delighted, from his privilege - the right to live in the house, the walls of which price старейшем remember commander Alexander Suvorov.</seg>
<seg id="5">The date of the house amongst others, historians point to the two dates - 1730 and 1737.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in any case, it turns out that the nearly 300 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The old yard, always open the door, squeaky staircase.</seg>
<seg id="8">The doors in the apartments are located near each other, the chair covers were cracked, and the peeling plaster просветы places visible from the street.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is all on us.</seg>
<seg id="10">But local residents are told: "You don't think it is."</seg>
<seg id="11">To live in a wooden house in the 18th century, it is very difficult, "says Tatiana 1961, a resident of apartment # 3.</seg>
<seg id="12">The object is to госохране, but money for its content is not tens of years, and we feel museum exhibits, about which the authorities simply have forgotten....</seg>
<seg id="13">The last renovation was 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The walls still hold great difficulties, but the foundation of the entire прогнил.</seg>
<seg id="15">Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, and моются once a week in a public bath.</seg>
<seg id="16">How can you be content in such conditions?</seg>
<seg id="17">The road passes directly under the windows, even a pedestrian zone.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tatiana dented behind.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now you can see that this was only heard: Under the windows of the car rushes.</seg>
<seg id="20">You see, glass дребезжат constantly, can't open a window, and got used to the noise.</seg>
<seg id="21">A man gets used to the same, for good and bad.</seg>
<seg id="22">Our apartment still top, thanks to her husband, hands him the gold.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, two rooms, three of them live with her son.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for other families, the conditions are much worse, no ceilings on the second floor of a little more than one and a half metres tall.</seg>
<seg id="25">In contrast, Tatiana offers to go to her apartment from the No. 6 Lyudmila Старостиной.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nice friendly woman with threshold offers up a cup of coffee and with a sad smile said:</seg>
<seg id="27">We have a one-bedroom apartment, 14.5 m ² for four people, and we live with my husband and daughter, with her granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="28">I am here with the birth, another boundary was never, "Lyudmila обводит eyes room: You're buying two sofas, the letter" g "; one of them was the granddaughter with a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="29">Very closely and differs little from a domestic interior: Only ceilings, beautiful "historical."</seg>
<seg id="30">But with the ceiling regularly flows: Tap system worn.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lyudmila said about his apartment and at the same time, simply as an Italian house, which stands on the Roman ruins.</seg>
<seg id="32">They have brought in a very old and recent, everyday and legendary:</seg>
<seg id="33">Water spent about 40 years ago during the last repair.</seg>
<seg id="34">It made us a small kitchen and bathroom in закутке from former чулана.</seg>
<seg id="35">We live just there where квартировал Demidov family, lived on the second floor of the servants.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our apartment is privatised, and why?</seg>
<seg id="37">In the real estate, the privatization of Ufa said.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still get only a one-bedroom apartment can't qualify for more.</seg>
<seg id="39">Already four months ago, promised us расселить, but promises it will not matter.</seg>
<seg id="40">Not used to complain and I will not.</seg>
<seg id="41">In this apartment (room!) lived for an entire dynasty: My grandparents, my mom and dad, I'm with my husband and my daughter, with her granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="42">Things happened during that time.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, big rats ran in the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="44">Look at the walls, they флигеля one-meter wide thickness.</seg>
<seg id="45">They say the solution was involved in eggs, so long rests.</seg>
<seg id="46">The house built thoroughly Демидовым, thank you!</seg>
<seg id="47">Perhaps, but so far no one killed or сваей обрушившимся ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="48">Only construction still slowly dying in his eyes: The board and log homes of putrefaction, floors have repeatedly failed, pouring cement, but all it takes is a solution to the earth, as well.</seg>
<seg id="49">They say and have, under our room the concealed лаз and move to the river White, who had once lived in the old Believers, to hide from danger, in which case....</seg>
<seg id="50">Their campaign.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lyudmila Старостина tells how it came to be a historian, pleaded to let that he began excavations in the apartment.</seg>
<seg id="52">And then urged to give them housing space in exchange for its однушку in October.</seg>
<seg id="53">Lyudmila historian refused:</seg>
<seg id="54">Where are we with over однушку?</seg>
<seg id="55">And here at least a tiny hope is that will give housing.</seg>
<seg id="56">We agree on the exchange, would not have won.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, the family Старостиных nothing and not won.</seg>
<seg id="58">The biggest dream, Ludmila расселили, and daughter with one 16-year-old granddaughter gave a separate room.</seg>
<seg id="59">The two families have identified two-room apartment instead of the majestic ruins, in which two generations living now.</seg>
<seg id="60">Pretty, Olesya Карсакова миниатюрная girl from No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.</seg>
<seg id="61">In two cramped squeezed into airless apartments with a total area of 23 m ², apartments, lives with her large family.</seg>
<seg id="62">We just seven people, two children.</seg>
<seg id="63">See for yourself what conditions.</seg>
<seg id="64">Your butt falls off pieces of plaster and window frames, the walls in the kitchen, and the cross-cutting holes.</seg>
<seg id="65">The water in the кране only cold all year round.</seg>
<seg id="66">Walking about the apartments in the old house, so you can make sure that all lucky Лаврентьевым spouses from the No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="67">They occupy the most spacious rooms of the first floor.</seg>
<seg id="68">You are right, a lot of places.</seg>
<seg id="69">The 75 square, directed by three people.</seg>
<seg id="70">We live in those rooms, where legend has it stopped police during his stay in the stock, "said Alexander Lavrentyev, the head of the family.</seg>
<seg id="71">High ceilings, spacious.</seg>
<seg id="72">One bad - all around the train wreck of apart, collapsing.</seg>
<seg id="73">Neighbors probably already told.</seg>
<seg id="74">The more suffering we have with floors, wooden boards сгнили, literally from under the feet of the ground beneath.</seg>
<seg id="75">I put подпорки, wedges; in the hall still nothing, and in another room, but on a seesaw качаемся, so all was not cemented.</seg>
<seg id="76">The merchant house Евдокима Демидова Aleksandr Dmitrievich can tell you better than any guide.</seg>
<seg id="77">The золотопромышленнику refers to the native, speaks of it with admiration.</seg>
<seg id="78">Indeed, the personality and the owner was fantastic: Кагинского Узянского plants built houses, отливал guns and bells, kept уральские mines.</seg>
<seg id="79">The heirs of the estate, but white merchants are proud to live under one roof with history.</seg>
<seg id="80">I lived here as a kid, in the 1940s, the 20th century, "says Alexander.</seg>
<seg id="81">Then around stood wooden room / barn and sentry boxes, subsequently снесенные.</seg>
<seg id="82">In 1968, wanted to remove, and our home, but something prevented the....</seg>
<seg id="83">The same story was repeated again in 2014: Поманили new housing.</seg>
<seg id="84">We, as a team, gathered all the necessary documents, обегали, and suddenly learned that moving to an apartment in 2015 or 2016.</seg>
<seg id="85">Something already doesn't believe in all this....</seg>
<seg id="86">Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan, to learn the fate of their homes.</seg>
<seg id="87">Officials of the occupier was not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="88">Sent from one desk to another, and then, as mockery, given without a signature piece of paper and printing: "The Ministry of Culture does not argue against the resettlement of tenants."</seg>
<seg id="89">Even though I have a feeling that our house for a long time, not in terms of the city, because he was under the number 57, then became 57 A, now 57 / 1.</seg>
<seg id="90">As if he had already been demolished in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="91">"A planet" to the head of the land management sector informational-analytical resources Ufa Vladimir Барабашу.</seg>
<seg id="92">A house on the street of the October Revolution, 57 / 1 is included in the resettlement of old housing.</seg>
<seg id="93">I can't be responsible for the actions of officials in the 1970s, only know that at the time there was a plan for the demolition of old buildings, despite the historical significance.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the authorities is to rebuild the old house on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value, "successfully.</seg>
<seg id="95">Tenants in the planned расселить on new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="96">According to Барабаша, restore Демидова House will be Italian experts who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="97">Now Italy is architectural, and project "Old Ufa" is there among others.</seg>
<seg id="98">I hope that by 2016 all former Old Street hats will be cozy, "says the official.</seg>
<seg id="99">At home, the corresponding gain proper, which was earlier, three centuries ago.</seg>
<seg id="100">The house Демидова, is likely to become a museum, open to all comers.</seg>
<seg id="101">In addition, the government decided to make the street at the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="102">On weekdays, unfortunately, too much workload of roads in the city.</seg>
<seg id="103">People from the future museum расселить Vladimir Barabas promises in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="104">However, it is unlikely that they will be happy with their new apartments will be of the same area, and that the current.</seg>

<seg id="2">Never say, "I love you"</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was one of seven children born to a family of immigrants from Jamaica in Dudley in is in 1958.</seg>
<seg id="4">His father, who died when Henry was 19, he worked in a factory, and their relationship has been limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry preparing comedy, "Rudi Редкие records," which is partially based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew up in a series of programmes on Radio 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mix of 199.4 and rap, and melodies - жизнерадостны.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Henry had to get through some difficult memories of childhood.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the death of his mother was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often mused about the relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was very inaccessible.</seg>
<seg id="10">You never saw his face, you only hear his voice: "Don't make noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Отстань from sisters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Шевелись!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch the cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton that were adults, when I was a child, walked with him in the pub and talk about such things as a form of beer glasses, the beauty of the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">I have never talked with him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was so неулыбчивым guy in the corner, reading a newspaper which is a big part of my life.</seg>
<seg id="17">Henry recently opened a studio in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in the days of his father, he was able to look at what must have been his life.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now there's a little bit better, but it is deep, dark, дымные лабиринтов netherworld with outbreaks of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father залезал in a bathtub and just lay there, and you have heard, as he slowly begins to sing about themselves, because he wanted to отмыться from broadcasting studio.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I came back, I realised that he was doing this for years and years, to earn money for us, and I began to appreciate it more.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nevertheless, Henry came from a childhood devoid of parental love.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never hugged, never said: "I love you."</seg>
<seg id="23">It was only when her mother became ill at the end of her life, we started to talk: "I love you, I love you, I love you.</seg>
<seg id="24">The birth of her own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love with which he lacked as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">You can stop it, "I love you"?</seg>
<seg id="26">Just don't hug me.</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I'm 22.</seg>
<seg id="28">With Don French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why would I not be friends with her?</seg>
<seg id="30">She's a great mother</seg>
<seg id="31">They are still great friends with the French, to whom he was married for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="32">Don is a good man.</seg>
<seg id="33">Why would I not be friends with Don?</seg>
<seg id="34">She's a great mom.</seg>
<seg id="35">Henry was the mother of the diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="36">He was the one that killed her.</seg>
<seg id="37">So, when I was very, very recovered and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "you have to take radical measures.</seg>
<seg id="38">Then I began serious training фитенсом, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="40">And it's boring.</seg>
<seg id="41">No one eats carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">A change of career trajectories of Henry reflected, perhaps, in his noble, briefly подстриженной beard.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he received the recognition of critics for his Othello, he completely immersed in theatre.</seg>
<seg id="44">It was followed by "Комедия errors," and then "hotel" Огаста Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">This work is different from sitcoms and comedies that were неотъемлимым attribute his busy professional life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He started his career, when he was 16 and worked in a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">DJ noticed, as he is a parody on the stage, and wrote about it in "new faces."</seg>
<seg id="48">His career in television began in the mid seventies: "Quite a long time I was the only black пародистом / comic on television."</seg>
<seg id="49">He studied at work.</seg>
<seg id="50">I not only had to grow in the eyes of the public, I had to learn how to be an efficient vehicle for the delivery of jokes between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working on TV, and it was very hard.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny in "New faces" in 1975</seg>
<seg id="52">As his manager had to show "Black and white minstrels," light entertainment program, in which people "чернили themselves face," Henry found that is in it for five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">My family is a very disliked.</seg>
<seg id="54">I, like, hopefully, this will never be with me, but I don't regret that I did it.</seg>
<seg id="55">Though it was a strange, worthy of condemnation, I worked on large venues and work with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="56">But the fact that it was "all light entertainment awards on British television classics for years and years," and it was "a grotesque parody of black people."</seg>

<seg id="58">The first season of "Show Lenny Henry" was broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as, among other things, the chef Гэрет Блэклок from the comedy series "Biased."</seg>
<seg id="59">Commercials, documentaries, TV shows and roles in movies took the following ten years of his life, but after his series on the BBC in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "what are you going to do next, Len, because a little, it seems that you're тянешь or сворачиваешь quietly to the side."</seg>
<seg id="60">Next was a series of documentaries for Radio 4 called "What's good in...?"</seg>
<seg id="61">The first was about Шекспире.</seg>
<seg id="62">I was allergic to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">That is not to say that I really have been taught this at school, and I thought that this is, in many ways, the prerogative of white middle class people with колготками and cabbage at the bottom of the front.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I am very afraid of him.</seg>
<seg id="65">Everything, from whom we took an interview for transmission, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Денч, said: "You have to try.</seg>
<seg id="66">Not ругай it, as long as you don't know what you are talking about.</seg>
<seg id="67">Произнеси aloud some of these words, and you will understand why we are all so fond of Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry read 20 rows last monologue from Othello for the documentary, and his зацепило.</seg>

<seg id="72">So, the process of rehearsals was tough, and I read this play for months and months before we got her.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">It seemed that they had been waiting for disaster, but it has not happened.</seg>
<seg id="75">Soon we began "Комедию mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I was at the National Theatre, and I just could not believe it until the end.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you have changed."</seg>
<seg id="78">A technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his case - to entertain the public.</seg>
<seg id="79">"The voice inside me said:" You have to work 10 minutes until they чинят computer. "</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead, the assistant director, announced that view will resume as soon as the problem will be solved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I walked away from the scene and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."</seg>
<seg id="82">It's not my responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can't let someone else deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="84">"You're playing in, stay in the role of". "</seg>

<seg id="92">I love being in the репетиционном hall.</seg>
<seg id="93">By the way, Henry still thinking comic - all the way our conversation перебивают flashes his humor, when it starts, it finishes to parody.</seg>
<seg id="94">I just decided not to work in стендапе, because this thing with instant gratification from a room full of strangers, I think, quite dangerous.</seg>

<seg id="4">And then she пожимала hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">He saw in his irritability.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was колючим as hair, yes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The latest victim of this колючести was little novel, from which he waited longer than usual, the lonely and boring life, and perhaps even some satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Эйлинн Соломонз was pulsating with fragile beautiful взлохмаченными hair and трепещущим heart of northern island village, even more remote and harsh than Port Ройбен.</seg>
<seg id="9">She came to the south with спутницей older, which Кеверн believed her aunt, while the latter was in a house in crude, but similar to the joyous paradise under the name "Райская Valley."</seg>
<seg id="10">No one lived in the house for several years.</seg>
<seg id="11">In a trickling pipes, sat motionless, spiders слизни left their footprints on all the windows, confident that the house belongs to them; зарос garden weeds, similar to giant кочаны cabbage.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was like a cottage from the book for children, while frightening and enchanting, with a garden full of secrets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Opinion of the author: Howard Джейкобсон, whose novel "J" is included in the лонг-лист Букеровской Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">The shortlist will be announced next week</seg>
<seg id="15">Кеверн Эйлинн and sat, holding hands, broken sun loungers in the high grass, enjoying surprisingly warm spring day; they both "connected to your console, which provided cheap country music and appeasing 3-zmianowy news, when, glancing at her brown crossed his legs, and he remembered the old song long forgotten black performer, which he loved to listen to his father, and curtains in the house.</seg>
<seg id="16">You've got big feet too.</seg>
<seg id="17">In view of the inherent aggressiveness, the type of songs to the console is not lost.</seg>
<seg id="18">They were not banned - nothing in fact was not allowed - just not to lose.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have helped to become архаичными, as the word "archaic."</seg>
<seg id="20">Public taste did what would have never managed to achieve orders and regulations, and, as people choose among books of memoirs rich, staying in poverty, cooking the books and novels, from the music they chose ballads.</seg>
<seg id="21">This afternoon, увлекшись Кеверн began playing the piano ideation and comic voice praise Эйлинн big feet.</seg>
<seg id="22">Эйлинн not understood.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It was popular to jazz pianist, who was Фэтс Уоллер," he said, mechanically placing two fingers to his lips.</seg>
<seg id="24">So did his father to stop the letter "J" before she слетит with his lips.</seg>
<seg id="25">It started with the game, in which they played when he was little.</seg>
<seg id="26">His father played it with his father, as he told him.</seg>
<seg id="27">Start with the word "J," forgetting put two fingers to his mouth, "and it will cost you a penny.</seg>
<seg id="28">It was not a very fun game then, and it was not very fun right now.</seg>
<seg id="29">He knew that from him for this, that's all.</seg>
<seg id="30">He had to explain what is jazz.</seg>
<seg id="31">Эйлинн never heard.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jazz is playing, even though he was not explicitly prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="33">Improvisation went out of fashion.</seg>
<seg id="34">In life, there is only one "if."</seg>
<seg id="35">When the music started, people wanted to know exactly where it will end.</seg>
<seg id="36">With wit in exactly the same way.</seg>
<seg id="37">His unpredictability had acted on people's nerves.</seg>
<seg id="38">But jazz was wit, with music.</seg>
<seg id="39">Though he has reached the age of 10 years, never слышав about Sammy Дэвисе Младшем Кеверн, knew about the jazz from the paternal полусекретной коллеции CDs.</seg>
<seg id="40">But at least he did not have to speak Эйлинн that Фэтс Уоллер was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">Given her age, it is unlikely that she remembered a time when popular singers were not black.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again, there are no laws or pressure.</seg>
<seg id="43">Society was docile, and this meant that each segment agreed with gratitude - the gratitude of those spared the fate of the group, with the principle of predispositions.</seg>
<seg id="44">People афро-карибского origin in temperament and physical characteristics are suitable for entertainment and sports, and they sang and ran.</seg>

<seg id="48">Each according to his abilities.</seg>
<seg id="49">As she had heard only Эйлинн ballads, it was hard to understand how offensive words that just sung her Кеверн, could be set to music.</seg>
<seg id="50">Music is an expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">"They are not really offensive," said Кеверн.</seg>
<seg id="52">Except, maybe, for people who have great legs.</seg>
<seg id="53">My father never offended anybody, but he loved this song.</seg>
<seg id="54">He said too many, but launched a garden gave him the illusion of security.</seg>
<seg id="55">No word could not penetrate the soundproofing giant leaves, similar to капустные.</seg>
<seg id="56">Эйлинн still did not understand.</seg>
<seg id="57">As your father could love?</seg>
<seg id="58">He wanted to say that this is a joke, but he did not like her singing again with two fingers to his lips.</seg>
<seg id="59">She already thought it strange.</seg>
<seg id="60">"To him it seemed funny," he said instead.</seg>
<seg id="61">Clearly, she shook her head, closed Кеверну review.</seg>
<seg id="62">The whole world was nothing but копны иссиня-черных her hair.</seg>
<seg id="63">Nothing, that he would like to watch.</seg>
<seg id="64">"Well, if you say so," she said, in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="65">But this still does not explain why I sing it.</seg>
<seg id="66">She seemed really upset.</seg>
<seg id="67">I have too big feet?</seg>

<seg id="77">I have such a perversion.</seg>
<seg id="78">It was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="79">He wanted to, so it was funny.</seg>
<seg id="80">Attempts to joke often made him awkward situation, because, like his father, he was missing the soothing charm, which could mitigate the cruelty, крывшуюся in thereof.</seg>
<seg id="81">It may be that his father wanted to be cruel.</seg>
<seg id="82">Could be, and he, like Кеверн.</seg>
<seg id="83">Despite the good eye.</seg>
<seg id="84">Эйлинн Соломонз she blushed and stood up with the push опрокинув console and Strait of wine that they drank.</seg>
<seg id="85">The wine's intoxication, so that he could not serve as an excuse.</seg>

<seg id="89">He was sorry for her and because of the excessive brutality of his words, and because of fear, who appeared in her eyes when she gave him offside.</seg>
<seg id="90">Did she, that he hit her?</seg>
<seg id="91">She has not talked to him about life in the cold of the northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that, in basic terms, it was like a здешнюю.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same huge icy ocean struck on both of them.</seg>
<seg id="93">Are the same as the men, even more sensitive and capricious after that happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened than their ancestors, and the smugglers разрушители, wandering from pub to pub in fury, ready to raise a hand on any woman, or to deny them their посмевшую поддразнить.</seg>
<seg id="94">Amounts to pointless head?</seg>
<seg id="95">They would have shown her a fist, if she was not cautious.</seg>
<seg id="96">Would be first kissed, kiss now became the most common erotic expression of irritation between a man and a woman; an antidote to the fresh ballads, too, which Google is the first kiss her, and then hit.</seg>
<seg id="97">Excessive clarification, according to Кеверна because the kiss itself was already хулиганством.</seg>
<seg id="98">Эйлинн Соломонз case showed that he needs to leave.</seg>
<seg id="99">He got up from the push, as an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She herself felt the lead weight, but the weight of his grief surprised her.</seg>
<seg id="101">This was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They barely knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">She looked, as he goes, and from the upper windows looked, as he leaves, her companion, the man himself, the rigors of взваливший.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam, the outgoing garden, she thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">She felt a stab of sympathy towards him and men in general, even though some of them and raised her hand.</seg>
<seg id="106">The man, from the pulpit, отвернувшийся back пристыженный сраженный, the ability to fight left him - why she felt she knew so well, if she could not recall a single case, until today, when she saw it?</seg>
<seg id="107">Again one Эйлинн Соломонз looked at their feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">In the twenty years prior to the above events or so Эсме Нуссбаум, an intelligent and energetic 32-летняя исследовательница, which worked in "Офнау", an informal service control over Community mood, has prepared a report on the saving low and middle level of violence in most parts of the country, where it was expected that it will be reduced, if not lifted entirely, given the means and the forces that were in its eradication.</seg>
<seg id="109">"A lot was done, and a lot is being done," she wrote, "in order to mitigate the innate aggressiveness of people who fought in a war and won most of them, especially among these спутанных branches and narrow расселин area, where, despite just over изгородями spires of churches, gentle breath of human kindness was rarely in history.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, some quality, it turns out, неискоренимы.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher the spire, it would seem, the низменнее those passions that he зарождает.</seg>
<seg id="112">The population of sheds tears over the sentimental stories about drinking, skipping преодоленных obstacles and announces its overheated faith in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness retains its strong grip as in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is evidence that a new depth and vile задиристость in homes, in the workplace, on roads and even in playgrounds.</seg>
<seg id="113">"You have a habit of payments to write too much," said her supervisor, read the report as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="114">It seems to me, you should read shorter novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">Эсме Нуссбаум lowered her head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask you: You атеистка?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I think that is not obliged to answer," replied Эсме Нуссбаум.</seg>
<seg id="118">Are you gay?</seg>
<seg id="119">Эсме again insisted on his right to privacy and silence.</seg>
<seg id="120">Feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Again, silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I ask," said Luther Рабиновиц, "not because I am against atheism, лесбийства or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">Here we have no prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="124">We are the servants of society without prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="125">But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely reasonable and a good in themselves, they may sometimes distort the results, such as, for example, those that you showed me.</seg>
<seg id="126">It is obvious that you yourself предубеждены against the church, and what you call "malevolent" and "rude", others would be interpreted as an expression of natural and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="127">To continue the нудеть BUT THAT happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened, as if it had happened, if at all, has happened yesterday, it means depriving the country needed her life force.</seg>
<seg id="128">Эсме Нуссбаум огляделась for parties, while Рабиновиц said.</seg>
<seg id="129">In his head, pink, as well as equipment, led the letter repeated advice that "Офнау" gave the country the last quarter of a century or more.</seg>
<seg id="130">Улыбайся his neighbour, energy of his spouse, listen up, walk, talk on the phone to organise, communicate, heart, listen, соглашайся, извиняйся.</seg>
<seg id="131">The conversation is better than silence, the word any better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I fully understand that you want to say," quietly replied Эсме Нуссбаум, when satisfied that her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I don't want to say anything, except that we are not излечились as efficiently as we convince ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">I am concerned about is that if we do not, we will find that repeat mistakes, which initially led to the ТОМУ ВООБЩЕ IF THAT happened, happened.</seg>
<seg id="134">Only this time we выбросим their anger and distrust, not on the other.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Рабиновиц joined the tips of his fingers in a sitting.</seg>
<seg id="136">That gesture was supposed to mean an infinite patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"You go too far," he said, "calling" mistakes "actions that made or not made our grandfathers.</seg>
<seg id="138">You go too far and when talking about the fact that they threw their "anger" and "mistrust" in the "other."</seg>
<seg id="139">In your place, people should not need to: The fact that, in the past, the present, we are not talking about "us" and "them."</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "us" and no "other."</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a mess, and that's all that we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"For which, to be honest with ourselves," ventured Эсме insert, "no one part of society may well justify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am not accusing anyone.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it's bad or good, what is done is done.</seg>
<seg id="145">Then it was back then.</seg>
<seg id="146">Nothing to say - here we agree.</seg>
<seg id="147">And don't blame anyone, not excuses, and if this was appropriate, or if there was something you can fix.</seg>
<seg id="148">But why, if not to learn "</seg>
<seg id="149">Past Update to ensure that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I can add to that one word -</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther's Great Pyramid Рабиновица collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I'll review your report," he said, and dismissed her.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, on the way to work, her biker who rode off on the sidewalk, passersby, described as "a vicious rage."</seg>

<seg id="2">Growth in the eurozone slowed to the lowest in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.</seg>
<seg id="3">The business index (PMI) for the eurozone manufacturing sector of the public fell to 50.7 in August, dropping from 20-25 in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">The above 50 indicates growth.</seg>
<seg id="5">New orders, and promote their businesses have suffered amid growing tension between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The meeting came before the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Markets will wait for the bank, a clear plan for how to deal with the eurozone ’ s recovery, as well as the threat of deflation, with inflation of just 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi later this week may give further signals that he is considering a scheme of quantitative easing in the eurozone, similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Although some growth is better than no growth, braking effect of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty for manufacturers is becoming more obvious," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at public.</seg>
<seg id="10">The manufacturing sector PMI in Germany, a major trade partner of Russia in the EU, has fallen to the lowest level in 11 months of 51.4.</seg>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile, the second largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.</seg>

<seg id="14">The industry is most likely still would add fuel to the fire, analysts anticipating the introduction of additional monetary or tax-based incentives.</seg>
<seg id="15">One positive was news from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.</seg>
<seg id="16">Howard Арчер, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that can be said about the August survey index of business activity in the manufacturing sector in the eurozone, it is that it shows that the sector still growing."</seg>
<seg id="17">He added: "Eurozone manufacturers, obviously, are finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension - particularly associated with the Russia / Ukraine, adds uncertainty still difficult conditions in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">This increased tensions, apparently hit by business - and especially in the confidence of consumers, and is likely to lead to the fact that some orders are delayed or even abolished, especially large orders.</seg>

<seg id="52">But I can now play computer games with shooting, and it's not a problem for me.</seg>

<seg id="54">I remember those kids with whom I played in the yard, which has not escaped.</seg>
<seg id="55">We never say that they killed or dead.</seg>
<seg id="56">We say that they stayed in the gym.</seg>
<seg id="57">I remember my trip to London so well, especially in a toy shop, where I was allowed to choose what I wanted, and travel in a car with an open.</seg>
<seg id="58">But now he is afraid for such places as Ukraine, where war leads to a grief that had he and his friends.</seg>
<seg id="59">This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him</seg>

<seg id="65">She vividly remembers his trip with Дамиром in London.</seg>
<seg id="66">People in London cried when I told our story.</seg>
<seg id="67">I realized then, as people on the other end of the earth can understand our feelings, can support.</seg>
<seg id="68">She was grateful to "Sheri Blair and its fund for the award and the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="69">I would like to call it, and the other is simply to say that 10 years have passed, but I still remember a meeting with her and her husband in London and how they helped Дамиру and me.</seg>
<seg id="70">I remember when Damir wanted to eat, they rang up all the local Russian restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="71">I remember how he played with in the restaurant, the waiters are Damir shot them from his water pistol, and they flee and played with him.</seg>
<seg id="72">And only one month has passed since our nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="73">I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and to support us.</seg>
<seg id="74">She said: "I think that this world was no better over these 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="75">Now in Ukraine there is a war, people are dying every day, and I think many children have been killed and will be killed.</seg>
<seg id="76">It's just the same as our children.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think for many people, war is a news broadcast, that they listen to when they get bored or when they are busy with something else.</seg>
<seg id="78">I just know that these people feel, the horror of it.</seg>
<seg id="79">And I can't stop feeling it.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.</seg>
<seg id="81">Damir grew up and became very soft and quiet as a boy, he's not an aggressive and angry.</seg>
<seg id="82">He is not looking for revenge, for example, he did not just fixed on it in this last nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not like to remember it, but they are very close with six classmates, and they go to a gym from time to time and burn candles there.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was younger, he suffered from this, I remember, as he lay on the couch, facing away from us, for hours.</seg>
<seg id="85">Not slept, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys. Дамиру now 17, he was above me, nice, smart and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that a few hours I was so sure that he is dead and that I never see more.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I was able to recover from the explosion and rose to his feet, I огляделась, I saw hell around himself, when parts of bodies were lying everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely sure that it is not possible to my little boy could survive in this hell.</seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember what I shouted to him:" Damir, убегай, "but again I was so sure that he had not heard.</seg>
<seg id="91">But he heard, and ran away.</seg>
<seg id="92">So life goes on for us, unlike so many others.</seg>
<seg id="93">Giorgi, 17 years</seg>
<seg id="94">The boy, whose shocking photo after capture was decisive for the Beslan tragedy</seg>
<seg id="95">Peace: Surviving Beslan Georgy Ilyin with their mother, Fatima after taking over in 2004, and to the right of Georgy today</seg>

<seg id="101">Because my only managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="102">The closer the date, the more difficult to think and talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="103">There is not a single day when we won't remember this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="104">We do not think that it was a long time ago, I think it was yesterday, some scenes these days all the time before my eyes.</seg>
<seg id="105">No one will never forget, I promise you.</seg>
<seg id="106">Западает in soul: George (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was увековечена in sculpture (right)</seg>
<seg id="107">I remember that, George wanted to go to school that day, said that a teacher who wants to embrace.</seg>
<seg id="108">I only found out that he was alive when I saw him on TV.</seg>
<seg id="109">And now even have the sculpture crying in San Marino.</seg>
<seg id="110">George doesn't like to look at this picture, and she was hidden in the closet at home.</seg>
<seg id="111">I understand, but I also think that the photos of people from all around the world feel our pain.</seg>
<seg id="112">George says now: "It is important that this never happened.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I doubt that we ever learn the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">People continue to investigate this tragedy and will never know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">Now they are investigating the collapse of the Boeings in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Will we ever know what it was called?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world is going to be something very bad.</seg>
<seg id="118">"I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, because it is happening?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing for this pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need to have a little bit of tens of years to forget it.</seg>
<seg id="121">It has affected my health, and I still feel it.</seg>
<seg id="122">About three or four years of nightmares because of me, but now it became better.</seg>
<seg id="123">I returned to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.</seg>
<seg id="124">I thought about my friends and одноклассниках, who were killed.</seg>

<seg id="141">"It seems to us that it was yesterday," says Giorgi, who wanted to learn from the intelligence officer in the Federal Security Service (FSB), but couldn't because of the damage that was caused by his health at the time of capture.</seg>

<seg id="152">With regard to the physical condition, I'm healthy.</seg>
<seg id="153">I need to be cautious with the knee, which was damaged, but now I go okay.</seg>
<seg id="154">But health is not allowed me to go to study at the Academy of the Federal Security Service (FSB) in St. Petersburg, as I wanted to.</seg>

<seg id="157">I studied there for two years.</seg>
<seg id="158">He learns to treat all animals from cats to cows. "</seg>
<seg id="159">He said: "I know that never will talk to their children about their experience.</seg>
<seg id="160">It is not what children should know, and, of course, is not what they need to survive.</seg>

<seg id="162">She's in my soul, and worse, when the anniversary is approaching.</seg>
<seg id="163">I will go and will attend the ceremonies, which will be held, to celebrate her.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know that George did not go.</seg>
<seg id="165">For him it should be even stronger, because he was there, and I'm not.</seg>

<seg id="167">I am so grateful to God that he came back to me.... Here in Beslan print lies on each.</seg>
<seg id="168">He remains with us.</seg>
<seg id="169">George, now an adult, but the nightmare was still with him.</seg>
<seg id="170">It is difficult to take when something so terribly unfair, happens to you.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was a boy, he loves the sport, but he can't do because of the knee.</seg>
<seg id="172">He had several operations, he can walk, but he can't exercise.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say that he was 50% more this nightmare, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.</seg>
<seg id="174">This eerie experience will remain with us.</seg>
<seg id="175">Many of my friends and neighbors had been killed during the capture, and this only reinforces my pain.</seg>
<seg id="176">I lost a lot of people who I knew well and who was my road.</seg>
<seg id="177">My son with me, and this is the best gift that God could I do, but my heart aches for those who had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know the family, where the children were born, but I know and widows who never married.</seg>
<seg id="179">It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.</seg>

<seg id="185">We were a close-knit country in the past, that we are fighting now?</seg>
<seg id="186">People and children are suffering, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine, and many will be killed.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips, how to achieve a better quality of underwater photos and video</seg>
<seg id="2">If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have a number of options.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is waterproof "Point and Shoot," for example, the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or, for example, GoPro mounts экшн-камера Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I took these pictures on a family holiday with the help of a few cameras, all for the price of about $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">No matter what equipment you are using, you need to comply with several regulations, in order to achieve the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Перепроверяйте their equipment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that battery cells and other branches of the tightly closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, the camera for the type of photos or videos that you shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some cameras and camcorders have regimes shooting or object type, which optimise exposure for затемненных underwater conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in the water, look at how deeply your equipment can fall.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are only 5 feet, others - 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Look at our leadership and the ratings for both traditional and digital cameras, as well as for exclusive models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Remove a few frames - because many of them never get.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Мыльниц" have LCD that can help you take, then assign them as экшн-камер usually are not.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have LCD, it will be difficult to see under the water, and the layout of the frame will be random process.</seg>
<seg id="16">So do a few frames.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also, if your camera is serial shooting mode, which takes several shots with a slightly different view, use them.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">The amount of light is significantly reduced, the deeper you нырнете under water.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, stay on the surface, when you're shooting in the pool, the river or the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">It will also allow you to transfer more colors in the photos; the deeper you get, the less you see color.</seg>
<seg id="22">Подплывайте closer to objects.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is excellent advice for shooting on the land, but it is even more important under water because of затемненных light conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is especially important if you're shooting on экшн-камеру: This equipment often comes with a fixed, широкоугольной Backwards, which means that you have to get closer to the object, if you want to fill the frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was such a man, whose force of personality could shake things around, even in such a giant organization like the National Health Service.</seg>
<seg id="2">Консультирующий anaesthetist, he has devoted his career needs of patients suffering from the disease, and of encouraging treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among those who spoke to him, recalls his wife, MI-6 officer who had to live with devastating effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that as long as doctors about being diagnosed and diseases, those who are being treated, mainly worried about something else -- the pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, however, he found himself, who began to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I never felt, as usual," he wrote in May last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">To me it was hard to find in themselves the strength.</seg>
<seg id="8">Struggling with symptoms similar to flu, he found that his wife, Джулиет reproaches irritably.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I wish it was sooner rather than later," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Джулиет went on for a week, Lawson found that unusual and it is not clear why he was upset.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked a colleague to chest X-rays.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks before he went skiing in the Alps.</seg>
<seg id="14">The results of the X-rays came.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was mesothelioma, a terminal cancer, which affects плевру, or the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="16">For most cancers, it is difficult to determine an exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although some people succumb to cancer of the lung, for example, not all cancer patients smoking lung.</seg>
<seg id="18">But with attributable to mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases the cause is contact with asbestos, grainy construction material, who once called a "miracle," but which, as is now known, mortally dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us is disease mesothelioma, which you can't pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos, in the end, is the material from the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in the UK since the 1960s, when these industrial ban came into force.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even when it has been used, only people from specific sectors worked in close contact with him: Трубоизолировщики, builders, carpenters and docks, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">Industrial toxin from another era, he hardly seems cause for concern today.</seg>
<seg id="25">But such a calm.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it turns out, is now at the peak of the epidemic мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="27">Here мезотелиомы dies from more people than in any other country on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="28">The annual death rate at about 2500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease than as a result of road accidents.</seg>
<seg id="29">The annual number of deaths from мезотелиомы since 1980 and projected the number of deaths in the UK in the future</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason we feel its deadly consequences right now, lies in the fact that, although the use of asbestos is illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), for the development of мезотелиомы go usually tens of years.</seg>
<seg id="31">And attack мезотелиомы is not limited to veterans specialties industrial construction.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was, and is, in many cases, remains in the house where we live, where we work, schools, where we learn, and shops, where we go shopping.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention in class, the level of income, profession or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">Избранности bastions, the fashionable London department stores to private schools, as it turned out, not salvation.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parliament building is riddled with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even hospitals that are meant to cure us of deadly reservoirs have proved to be a carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was not трубоизолировщиком.</seg>
<seg id="39">In fact, he had to think where he might have come into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he realized.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It seems that there might be asbestos in tunnels in the hospital, where I spent six years on the Convention," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">All are students, nurses, doctors and persons - used these тоннелями.</seg>
<seg id="43">I wonder how many of my peers expect the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">It was a question, to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial response.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Of the four doctors, which we in the hospital, Guy and subsequently developed mesothelioma for the past five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I alone remained alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us expect this disease?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Лоусону was diagnosed with mesothelioma, "" when he was 48 years old.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">To live so long.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty per cent of attributable to mesothelioma patients die within 8 months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is always fatal.</seg>
<seg id="52">So, now, we can only repeat Лоусона question: "How many of us expect this disease?"</seg>
<seg id="53">According to a leading expert in the UK, Professor Julian мезотелиоме Пито, most likely assume that the years between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain should an himself, by a man about to die.</seg>
<seg id="54">Now most are not, and that will die in this way.</seg>
<seg id="55">Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada, Alamy</seg>
<seg id="56">A quick review of reports from the halls of the court, where victims are often seek compensation, shows how far it has spread attack мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="57">In June, for example, Marks & Spencer, which was included in the recent Джэнис Ellen contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, clothing departments at two sites, one of which was the store on Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs Ellen was just 18 years old, when she started working at M & S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now her two children over the age of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Before this happened," she says, "I had never heard about мезотелиоме, I barely knew about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="62">And in my head I could not come to that, I will.</seg>
<seg id="63">Few people really know a lot about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="64">In fact, asbestos is not one substance, and a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">They get their name from the word "асбестиформ", which means the fibrous structure, which tells them the strength and flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="66">Of those six, three were often used in the construction.</seg>
<seg id="67">Widely known as chrysotile, or white asbestos, is much more common in other buildings today.</seg>
<seg id="68">It has been used in roofing panels, напольной tile thermal insulation, pipes, boilers, even in brake колодках cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">He смертелен less than other forms of asbestos, but all the same, as the European Union and the World Health Organization, "a source of serious health damage," which can lead to death.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, brown asbestos (амозит) and blue asbestos (крокидолит).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that "there are good, though indirect reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with attributable to mesothelioma [in the UK]."</seg>
<seg id="72">A worker at Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the main store on Oxford Street, London, Alamy</seg>
<seg id="73">Джэнис Ellen may not think of themselves as a victim, but the work of Julian мезотелиомы Пито suggests that her story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that a significant percentage of мезотелиом when there is no known exposure at work or at home, were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment. "</seg>
<seg id="75">Much of this impact, he says, is "a normal use and exposure to weather" in our building.</seg>
<seg id="76">No one, it seems, can't be sure that he is safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">The report Goddard Consulting, which was considered Westminster Palace, demonstrates how people, even in the heart of government, could be exposed to unconsciously.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009, Goddard said that technical mines and pipelines for the premises of parliamentary committees were infected with deadly asbestos fibres, which may have given the movement of something as harmless as "strong currents of air."</seg>
<seg id="79">Members of the parliament often blame the fact that they are pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.</seg>
<seg id="80">Although the Agency for maintenance of Parliament insisted that Westminster Palace received a "clean bill of health now," she acknowledged, however, that it is necessary to work on the £1 billion for the reconstruction of the Parliament, by upgrading electrician and removing asbestos, and that after the general election of 2015, members of parliament, will meet in the conference centre close to innovation, and not on the green benches related.</seg>
<seg id="81">The report Goddard said that "the situation with asbestos was ruled not in accordance with the various rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">It is impossible to know whether this error management cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All that you can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">One of those who could not identify their contact with asbestos, Graham is the cost, the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson, cost, 50 years, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I worked at the hospital, which has successfully brought claims associated with asbestos," he says, "But I can't prove this in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It's so hard to remember all the places, where he worked, and dates.</seg>
<seg id="88">He remembers clearly that day in early December 2009, when his wholly overcame something that was like the flu.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly were shaken as me.</seg>
<seg id="91">It started very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terrible.</seg>
<seg id="93">I thought I can't drive all the way to homes.</seg>
<seg id="94">Being a doctor, knew that the cost of the pain comes from checking for iframe loads, the shell around the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="95">However, as Джэнис Ellen, he just did not have reason to suspect мезотелиому.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the end, he could not walk to work a month.</seg>
<seg id="97">Озадаченные doctors doing chest x-rays and плевральные катетеры to pull fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis.</seg>
<seg id="98">And yet his condition оставлось without a diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">Gradually, his health has improved, and he returned to work.</seg>
<seg id="100">But from time to time, those same symptoms return, often after he was sports and was breathing hard.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, one of the patients came to him in the office – resonate grimly with similar symptoms, and he was later diagnosed with mesothelioma. ""</seg>
<seg id="102">But even then the cost is not associated with their own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">In the end, it was the patient for tens of years older and worked with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">In this case, the connection was obvious.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011 the state – resonate grimly deteriorated again, and listened to his doctor showed him the results of the CT and X-ray images of the group.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, exactly two years after the cost began to feel ill, sensor, equipped with a camera, was introduced in the cavity between the shell of his shell of his chest and lung.</seg>
<seg id="107">I'm an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I usually just go further, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="109">I'm not too upset about it, to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife was.</seg>
<seg id="111">The biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "They told me that this is mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham: Cost of diagnosed with mesothelioma</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly cost sank during a meeting with Macmillan nurses, one of which suggested he contact a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">It was then he realised the scale of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turns out that asbestos is widely used, especially in large public buildings, and where quite often there was asbestos once in the pipes," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, now succumb to the disease.</seg>
<seg id="117">Thus, mesothelioma now affects more young people, atypical professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous isolated asbestos pipes in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees, who were on the pedestrian tunnels connecting nearby landmasses can bring together, to get from one building to another (as Andrew Lawson), or ate in the basements of canteens (how often did Graham cost) almost certainly really were exposed to toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">For several decades after the war, it turns out, the hospital was a place where, in theory, pulled поциентов for life, but the place, which constituted a threat to life for doctors who treated them.</seg>
<seg id="121">It still continue to remove today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students set their burners Бунзена asbestos on tap</seg>
<seg id="123">And it's not just hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and мэриях due to their amazing and if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="125">Schools too.</seg>
<seg id="126">In fact, many for the first time, is likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="127">Across the country, countless chemistry lessons, students set their burners Бунзена asbestos on tap.</seg>
<seg id="128">There were websites, highlighting the problem of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as floor tiles or roof сараев, as a rule, contained asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"This is an industrial poison, in a huge number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Лоусона in a case against the hospital Guy.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case, the only contact, the woman could remember was the demolition garden shed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So be careful, снося garden sheds.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effect of the diagnosis, when we know that the disease is incurable, is huge.</seg>
<seg id="134">"To realize it, is quite a lot of time," says Graham cost.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to continue, but realized that I could not focus on what I'm doing.</seg>
<seg id="136">I had surgery in two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I realized that I have to go and deal with them.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I'm not a Christmas</seg>
<seg id="139">One of the most difficult things was the transition from doctor to patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">As countless patients before him, he remembers, was shot down with the amount of information that had to be taken.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was difficult to understand," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked my doctor," How much do I have time? "</seg>
<seg id="143">I had about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember, as I thought, "Well, I'm not a Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's all. "</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is a particularly dangerous, as it is the mechanics of how we are in life, "the very act of breathing, raises cancer, which kills.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases are caused by contact with asbestos мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos is composed of tiny fibers.</seg>
<seg id="149">When asbestos is being destroyed and the carcinogenic fibers, they can get stuck in плевре, shell.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibers are annoying плевру and can cause mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem is due to the inhalation of asbestos fibres matrix," Professor Tom Трежер кардиоторакальный, surgeon, who came to the hospital in 2001, Guy.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is the hospital, where Andrew Lawson, as suspected, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="153">Трежер Лоусона knew and treated some of the others who, perhaps, was exposed to while in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">When Sally Goodin Sally goodun Etc asbestos in the lung tissue, "says Трежер, breathing their course on the periphery, where the shell.</seg>
<seg id="155">It is, in its essence, invasive process from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="156">Conventional treatments of other forms of cancer is much less effective in мезотелиоме.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, cause hot debate.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some think it is worth a try.</seg>
<seg id="159">Трежер disagrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">"You can't cut плевру," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">No good around her with a knife.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, the cancer is "not very well to chemotherapy," which "acts", but not people.</seg>
<seg id="163">"From time to time there are patients who live a long time," says Трежер.</seg>
<seg id="164">But in the end, they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some patients are living much, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">Writer Stephen Jay Gould died in 20 years after he was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years after diagnosis, Graham cost continues to fight.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he became ill, attributable to mesothelioma – resonate grimly acquainted with Andrew Лоусоном, which, four years after the diagnosis, single-handedly turned in support and advice for patients.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Yes, Раковая Central," he said, cheerfully when they called.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," says cost.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was diagnosed four years ago, and he still is very energetic.</seg>
<seg id="172">First Эбботту offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and would have prolonged his life only a month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was in despair," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, managed to somewhat more positive agenda. "</seg>
<seg id="176">Meeting with several specialists, decided to continue the treatment cost with Professor Лоиком Ланж-Лаздунски торакальной, a professor of surgery at the hospital Guy.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage in that I don't need it, I just called them and they took me," admits Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">Likely the patient would have to get the direction and approval for funding.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money play a crucial role for patients with attributable to mesothelioma, in order to get the best available treatments.</seg>
<seg id="180">But when such treatments become ineffective, finally, inevitably, many patients are facing another financial reason for concern "about the future of the families that they will leave.</seg>
<seg id="181">And then they ask the courts for compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Морганом from Field Fisher Price Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It has been known that asbestos is harmful to health, in 1898," said Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But that changed in the 1960s, it became clear that even very small amounts can put their health at risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">It was then spoke about the bad faith.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson, and the hospital ultimately resolve the case, but it was not "the full cost of the settlement," according to Morgan, as Lawson could not clearly prove that it was the result of mesothelioma is exposure to asbestos at Guy's hospital.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation into his death, hospital spokesman Guy is confirmed, however, that "asbestos in its basement, mentioned above, was removed in the 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="188">It was too late for Andrew Лоусона.</seg>
<seg id="189">How to remove asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">In fact, tie deadly contact with asbestos to one company or place of work - usually through dozens of years after that, it turned out to be a big problem for patients with attributable to mesothelioma, demanding compensation.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have changed owner or shut down.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance archives could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who are protected from lawsuits, know that, on their side, which plaintiffs have, of course, no.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, this year took serious new legislative acts which facilitate the process of recovery attributable to mesothelioma patients with compensation, even if it is impossible to keep track of their former employers.</seg>
<seg id="195">In accordance with this law, was created by £350-миллионный fund of funds, which is financed by the insurance industry, for those who was diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove, but those with whom to sue.</seg>
<seg id="196">In such cases, patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in a case about the compensation of about £pirates.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful claims under this scheme is expected to be every year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with attributable to mesothelioma, believes that the £350 million represent a "very good work" for the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"This transaction, which insured for insurers," he says, hinting that the sum is a quarter of that, insurers would have to pay if it had not intervened, with a temporary period attributable to mesothelioma sufferers could track the company and file a lawsuit in the usual way.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even Mike Пеннинг, formerly the minister of labour and pensions, acknowledged that the law is imperfect. "</seg>
<seg id="201">But Пеннинг, and Morgan acknowledged that, in view of the fact that seven people die every day, rapid action was needed.</seg>
<seg id="202">"People suffer so much, and they need help now," said Пеннинг during the second reading of the Bill мезотелиоме in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">By the time Graham cost was in the hands of Professor Лоика Ланж-Лаздунски 19 months.</seg>
<seg id="204">After the initial consultation Ланж-Лаздунски recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Трежера, he believes to be effective.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was followed by chemotherapy and radiation for тритерапия - in which Ланж-Лаздунски can boast for 40 percent of patients surviving for five years.</seg>
<seg id="206">Cost of felt a surge of strength.</seg>
<seg id="207">"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says cost.</seg>
<seg id="208">You see these patients all the time.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is a force that supports you.</seg>
<seg id="210">When сдаешься, condition can deteriorate very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham went to the cost of the operation in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">By the end of August he finished last of six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">The scan showed no trace of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had a scan in March [2014].</seg>
<seg id="215">There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I just had to come.</seg>
<seg id="217">This is not a threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="218">This is the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="219">And again the cost went through six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now there is no trace of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="221">However, this process is both physically and emotionally heavy.</seg>
<seg id="222">You can think about practical things - about finances, and when I die, for example, or about the need to show his wife, works as a timer on a big PRB.</seg>
<seg id="223">When you get bad news, you become безрадостным.</seg>
<seg id="224">You need to look forward.</seg>

<seg id="227">It's hard to understand, what to say and how much to say.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose their leaders; protesters promise revenge</seg>
<seg id="2">China's parliament decided Sunday to not allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reforms.</seg>
<seg id="3">Such a move is likely to mark the beginning of being long protests in Hong Kong as activists have begun planning and mobilization in a matter of hours after that statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The People's Congress, in fact, communist leaders to remove all the candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's not обмануло our expectations, but still leads in rage," said legislator Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's not that Beijing had promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">They lied to the people of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defending the decision of China, Li Fey, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Congress, said that to allow national elections to Hong Kong's leader would be too "erratic behavior."</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing promised to allow residents of the region by voting to choose the head of the government, starting in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chinese leaders have taken the decision as a democratic step forward, since it gives a direct vote гонконгцам right; however, the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold in his hands with the assistance of the Commission for nominating candidates, rigidly controlled from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, according to a new article that only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision was taken after the summer, when there have been some of the most large-scale and received wide coverage of protests in Hong Kong for many years.</seg>
<seg id="14">For a large part of the campaign after the movement in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, which threatened to cut off the financial district in Hong Kong if Beijing does not guarantee of universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday evening, after a few hours after the declaration, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central gathered in the rain to Hong Kong government headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="16">The organizers of the demonstration said that their movement is shifting to a new phase of civil disobedience and that they rise to waves of protest in the next few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, they have not reported the details, obviously, to avoid problems with state authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In онлайн-заявлении organizers reported that movement "for the central district of обдумывало capture only as exceptional measures, actions that can be taken only if all the possibilities of the dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We regret to inform you that today, all possibilities have been exhausted and the seizure of the central district of dialogue will take place.</seg>
<seg id="20">Authorities in Hong Kong were preparing to Beijing a few days, and on Sunday the government had strengthened security measures involving police and barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">The unrest is the feeling of many in Hong Kong, they slowly lose control over their own city.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">As well as increasing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying that his demonstration to jeopardize the businesses - the lifeblood of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protest, which they say, it could lead to a big economic damage, depending on how many people will participate, and for how long," said lawmaker Regina Yip, who has long been critical of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="26">We do not want to spread concern about the fact that Hong Kong is out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This view, which is harmful for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chinese state media also gave reports in recent days, in which Hong Kong activists of the democratic movement were shown диверсантами considering Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral law, which drew tripped over one fifth of Hong Kong voters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists are raising the question of race and the behaviour of the police after Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">Unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Фергюсоне, Missouri, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">Coming raise their hands, chanting: "Hands up, don't стреляй", while they are waiting in a queue before burial.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Missouri, Фергюсоне, associated with the murder of teenager Michael Brown, change blogger Miriam зоила Perez noticed the shift in интернет-разговоре among white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">In her experience, the white feminists, stamps, comments: "Gender" above race, when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, as tensions grew in the Midwest and attracted national attention, Peres saw the white women who is 100 percent focused on the race.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared with the reaction of black women shortly after the killing on 9 August, personal essays with such titles as "thoughts about Фергюсоне from white women" and "Феминизм is not only about the example of women" came relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Perez, they demonstrated a significant shift.</seg>
<seg id="9">"In feminism, I do not think that there are a lot of people who talk about the white color of the skin, and was on such a high level," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People feel the need to say something about what has happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is a very symbolic for the crisis with which we are faced, and because of the situation in Фергюсоне) is so tied to race, they feel that at this point.</seg>
<seg id="12">For Professor of English at the University of Ohio Кориты Mitchell Ferguson has laid bare problems that blacks face every day, but one which is not perceived as a "women's problems" in the cultural sphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can write something funny on Facebook about what was going on with me and my partner, and get 150 лайков from everywhere," says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">When I write something about how the colored people are attacked in his own country, clearly the silence.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Why are women so to speak publicly about the relationship, but not about the security in the public sector?" She asks.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women, like Mitchell, who studied the issues of race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between matters relating to race and gender.</seg>
<seg id="17">From her point of view, blacks, women are in a position to clearly separate the problems; they are faced with a complex reality every day.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women now bring together issues of race and gender in feminist мейнстриме, Энджела Хэттери, a professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that its predecessor did.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 1865 and 1890 линчевали for years, at least 10,000 black men, and the ground is almost always served as the rape of white women," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="20">A white woman, was the story to justify линчевание.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the point of view of Хэттери, the gap between white and black women, while white суфражистки, for example, Susan B. Anthony looked at the situation in the late 1800s, and saw that the fight for suffrage will be effective only for one of the groups: Women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They decided to lay all the eggs in the basket of voting rights for women, and the right to vote for blacks would appear later," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="23">To look back on things like this gives us a clear idea of why colored women don't trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have not done anything good.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to white women united against mob lynchings in the South for the women to prevent mob lynchings.</seg>
<seg id="27">This group is almost 40 years after blacks for the first time women have asked for help, "said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">From the point of view of Mitchell, the reactions of white feminists on the issues raised in the conduct of the police, "Фергюсоне, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white a feminist had to" catch up "problems that blacks women cope in several generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It is true, it would be fine, if female, which have such a [traditional феминистическая] ideology, would seriously to raise a child, as they relate to the right to contraception?" Asked Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="30">The second wave feminists who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to контрацептивам, now are beginning to understand what that means.</seg>
<seg id="31">Known white феминистического movement activist Gloria Стайнем through two weeks after the killing of Michael Brown took Фейсбуком and published a sharp колумнистки Rebecca Carroll, Guardian article which claimed that white Americans took more participation in protests on issues of racism.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope that women who have a similar, but there is another reason to understand the danger of the body," and the point of view of the racial problems that are substantially different in surveys of the public - will be at the head of the change, "wrote Стайнем.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Стайнем guarantee for more пересекающийся feminism that involves issues of race, gender, and her comments about race in America is still startling to some.</seg>
<seg id="34">Researcher Christina Соммерс American entrepreneurial Institute, is the author of "Who stole feminism?," she said She The People that young men in the United States, especially young people of color, "are much more vulnerable than their sisters," but Стайнем Фергюсоне contradict the negative criticism, which she previously clear.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for the boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">But when the White House recently initiated a program, "Сторож my brother," to help the vulnerable black and mortgage young men, followed the US changed remarkably from the many feminists, including Gloria Стайнем.</seg>
<seg id="37">Police relationship with the black community is not the only problem, продвигающая helm of traditional feminism.</seg>
<seg id="38">After U.S. immigration officials arrested around 63000 unaccompanied minors at the southwestern border of the country this year, immigration reform came to the surface again, this time as a women's problem.</seg>
<seg id="39">Andrea Меркадо, co-chair of a singularly ineffective policy, the organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to make this issue as important for women, it was just to share stories of immigrant women.</seg>
<seg id="40">"They speak for themselves," said Меркадо.</seg>
<seg id="41">When the vast majority of work visas are issued [иммигрантам-мужчинам], women who come to them are in position, vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="42">"These stories are responses from women's organizations," she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric vehicle market</seg>
<seg id="2">This week the Ministry of Economic Development will make the government a comprehensive plan for the development of clean vehicles in Russia, told the deputy director of the Department of the Ministry of Oleg Плужников round table that held the newspaper Vedomosti declared in Moscow - 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">The plan drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals - reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is expected that the document will be passed in late September, early October, "says Плужников, the proposed measures concerning the development of hybrids and electric vehicles - plan to газомоторном fuel in Russia already have.</seg>
<seg id="5">The plan (a copy of the Vedomosti is designed for 2014-2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">To develop the criteria for the evaluation of electrical and hybrid vehicles, and to decide how to promote the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">The government report, which will be described in the tax and customs support measures for years, will be prepared by December 2014; the concessional lending and leasing will grace by April 2015, and the proposal to reduce prices, stimulate and create a service infrastructure will be developed by 2015</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014-2015, is expected to make changes to regulations to ease conditions for the construction of the infrastructure charge (parking, petrol stations etc.).</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, federal officials plan for 2015 to formulate proposals for regional authorities, as well as to promote the use of clean transport - in the form of advantages in the movement and parking, for example; and by February 2016 and the expansion of government purchases of such transport.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, the Ministry of Economic Development by October 2014) in the list of indicators in assessing the performance of regional authorities, reflecting the effectiveness of the support for the production of clean transport, the development of the infrastructure charge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Electric vehicle market in Russia, while only formed in 2013 across the country sold about 100 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the beginning of the 2014 обнулена an import duty on electric cars, so sales will be approximately 500 pieces, predicts, Chief Executive Officer of Russia, Andrey Mitsubishi Motors in 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="13">But Baltsi growth does not make any noticeable: Electric cars in Russia in 2013, according to the Association of European Businesses, sold 2,78 million cars and light commercial vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="14">While electric cars in Russia imports only Mitsubishi Motors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Start import preparing Renault - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says director for strategic planning and partnerships in Russia Renault Ремиз Nicolas.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most of the other manufacturers of electric transport took in relation to Russia is taking a wait-and-see approach.</seg>
<seg id="17">The development of electric cars have and Russian manufacturers "", "," given by GAZ CEO, "but the trivial.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in January - July 2014, according to the "АСМ-холдинга," Avtovaz released 30.</seg>
<seg id="19">Demand due to modest cost, admits director of AvtoVAZ engineering Sergei Аманов, without state support will not be a breakthrough in this segment.</seg>
<seg id="20">The development of the Russian market in addition to the cost of electric cars (those electric cars that are sold in Russia, on average, twice as much as analogues with internal combustion engines) is an underdeveloped infrastructure charge (retails sites - units), "sighs CEO Автостата Sergei Целиков."</seg>
<seg id="21">Because of the cost and the low pace of reducing the cost of electric cars in the next 3-4 years remain нишевым segment of the Russian market, "said chief editor Mikhail Авторевю Подорожанский Целиков, agrees with him.</seg>
<seg id="22">Car manufacturers, in contrast, say that some models of electric vehicle is already close to the value of the ordinary.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Russian market between good prospects, the important thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "real" электромобильность; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of the new charging stations, the group president of BMW's Wolfgang Шлимме.</seg>
<seg id="24">Such implementing infrastructure projects, for example, in "Россети:" In Moscow, several stations, soon will be around 80.</seg>
<seg id="25">Talks about building a network of retails sites is underway and with other regions.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to the director of the department "Россетей" Vladimir Софьина, the company believes the market is ready to build electric and gas stations across the country, but there are problems: A small number of electric vehicle in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging different brands.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, "Россети" as network the company does not have the right to engage in the sale of electricity, to do this in relation to charging.</seg>
<seg id="28">His wife believes the most effective measure in support of Russia's electric vehicle market progeSOFT customs duties.</seg>
<seg id="29">Zero rate will act before the end of 2014, its renewal and expansion of the preferential list.</seg>
<seg id="30">The transportation tax to environmental (the idea is being discussed and concerns all cars) also support the market, but not as noticeably as customs preferences, for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="31">Tax in Russia is relatively small, said Pankov, unlike, for example, from Norway, where the reduced tax rate led to a sharp increase in electric sales - now they account for 12% of the market.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia we need and not for stimulus measures, such as free parking in the centre of town (as it has done in Moscow), I am sure Pankov, or any of the electric vehicle movement of dedicated lanes, which in Russia.</seg>

<seg id="7">The weakening of the ruble is long-term in nature and, in tandem with the euro, and in tandem with the U.S. dollar.</seg>
<seg id="8">The long-term forecast assumed that mark, "says senior analyst at Alpari Anna Бодрова." "</seg>
<seg id="9">All of that has to do with Ukraine, one way or another will be reflected on the courses.</seg>
<seg id="10">As long as this continues, investors will react.</seg>

<seg id="13">This week, according to forecasts, will be closed around these levels - 36,90 37,05 and dollar.</seg>
<seg id="14">The tax period ended, oil prices, weak policies, sanctions, the issue of gas transit through Ukraine are all links in the same chain.</seg>

<seg id="16">Soon, the same end, seasonal vegetables and fruits, and there will be a vacuum, so long as the other переориентируются network of suppliers.</seg>

<seg id="18">Still, will look at whether to impose sanctions on Saturday promised, as will meet NATO.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to him, the ruble weakened sharply after the tax season, then went to the news on Ukraine, the Central Bank said last week that, until the end of the year to a fully floating exchange rate and refuses any currency interventions.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you look at the daytime wobble, it is no different from the previous ones during this month, all have spooked the mark in 37 rubles, "continued the analyst.</seg>
<seg id="21">And so, in terms of turnover - nothing has happened.</seg>
<seg id="22">Worrying times for the currency market, I would like to remind you, when at the end of January was an increased demand for the currency, as well as a third of March, when the Central Bank отгрузил a record number of currency.</seg>
<seg id="23">In UFS IC and see the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="24">First of all, it is the growth of revenue from the export operations, as well as to increase the competitiveness of domestic manufacturers at the expense of more expensive imports, says chief analyst UFS IC Alexei Kozlov.</seg>
<seg id="25">Negative moments can be attributed to the price of imported goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of the investment in the Russian economy, growing inflationary pressure and, as a consequence, are the cause of more expensive borrowing money, which, in turn, slows down the development of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you talk about the stock market, the rouble devaluation smoothes over a decline in stock prices, expressed in roubles.</seg>
<seg id="28">For example, the MICEX index during trading Thursday fell 1.67%, and the RTS Index lost 3.27 percent.</seg>
<seg id="29">Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of reduction of indices due to the weakening of the ruble during the day more than 1.5%.</seg>
<seg id="30">The weakening of the ruble is an emotional character and can be explained by a desire to buy the currency.</seg>
<seg id="31">In practice, gradually emotions go to, and quotes the ruble partially or fully restore lost ground.</seg>
<seg id="32">"We believe, soon we will be able to see the value of the dollar and the Russian currency is near the level of 36 rubles to the dollar," said Alexei Kozlov.</seg>

<seg id="2">Восстанавливающаяся economy means more customers, the more sales and jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Account for taxes at the state and local level for companies across the country, moderately increased in the last year, which accelerated the recovery, according to a new study, published last week, and the company in the Washington area is no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion in the coffers of the state and local level in fiscal 2013, to 3.8 percent more than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tax burden on business in the state and local level in the past year, rose 4.3 percent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after dating each other years, when accounts declined in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">Taxes, rose 4.3 percent, faster than the local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to the research, which was conducted by providing professional services, Ernst & Young and the Center on taxation, the tax policy.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the tax revenue in the county, 56 percent, in taxes on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of tax revenue for Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the amount of tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="10">To a large extent, is caused by the growth of tax revenues return to the same level of the value of real estate companies, the researchers say, that raised property taxes by 3.7 per cent this year, after three years in a row, when growth was less than 1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large proportion of those earnings in larger states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same thing is happening in the Washington area.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion property taxes at the state and local level in the past year, to $9.6 billion more than in 2012 - growth at 4.2 per cent, compared with the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the return of the value of the property does not have a similar effect on the growth of tax revenue for the state and local level in Maryland, where property taxes barely exceed one-fifth of companies' tax bills.</seg>
<seg id="14">Virginia and the District of Columbia pay tax accounts for about half of the state and local level, in the form of taxes on real estate.</seg>
<seg id="15">"What is happening in Maryland is that such a large part of their real estate tax base, especially around the District of Columbia belongs to either the government or the nonprofit organization, which does not pay property taxes," said Douglas Линдхолм, executive director of the Center on taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, Maryland forced to rely much more on personal income taxes, for example, to pay for those services that exist in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent increase in tax receipts from businesses cannot fully explain the recovery of the real estate market.</seg>
<seg id="18">Income entrepreneurs also, it seems, is on the mend, according to this data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Chinese companies may increasingly raise capital in the company's corporate income tax on the state level, in the amount of $2.3 billion to $2.1 billion more than in 2012.</seg>

<seg id="2">The group's debut album Royal Blood - the new hope of British rock, выведшей рок-дуэты from clubs straight to the stadiums.</seg>
<seg id="3">The duo Royal Blood all year on the stage, but already has the music prize nomination for the BBC, in the opening round of the Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the New York concert from the doorframe Пейджа Jimmy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Their debut album is still several months before release received 100 thousand предзаказов contract, and the issue lies in the portfolio will Warner Music.</seg>
<seg id="5">Given the present situation on the market плачевную, lambasted the situation, because it is not about the new Lana del Ray, or another сладкоголосом representative of a "new R 'n' B ', and about the appearance of the British duo быковатых, playing with the level of volume and intensity, that the last time was in a couple of decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">In general, rates on the first album in connection with all вышеозначенными circumstances were especially high, and is hollow.</seg>
<seg id="7">The duo took their name not in vain, that this could prejudice that isn't quite so desperate and hairy metallers, which flows the blood of kings, how they think, they have in the veins, too.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is, of course, primarily about the heroes of the past of Led Zeppelin, and the great quartet, Royal Blood aim to shake застоявшуюся blood British rock, taken it to a new level.</seg>
<seg id="9">To make predictions about the success of this enterprise until, perhaps, thought to say something, but you can.</seg>
<seg id="10">A dozen songs, with a small уложившихся in thirty minutes - it's not so much the phenomenal композиторского gifts, many move and a powerful statement of intent.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some of the dignity of the individual, of course, cannot be denied: A pilot say, single "Out of the Black" has been characterized by the fact that the south is not melodic line, and drum.</seg>
<seg id="12">Musicians in a joke that this song in general easier настучать than напеть.</seg>
<seg id="13">It is also a powerful "Little Monster" and will record the song "Better Strangers" with шекспировской quote in the title.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the truth is that each of these songs would sound great at a party of heavy rock, but when playing in a row they merge into a more or less uniform canvas.</seg>
<seg id="15">And that's not necessarily bad, on the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="16">The strength of the Royal Blood in that they do not claim the new Lennon and McCartney (rather too mark in successors Motörhead), but many of the ghetto рок-дуэты инди-клубов.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their music, despite some variety, created for stadiums, in the room, less than a couple of thousand people, she is obviously closely.</seg>
<seg id="18">The secret is partly in хитром use of bass, guitar took the usual format, thought at the beginning of the zero The Kicks.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, it is not only in Spain, but also in the approach to writing songs.</seg>
<seg id="20">Heroes ретророка zero with great difficulty mistakenly beyond postmodern paradigm, with great reluctance, went on to admit themselves not just эпигонами, and independent creative units.</seg>
<seg id="21">Royal Blood, now sound so heavily and the subsequent pressure that this successfully драпирует some вторичность твердолобость and musical material.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cunning ways to save on university textbooks</seg>
<seg id="2">The fact that the cost of university textbooks for many students more than $1000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move to the second course, came up with an ingenious way to reduce costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">He has developed a system, how to take a book from старшекурсников, offering them rated compensation that they delayed their sale.</seg>
<seg id="4">"My textbook on mathematical analysis, which usually costs $180 for the semester, I got $10 and biscuits" Chick-fil-A "," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying in Ковенант College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The literature on the cost would be $430 last semester, he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He spent $120.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the Council, the average college student spends $1,200 a year on books and supplies, but the students have a number of options to reduce these costs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Students increasingly choose online stores and creative ideas, such as the system of Schroeder ’ s leadership.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rent a book becomes more popular, allowing students to use the book for the semester, and often is significantly cheaper than buying them.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Нибо Инкорпорейтид", which holds more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of rental books grew by half since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">Industry studies show that about a quarter of books in university bookstores during the past spring semester were taken, said the vice president "Нибо" Trevor Meyer.</seg>

<seg id="13">Here's introductory course on the best ways to make a deal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Buying online store</seg>
<seg id="15">Sometimes, if you'll come out in the Internet, the price of a new book may be one third from the one that you'll see in the university bookstore.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" Ron Larson ’ s Bruce Edwards and Robert Хостетлера worth about $290 privately, but a copy can be purchased for $239,99 site Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Buying a used</seg>
<seg id="18">If you don't mind other people's notes or damage, second-hand textbooks is a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Mathematical analysis" sold for $93,49 подержанном form on to Chegg.com.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Кэсэдей, 25, a fourth year student at the University of Бригэм Young, said that paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for the textbook in strategic decisions in the media: Understanding of the business side of the advertising business. "</seg>
<seg id="21">The book sold for $48.</seg>
<seg id="22">Teachers, for example, the Ingrid Брейси, director of "College without walls" at the University of Massachusetts in Эмхерсте, offers students refine their professors, could use the previous editions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates are insignificant for classes.</seg>
<seg id="24">In such cases, the old editions can often be found for a very small proportion of the cost of the latest edition.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition to websites Amazon and Chegg, Half.com, "owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying second-hand books.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hire</seg>
<seg id="27">About to rent textbooks, you need to think, if you are well enough with them, don't forget to return them and don't want to leave them himself, after the course is completed.</seg>
<seg id="28">You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, a student could rent "Математический analysis" for a semester for about $20.</seg>
<seg id="30">Find out the rules of the store, where you take the books, including any fines that you can write the notes, and damage.</seg>
<seg id="31">If you take a book, remember: If you do not вернете book, fines may even exceed the cost of the new instance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Electronic books</seg>
<seg id="33">Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks is another option.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sometimes such books actually take rent, buying electronic license for a certain period for retailers, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.</seg>
<seg id="35">Hire "Mathematical analysis" on the site Chegg.com for six months will cost about $61.</seg>
<seg id="36">Брейси says that students who study literature, can often find the most advantageous prices, as many classic works now, you can download for free, while the literature on natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.</seg>
<seg id="37">Despite that, осмотритесь.</seg>
<seg id="38">Joe reports, 29, who is going to start their studies in high school, and recommends that you use Пеппердин ISBN number for the book, as it ensures that you are looking for is the right to text.</seg>
<seg id="39">But before you order online, reports said, be sure to check whether a book is in stock.</seg>
<seg id="40">To him this lesson Hemsedal is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="41">The book, which he bought, was postponed for four weeks, and, in the end, he paid the full price at the university bookstore.</seg>

<seg id="39">Санкционное menu</seg>
<seg id="40">On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of specific economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which is basically food sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="41">The country banned import of beef, pork, meat and offal names from poultry, meat, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cheese, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausage and sugar syrups.</seg>
<seg id="42">The restaurants began jockeying seems with suppliers: Prices of products grown, you must urgently seek counterparts from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="43">This will affect the most expensive restaurants with монокухней France, Italy, Spain, in which products supplied directly from the "maternal" countries.</seg>
<seg id="44">Общепиту was carrying before.</seg>
<seg id="45">For example, when, at the beginning of 2014, the Rosselkhoznadzor banned the importation of Australian beef, and the year before - the American and Canadian meat.</seg>
<seg id="46">In return, the suppliers have supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="47">But sanctions лета-2014 were far more serious.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the president's decree, which lifted the ban on Atlantic salmon and trout fry безлактозное, milk, seed potatoes, corn, peas and onions сахарную for replanting.</seg>
<seg id="49">The Italian transfer hopes that sanctions may even смягчиться.</seg>
<seg id="50">As part of the restaurants, there is the uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="51">According to the company, "East-West", one of the largest suppliers of imported products in the HoReCa, the share of the premium segment accounted for up to 70%.</seg>
<seg id="52">"Expensive restaurants to change menu under the produce of local farmers and other countries," says Sergei Mironov, industry, owner of the agency "Рестконсалт."</seg>
<seg id="53">If a chef, for him it's not going to be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="54">But we have very little such chefs, and for the development of a new menu can take two or three months.</seg>
<seg id="55">From the restaurant Brasserie Тригель "The Bridge" will have to be prepared to give up: From 10-15%, still half the menu, recycle.</seg>
<seg id="56">In restaurants with a kitchen are starting to replace dishes, for example steak from the marble beef - on бефстроганов, says Sergei Mironov.</seg>
<seg id="57">"Cheeses from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian cheeses and cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," lists the "East-West" Oksana Глибчук.</seg>
<seg id="58">Cream and milk products from Europe have counterparts in Russia and Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="59">Chicken from the United States may be replaced by chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and семга from Norway, salmon, семгой, those from Belarus and Chile.</seg>
<seg id="60">The lack of fruits and vegetables of European production may be at the expense of domestic production, the proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.</seg>
<seg id="61">According to Mironov, budget restaurants road network will be easier than премиальному segment: It is unlikely that there were able to distinguish between the Italian 16-year-old моцареллу from the Russian.</seg>
<seg id="62">Although it is difficult to have to establishments Ginza Project, he says.</seg>
<seg id="63">The Ginza Project a few dozen restaurants under different brands and with their menu.</seg>
<seg id="64">The replacement will take plenty of time, "said Mironov.</seg>
<seg id="65">In Ginza refused to comment, citing the absence of owners in the country.</seg>
<seg id="66">The owners of the Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine stress that products from the former Soviet republics ароматнее European</seg>
<seg id="67">But a lot of restaurants, and that sanctions are not affected.</seg>
<seg id="68">These include schools with kitchen CIS: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.</seg>
<seg id="69">"The Georgian kitchen no expensive products," says Хатуна Колбая Saperavi, owner of the Georgian restaurants and cafes "Vai мэ!."</seg>
<seg id="70">All cheeses for us to do in Russia, the basis of many dishes - chicken, exotic herbs we don't use. "</seg>
<seg id="71">In Колбаи establishments until removed from the menu of a single cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="72">Timur colon, owner of the restaurants "high-born N1" with Uzbek cuisine, sanctions also might alert: He will have to change not only the Norwegian in New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="73">If Russia our owned imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we even win in price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="74">From the CIS can be cheaper to get to engineering, Norwegian, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that brought from Central Asia, much better than the "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="76">The Uzbek tomatoes all know that they are delicious, sweet.</seg>
<seg id="77">The Spanish, no one says so.</seg>

<seg id="79">About its intention to replace the European imports in Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions said Belarus and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="80">Restaurants now that responded to a query, "" Money, "and also quite calmly respond to sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="81">The McDonald's said that localization exceeds 85% and the network is working with 160 Russian suppliers.</seg>

<seg id="9">The parameters laid out in the draft guidelines, and are designed to eliminate this obstacle in the way of implementing "европротокола" in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to them, the maximum payout has in connection with the accident, without the police, must not be lower than the limit for "европротоколу."</seg>
<seg id="11">But at the same time, she can't be above a certain limit, the treaty has insurance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The idea, of course, useful and theoretically capable of relieving both its employees and the road.</seg>
<seg id="13">But, more likely, it will not delight in neither motorists nor insurers.</seg>
<seg id="14">The last now talk about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which could lead to the introduction of new rules on payments has.</seg>
<seg id="15">As for the drivers, it is difficult to imagine what kind of work will have to be done to overcome исконный Russian conservatism.</seg>
<seg id="16">In most cases, the driver would be hours to wait for the inspectors to make small accident, because the lock.</seg>
<seg id="17">And it is still unknown, that will be easier to win - or to convince drivers swindlers in reliability "европротокола."</seg>
<seg id="18">Savings certificate will be registered and безотзывным</seg>
<seg id="19">The Finance Ministry wants to block savings certificates to the bearer, but will allow banks to make their analogue безотзывного contribution.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Finance Ministry is preparing a bill that would prohibit savings certificates to the bearer.</seg>
<seg id="21">In recent years, this tool is gaining popularity, as rates here are higher than on bank deposits.</seg>
<seg id="22">The fact is that savings certificates to the bearer not the bank deposit insurance system, and they cost less, because they don't have to make payments to the Fund Deposit Insurance Agency (pointed out).</seg>
<seg id="23">Successfully situation, that this step will be taken because of the small and medium-sized banks, spreading such certificates, and suffer from Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which, according to the pointed, control 98% of the level of the market.</seg>
<seg id="24">And the share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, is about 3.5%.</seg>
<seg id="25">The problem, explains pointed out, is that a small bank customers, who bought such a certificate, in case of withdrawal of the license is trying to get money in pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some investors, who do not have sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates to the bearer, may assume that their investment is insured.</seg>
<seg id="27">The absence of reasonable insurance payments on these certificated in case of license revocation the bank can lead to misunderstandings and social tensions.</seg>
<seg id="28">In cases when the agency had tried to seek insurance certificate holders предъявительских redress through the court, "he said in a pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="29">The problem, of course, made-up.</seg>
<seg id="30">The certificates pay buyers still nobody will, because under the law they have no right to compensation from the State.</seg>
<seg id="31">If the case was that the tool is not insured in pointed, together with him would be banned and metal, which means citizens are in grams of one of the four metals: Gold, silver, platinum and palladium.</seg>
<seg id="32">Since these accounts do not end up in a system of deposit insurance, but their existence as long as no one deprives.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is likely that the bearer certificates are very comfortable, which actually can act in the role of квазиденег.</seg>
<seg id="34">The move is virtually out of control: The bank can buy a certificate to any citizen, and to putting this certificate can change a lot of owners.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is not by chance that the draft that savings certificate must be issued, which must be stored in depositories.</seg>
<seg id="36">And the cash in such certificates пилюлю banks allowed to issue without the right to early repayment.</seg>
<seg id="37">That is a similar безотзывного contribution, which has long been a dream of the bankers.</seg>

<seg id="1">Met two Union</seg>
<seg id="2">The talks at the highest level in Minsk is not decided, for the sake of which were called back, but gave rise to a new format: The first face of the European Union met with the chief executives of the Eurasian future</seg>
<seg id="3">And on occasion, the situation around Ukraine тревожному (very urgent does not tolerate), the leaders of the EU and Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of "hot issues."</seg>
<seg id="4">It is capable of such a structure to work effectively, it is not clear; but it is clear who took the cream from that summit.</seg>
<seg id="5">Questions on this one evening on August 26, when the Belarusians, and followed them and other евразийцы with Europeans see increase in new President Lukashenko.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Belarusian leader revealed an example of polished учтивости, this was the behaviour of a man who had just caught the cosmetics industry - and is planning a decent old age in society.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Maidan Lukashenko helped</seg>
<seg id="8">The arrival of the three main European commissioners (of the EU), who met with Mr. Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf - not just the president with легитимация 20-years experience.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is an application for the recognition or full of European policy, and the campaign of the Ukrainian crisis.</seg>
<seg id="10">A senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Studies Denis Мельянцов sure: From Brussels would not have to talk with Minsk in the same tone as before.</seg>
<seg id="11">"What Catherine Ashton met face to face with Lukashenko, gives reason to believe that the relationship with the EU will be размораживаться and beyond," he said "Огоньку."</seg>
<seg id="12">This is the hidden part of the iceberg: The breakthrough the Belarusian authorities began long before November Maidan in Kiev - summer 2013-го.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The results have been achieved and the EU is the successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues about modernization," lists of Ogonyok which interlocutor, "and with the United States held talks on international security.</seg>
<seg id="14">The United States was even a little bit of sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="15">As regards the Ukrainian events, they themselves and their reaction to the Belarus leadership only invoked another influx of this process.</seg>
<seg id="16">Minsk, on the one hand, managed to preserve relations with Ukraine are warm, not much to lose in mutual trade, and a President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for talks.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other, the leader of the Senate, which has not recognized the annexation of Crimea by Russia and urged to punish pro-Russian militia in the Donbas with the severity, and quarreled with Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="18">Minsk has not released any of the Customs Union, nor from the Collective Security Treaty Organization, and in October is the Russian air base.</seg>
<seg id="19">Brussels and Washington have a balanced position of Minsk to the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated her, believe the experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">How successful will the movement's political economy, will be seen by how often the Minsk should ever take meetings in the format of the EU + TC.</seg>
<seg id="21">The press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy Catherine Ashton and diplomacy have failed to answer questions about what Brussels wants from the relationship in a new format.</seg>
<seg id="22">A spokesman for Ashton said only "Mayan Косьянчич Огоньку" that decisions on issues of war and peace, this issue is not a priority.</seg>
<seg id="23">While there were reports that following a meeting on the Ukraine issue, with the participation of the people in the new format may be, and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="24">A drop of tar in Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that on this, as it turns out, personally asked the representatives of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, at the final briefing Alexander Lukashenko made it clear: All sides are not against that Minsk has remained the central platform for meetings in Россия--ОБСЕ--Украина format, and at the level of heads of states and representatives of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="26">This means that "the last dictator in Europe" quite рукопожатного acquires the status of European leader that helps to solve a global problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">The European farmer's best friend</seg>
<seg id="28">Already the EU delegation included еврокомиссаров on trade and energy, pushed to the conclusion: The main underlying reason for the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbas, and economy.</seg>
<seg id="29">In fact, сверстанное meeting schedule future talks on the supply of gas and to overcome fear of the CU in the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU looks like achievement more extensive than peace declaration without specific dates and numbers.</seg>
<seg id="30">Trade Commissioner Karl De Гюхт, nevertheless, indicates EU representatives: "Arrived in Minsk to seek a political solution to the crisis, which has economic consequences, and not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="31">It seems, however, that the economy and the crisis in Ukraine "works" in Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its consequences - and above all reciprocal sanctions from the West and Russia - give Minsk, who himself is under pressure, while санкционное with room for maneuver.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to the leader of the Mises Research Centre, the presidents of Belarus Yaroslav Ramanchuk, European investors are actively interested in opportunities for agricultural supplies to Belarus in the Russian Federation in bypassing sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="34">The supply of this scheme, for which President Vladimir Putin at the summit пожурил Minsk.</seg>
<seg id="35">"By these schemes," said Romanchuk Огоньку "," are not the Belarusian businessmen and Russian companies.</seg>
<seg id="36">They worked for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes were destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Russian business is in desperate need to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of the Belarusian authorities.</seg>
<seg id="38">The second story, "the expert continues," is linked to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are away to Belarus from the raw materials to the Russian market.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Ukrainian producers about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and the Belarusian производственно-торговые scheme now could be very popular. "</seg>
<seg id="40">According to Ramanchuk, the role of the host site for the negotiations, the EU and the TC is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of the development of economic ties with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="41">He recalls that the loss of the agricultural sector of the EU sanctions against Moscow are estimated at 10 billion euros, and the Commission is currently proposed аграриям only 125 million euros compensation.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Belarusian president could offer to Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for еврофермеров.</seg>
<seg id="43">This can raise the authority of Lukashenko to the EU at an altitude.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hospitality without initiatives</seg>
<seg id="45">Catherine Ashton, the Belarusian authorities have thanked the initiative for the summit.</seg>
<seg id="46">But the paradox is that the Minsk from his active role in the birth of the format of the CU + открещивается, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with Ukrainian counterpart emphasized that the initiator of a new format and it was.</seg>
<seg id="47">"It was your suggestion to come, without any навала discuss, not with бухты-барахты decide, after the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU, to sort out the situation, which at that time was in Ukraine," he said in front of cameras to Peter Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, observers interpreted it as an attempt to calm Moscow, it was rumored, was initially against the mediation, which greatly increases his political weight.</seg>
<seg id="49">In Belarusian diplomatic establishment carefully emphasize that cooperation between the EU and Belarus in the TC did not pursue a lucrative goals, and the ultimate goal of this format in the future - the creation of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.</seg>
<seg id="50">"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts which, in other areas, in particular in the field of security, puts and promotes the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation," said "Огоньку" in Belarus, the Foreign Office, where in the last time words were chosen very carefully.</seg>

<seg id="3">His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later discloses that Putin had in mind the hint that восточноукраинская territory under the control of separatists will become part of Russia, but that her status within Ukraine should be revised to give русскоговорящему region to defend their rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, Mr Putin's call for the Government to start negotiations with the very insurgents as government-controlled with equal with obvious strategy, which he should be from the start of the bloodshed five months ago, to help bring the separatists and the Ukrainian government to force новопровозглашенной Новороссии of de facto independence, to closer ties with Russia rather than with the West.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with state television First Channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return the territory in the eastern separatists retained Donetsk and Lugansk regions, which were seized in March and April, after Moscow be much stricter in Europe the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.</seg>

<seg id="7">Putin has said that anyone who believes that peace talks will occur in the near future, when the Ukrainian politicians to campaign for parliamentary elections on October 26, and while government troops attack peaceful settlements of the separatist held regions - "illusions," Itar-Tass reported's a prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We must immediately begin substantive talks and not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the public status of Southeast Ukraine, in order to serve the interests of the people living there," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskov said that Putin's words about the state had in mind in the context of the broader autonomy that was discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to allay fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and language rights at risk.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian government could give the eastern regions more autonomy, Peskov said.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is not a matter for discussion between Russia and Ukraine, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and an internal Ukrainian conflict."</seg>
<seg id="12">Spokesman for the Kremlin's intervention to rectify incorrect "interpretation of the words" Putin stressed the decision of the Russian leadership to behave in relation to the separatist rebellion in the east in any other way than to open the seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the population is ethnic Russians 2-миллионного.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow had to withstand much more heavy battle to attach even Луганскую area of eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and, as the majority of the 6.5 million residents are Russians, and polls before the start of the conflict, showed broad support for the desire to stay within Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">Autonomy, which Russian diplomats discussed at international forums gave regional governments in the Ukraine power themselves to trade agreements and foreign policy, in effect giving the Kremlin the actual control over the territory, which would be combined with the situation in the territory of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Black Sea peninsula, присоединенном five months ago, is the Russian military fleet, as well as commercial marine institutions and historical sea resorts.</seg>

<seg id="19">Last call for Putin to Kiev to negotiate with the leaders of the separatists, as with equal, followed by new наступлениями rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks rolled into previously peaceful areas of the eastern Ukraine along the Azov Sea.</seg>
<seg id="20">Russia has supported separatists took control of the city in which Новоазовск officers of the Ukrainian security services say they are afraid that he is beginning a campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory to the Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="21">This led to a large-scale civilian and military efforts to strengthen when the port of Mariupol, with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Новоазовском and narrow on the Crimean peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko on Saturday addressed the meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which was independent of 23 years.</seg>

<seg id="2">Сердитое expression is biologically universal for mankind, and everyone involved in its creation, the body and muscles is significant, and is an additional means of expressing power and threat, researchers have found in Australia and the US.</seg>
