<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have offered the bill, on which the trade unions is a civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">"where trade unions that are there and the jobs of the middle class," says Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, who is the co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive factions.</seg>
<seg id="4">That's why I proudly represent Act expanding workers' rights, together with the symbol of the movement for civil rights by John Lewis.</seg>
<seg id="5">This bill will give workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination against organizations, trade unions, and other forms of discrimination, bringing to power foes of trade unions</seg>
<seg id="6">Changing the law on regulation of labour relations in such a way as to allow the workers encountering discrimination for participating in organizations, trade unions, to seek justice in the civil courts "and to receive compensation for damages and punitive payments - a sensible and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it's certainly not radical initiative - at least by American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the best way to understand the fact that offer Ellison, Lewis and co-authors of the bill, "recall is a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the attacks, which the unions have been subjected in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country, Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, to expand and to respect human rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time, which is still remembered by millions of Americans, when this country simultaneously defend democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas MacArthur and his assistants have helped the country to adopt a constitution, so as to ensure that balanced state autocracy Хидеки Тодзё was replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included text that explicitly admitted that "the right of workers to organize and to negotiate, and for collective action is guaranteed."</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Эйзенхауер and his assistants have helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that the fascism of Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recognizing that workers will need to be organized and be heard in the new state, the Germans have included an article that openly stated: "right to form associations with the aim to protect and improve employment and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict or seek to diminish that right, will have no legal force; measures to these objectives will be deemed illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">When former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was president of the International Commission on Human Rights, which was World Declaration on Human Rights, which in 1948, will be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the added that "everyone has the right to organize and join unions to protect their interests."</seg>
<seg id="17">Generations of Americans take for granted our basic position that labor rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country was advised by other countries about how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans have explained that the right to organize labor unions - and the fact that this union has participated as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - should be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now, when these rights are under assault in America, wise, indeed, return to the American ideal of what working people should have the right to organize and to ensure that their voices were heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:</seg>
<seg id="21">History is a great teacher.</seg>

<seg id="23">Raising the living standards of millions, unions miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to fragile level of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack the unions, forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.</seg>
<seg id="25">History remembers should and to us.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the U.S., a federal judge on Sunday temporarily has blocked the enactment of the law in Louisiana, which his supporters say he likely will close all five абортных clinics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to this measure, which was signed by the Governor of Louisiana Bobby Джинадлом in June and was supposed to go into effect September 1, doctors who do abortions, were obliged to have showing a radius of 30 miles of their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nevertheless, the judge's decision means that, at present, doctors can continue to make legal abortion, while continuing to seek such powers.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally, continuing actions to gain power," he wrote in his decision, Judge John деГрэвеллз.</seg>
<seg id="6">A hearing will be scheduled within the next month, at which a judge will take a more permanent solution on this law.</seg>
<seg id="7">The defenders of the right to abortion with joy were met by this decision, the latest in a chain of decisions against similar measures, saying it will give doctors more time to receive hospital authority.</seg>
<seg id="8">"today's decision ensures that the women of Louisiana will be protected from one law which seeks to deprive them of the health and human rights," said Nancy Нортап, president and head of the Center for reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the five clinics.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the decision to the doctors from two clinics that do not give claimants in the case, and also filed an application for the admission.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of the 11 states that have adopted similar laws, and the courts recently acknowledged such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="11">Key parts of texas law, which closed would have the majority of the remaining clinics in this state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fighters for the right to abortion, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association say that the laws on the powers of impose on doctors, restrictions are not necessary from the medical point of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, though some also pointed to positive effect in the closing clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only one doctor who does abortions in Louisiana, there are powers of the reception in the hospital, according to the Center for reproductive Rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all the other doctors in the state will be forced to stop performing the procedure, the doctor, fearing for their safety, could no longer perform the procedure, told the group.</seg>
<seg id="16">Criticizing the decision, officials in Louisiana said that will not punish doctors doing abortions as long as their statements on the reception awaiting decisions.</seg>

<seg id="1">What will the introduction of quotas for domestic products</seg>
<seg id="2">Not less than half of products for each type of product in the range trading networks should be the Russian production, says Duma deputy from A Just Russia, Oleg Nilov has informed about.</seg>
<seg id="3">The MP has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures for domestic manufacturers, writes the newspaper Izvestia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The document will still детализироваться, in order to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.</seg>
<seg id="5">This applies to goods that are produced in Russia. <... > According to the rest of the groups of products, which are produced in Russia, Vester will provide at least half of their shelves to domestic producers, "Nilov has informed about publication.</seg>
<seg id="6">Together with the amendments, in the article "On the basis of state regulation of trading activities in the Russian Federation," the bill provides for the introduction of changes to the Tax Code, laying down religious rate VAT 10% for products produced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea to introduce a 50% -процентную quota in retail networks included in the stimulus package for Russian producers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The shop appears several times more than domestic goods.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the initiative may have both positive and negative effects, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the lawyer the company "Налоговик", a member of an independent expert center "Public Duma Sergei Litvinenko for the Russian economy, as well as for domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive in nature, and will lead to growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">The advantage will be key, farmers, and small shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">They will be able to sell more, and that means that profits will grow.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, they will receive the right to dictate retailers their conditions and prices, because they will be forced to buy their goods.</seg>
<seg id="14">Russian manufacturers will be able to increase their business and sales, which would lead to pay higher taxes than before.</seg>
<seg id="15">It will increase revenue, create new jobs, any industry will grow any faster in, be made to contribute to the growth of GDP.</seg>
<seg id="16">Russia's dependence on foreign food fall a few times, but not immediately, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="17">Earlier, Russian companies are often unable to fight their way to the shelves of local stores due to higher competition from foreign counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche freed and can breathe a sigh of relief.</seg>
<seg id="19">But do not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary inspections to the Russian market will come grocery goods from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="20">In other words, it is now a "moment of calm" when former players have already gone, but new ones yet to come.</seg>
<seg id="21">After almost a month, you can talk about four demand for Russian raw materials, as well as rising prices for finished products, "said АиФ.ru first Vice President of Russian public institutions," the Russian club finance directors', Tamara Kasyanov.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clearly, the idea of selling in each category at least 50 per cent of Russian food products will help to consolidate the sector for local producers.</seg>
<seg id="23">In that case, they will have to compete with one another, not with products, through subsidies of another State, are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="24">In other words, the fight for customers will unfold between companies, working on a single law industry.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, says Kasyanov, Russian producers are able to meet 50% of domestic needs compatriots not on all items.</seg>
<seg id="26">And in this situation commercial networks will have "дотягивать" share of Russian goods up to half of the range.</seg>
<seg id="27">In this regard, increasing fears that the price will come substandard goods.</seg>
<seg id="28">Perhaps under the guise of manufactured in Russia, will be delivered to foreign products with перебитыми labels, "adds an expert.</seg>
<seg id="29">The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will feel the large retail chains, especially those that выгодней cooperate with importers.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is logical that the former prime minister will suffer and foreign suppliers, because the demand for their products will decrease.</seg>
<seg id="31">Litvinenko did not rule out that the law on quotas on domestic goods may impact on consumers.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fact is that some of the products produced in Russia may yield in the quality of imported ones, while shops will be boosting prices on the second as a scarce commodity.</seg>
<seg id="33">The long-forgotten early in the 2000s, the idea of import substitution economists again spoke in February this year because of the ongoing devaluation of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="34">Now, amid the uneasy relations with the West, the question of refusal to the import of products becomes even more urgent.</seg>
<seg id="35">The law aims to compel retailers under orders to suppliers reckon with domestic producers.</seg>
<seg id="36">Then we are much faster and more confident we will go on the path of import substitution, and the planning system of production on necessary types of products will be created in a shorter period of time, "says the MP Oleg Nilov has informed about.</seg>
<seg id="37">Especially effective mechanism of quotas will be for the agricultural sector, where the potential is particularly high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.</seg>
<seg id="38">Our farmers are able to fully cover the shelves in Russian shops.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition, a powerful impulse can receive and a beautiful production.</seg>

<seg id="2">Feel whether Russians soaring prices</seg>
<seg id="3">As a result, BNP sanctions of Russia and the West inflation in Russia will not уложится in predictions of the authorities, convinced analysts "VTB Capital."</seg>
<seg id="4">According to experts, the deferred effects антисанкций will lead to inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the latest forecast, in 2014, inflation will be 6,5-7,5% next year and even less - 6.5%.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to the newspaper, "Kommersant," this week the ministry should make a "small but significant" changes in macroeconomic forecast up to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the publication, the agency ’ s assessment of inflation in 2015, which will eliminate the expected progeSOFT personal income growth.</seg>
<seg id="8">The forecast anticipated that food sanctions Russia act a year - until August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">In such a situation, you could assume such high inflation?</seg>
<seg id="10">The current situation involves geared shock, but понижательный trend of inflation does not change, "said the source of the newspaper so far.</seg>
<seg id="11">Economists from, "VTB Capital analysts do not share expectations economic bloc governments regarding inflation and the forecast price growth in 2014 at the level of 8%.</seg>
<seg id="12">The main effect of product bans will come together with the possible introduction of the Spine sales taxes (GAP) in 2015, convinced experts.</seg>
<seg id="13">Inflationary peak at 9 per cent in February, after which the annual pace of price growth will decline, some experts believe.</seg>
<seg id="14">Incidentally, last week, Rosstat concluded the first inflation results, after Russia imposed a "neat sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="15">АиФ.ru interviewed experts and found their inflationary expectations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Artem Деев, head of research at FC AForex:</seg>
<seg id="17">Prices have already observed in key segments.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moreover, when I began to appreciate the socially relevant products, the government has been forced to launch measures of systematic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risk of unjustified price increases in the short term.</seg>
<seg id="19">Suppliers and retailers already report on a daily basis before regulators that authorities knew exactly who, where and for what reason will trigger an increase in prices.</seg>
<seg id="20">Key factors for the growth of the consumer price index continues to be tremendous pace of capital flight, and the excessive refinancing the banking sector from the Russian мегарегулятора, internal convert because of the flight of foreign currency, as well as an embargo on the import of food products from the countries that joined the sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="21">If inflationary pressures remained under control, the cost of a basket of a minimum set of products not jumped to 12 per cent in a quarter.</seg>
<seg id="22">A ban on the import of food products provoked shock proposals on the internal market and led to the utterly логичному increase the final cost.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because at this stage we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, and increase the size of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production, retaliatory sanctions continue to bear the risks to the growth of the inflationary component.</seg>
<seg id="24">If you add here yet and fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as ухудшенными prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year, inflation could exceed 8%.</seg>
<seg id="25">Alexander Разуваев, director of the analytical department "Alpari."</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 1990s, inflation sometimes hit 20-30 per cent per month in zero she was also higher than current levels, another thing that then it is offset by rapid economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="27">I think, at the end of the year inflation will be 8-8,5%.</seg>
<seg id="28">Plato Магута, managing assets of the Fund Магута "</seg>
<seg id="29">An external factor associated with sanctions against Russia, while successfully contained, but if there is a further increase of the pressure, first and foremost, for the financial sector - this can lead to certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations, which traditionally occur in purchases of currency to protect their savings.</seg>
<seg id="30">It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance will mitigate the gradual weakening of the ruble, as market practices and government regulation.</seg>
<seg id="31">But the rise in prices begins traditionally after the summer lull, and perhaps this fall will become more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="32">The target level of consumer inflation in Russia at 7.5%, most likely выстоит, as Russia has another financial savings.</seg>

<seg id="14">Both told the "RSL" head of a construction company "Профи-инвест Anatoly Демьянко, estimated regulations is long out of date, but another mechanism businesses unless invited.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as far as the proposed settlements for the constructive elements, but in practice this is implementable, because the building has often used different technologies," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is no secret that стройрынок developed largely thanks to госзаказу.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the Chairman of the Management Board of the NP "Экспертное community professionals procurement" Catherine Лезиной, today, the state is the most effective customer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Deputy director of the pharmaceutical industry centre of capital construction, Rosatom Vladimir Malakhov drew attention to the fact that today's market is nominally divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and the company that owns outsourced competence and does not allow for this field of competitors.</seg>
<seg id="19">He believes that the creation of a transparent market is only possible when access to contracts will make Turkey from someone's manager.</seg>
<seg id="20">The expert council was asked to form a government in such a way that one and the same performer may not receive more than one contract worth more than $1 billion rubles, or several contracts worth more than $1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="21">In минстрое believe that this approach must be evaluated from the point of view of the business impact, and effectiveness of construction management.</seg>
<seg id="22">As explained by Elena Zhukova, in this case, you will need to delegate the function of general contractor that will lead to an increase in the number of customer and budgetary expenditure on its content.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the same time, the customer will need to have the knowledge to assess the quality of its contractors, as well as their safety.</seg>
<seg id="24">Often, in this 1.13 will need to determine who will be responsible for the security of an object as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of qualified participants in the state in connection with drogerie in receipt of public order for part-time work and a small amount of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="26">Deputy head экспертно-консультационного Center Institute of Procurement Alexander Евсташенков believes that right now, the government has turned to business to Scor contractor.</seg>
<seg id="27">And gave this example: "a participant when completing the application must indicate" specific performance "without specifying the words" or equivalent "," should "," "," "more," "less than," "similar" "or", "type", "a similar type," "lower," "lower," "higher," "can," "may," "might," "earlier" and "not previously," "higher," "not allowed" and so on.</seg>
<seg id="28">Thus, customers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of applications of contractors.</seg>
<seg id="29">Another problem 44-ФЗ, according to Евсташенкова, was the need to assess the application of quality of work through the "paper" proposal.</seg>
<seg id="30">When an attendee, really can be assessed only qualified contractors, but not the quality of the work, in which not even began, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="31">The quality of the works can be assessed only on their acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="32">The expert council also was asked to take a margin income from the upper to the lower echelon that disappeared intermediate contractors.</seg>
<seg id="33">Chairman of the Expert Council, State Secretary, espionage FAS Andrew Цариковский believes that it should not, as responsible for the order should генподрядчик.</seg>
<seg id="34">But otherwise, as in the famous репризе Arkady Raikin normalises sleeping: "пуговицам claims there?."</seg>

<seg id="2">In the former home of gold and горнозаводчиков Евдокима and his son Ivan Демидова on the street of the October Revolution 57 / 1 (former Big Kazan) 18 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="3">The house of the 18th century, since the building has not changed, if not considered ветхость.</seg>
<seg id="4">People out here, like on the tour, and tenants more suffering than rejoice, from his privilege - the right to live in the 7th Ufa house whose walls recall commander Alexander Suvorov.</seg>
<seg id="5">Date buildings house amongst others, historians point to the two dates - 1730 and 1737 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in any case, it turns out that the nearly 300 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The old yard, always open the door, squeaky staircase.</seg>
<seg id="8">Doors in the apartments are located near each other, the chair covers were cracked, and in просветы from peeling plaster seats visible street.</seg>
<seg id="9">It seems that everything rests on honest word.</seg>
<seg id="10">But local residents are told: "you don't think it is."</seg>
<seg id="11">Live in a wooden house of the 18th century, it is very difficult, "says Tatiana (1961, a resident of apartment # 3.</seg>
<seg id="12">The object is on госохране, but money for its content is not allocated tens of years, and we feel museum artifacts, about whom the authorities simply forgot.</seg>
<seg id="13">The last renovation was 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The wall even though with great difficulties performing well, but the foundation of the entire прогнил.</seg>
<seg id="15">Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, and higher once a week in a public bath.</seg>
<seg id="16">How can we be satisfied in such conditions?</seg>
<seg id="17">The road passes directly under the windows, even a pedestrian zone.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tatiana will put off behind.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now see what before was only heard: under the windows of the rushes the flow of cars.</seg>
<seg id="20">You see, glass дребезжат constantly, with the windows open can't, and the noise are accustomed.</seg>
<seg id="21">The man as to the outcome, for good and bad.</seg>
<seg id="22">Our apartment is still a top, thanks to her husband, hands him gold.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, two of the rooms we have, and live together with her son.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for other families, the conditions are much worse on the second floor at all was a little more than one and a half metres tall.</seg>
<seg id="25">In contrast to Tatiana invites the guests to the roommate out of the apartment, No. 6 Lyudmila Старостиной.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nice friendly woman with threshold offers up a cup of coffee and with a sad smile said:</seg>
<seg id="27">We have a one-bedroom apartment, 14.5 m ² on the four people and live with her husband and daughter with his granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="28">I am here with the birth, another boundary has never been seen before, "Lyudmila обводит eyes room: you're buying two couch the letter" g "; one of them was the granddaughter with a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="29">Very closely and differs little from a domestic interior: only ceilings beautiful, "historical."</seg>
<seg id="30">But with the ceiling regularly flows: tap system for good.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lyudmila said about his apartment routinely and amazing at the same time, as an Italian, the house which stands on the Roman ruins.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is the one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:</seg>
<seg id="33">Water spent about 40 years ago during the last repair.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the same time have made us a small kitchen in закутке and toilet from former чулана.</seg>
<seg id="35">We live in a time where квартировал Demidov family, on the second floor were servants.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our apartment is privatized, and why?</seg>
<seg id="37">In real estate, so they say, privatization does not matter.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still get only a one-bedroom apartment can't apply for more.</seg>
<seg id="39">Already four months ago promised us расселить, but promises it won't matter.</seg>
<seg id="40">Not used to complain and I will not.</seg>
<seg id="41">In this apartment (bedroom!) lived for an entire dynasty: my grandparents, Mom and Dad, I'm with my husband and my daughter with his granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="42">Things happened during that time.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, здоровенные rats ran in the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="44">Look at the walls, they one-meter wide thickness.</seg>
<seg id="45">They say that a solution was involved in eggs, so long rests.</seg>
<seg id="46">House built thoroughly, thank Демидовым!</seg>
<seg id="47">Perhaps, but so far no one killed crumbling ceiling or сваей.</seg>
<seg id="48">Only construction still slowly dying there in his eyes: the board and log house гниют, floors have repeatedly failed, pouring cement, but all of it - the solution goes into the ground, as well.</seg>
<seg id="49">They say, and is under our bathroom the concealed лаз and move to the river White, who had once lived here there had to be protected from the danger, in which case.</seg>
<seg id="50">They also pursued.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lyudmila Starostina, tells how it came some historian, pleaded to let that he started in the flat excavations.</seg>
<seg id="52">And then urged to give them housing space in exchange for its однушку in October.</seg>
<seg id="53">Lyudmila historian refused:</seg>
<seg id="54">Where do we daily in однушку?</seg>
<seg id="55">But here at least a tiny hope is that will give housing more spacious.</seg>
<seg id="56">"do you not agree that we on the exchange, would not have won.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, the family Старостиных nothing and not won.</seg>
<seg id="58">The biggest dream of Lyudmila to расселили, and daughter with one 16-year-old his granddaughter gave a separate room.</seg>
<seg id="59">Then there are the two families have identified two-room apartment instead of the majestic ruins, in which two generations living now.</seg>
<seg id="60">Pretty, миниатюрная girl Olesya Карсакова from world No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.</seg>
<seg id="61">In two cramped squeezed totaling 23 m ², called apartments, lives with her large family.</seg>
<seg id="62">Altogether seven people, two of them.</seg>
<seg id="63">See for yourself what conditions.</seg>
<seg id="64">Plaster butt falls off with pieces, like window frames, the walls in the kitchen, and the cross-cutting holes.</seg>
<seg id="65">The water in the кране all year just cold.</seg>
<seg id="66">Walking about the apartments of the old home, you can be sure that the most fortunate spouses Лаврентьевым from apartment No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="67">They occupy the most spacious rooms of the first floor.</seg>
<seg id="68">You're right, places a lot!</seg>
<seg id="69">The 75 square, directed three people.</seg>
<seg id="70">We live in those rooms, where legend has it stopped police during his stay in Ufa, says head of the family of Aleksandr Dmitrievich Lavrentyev.</seg>
<seg id="71">Ceilings are high, spacious.</seg>
<seg id="72">One bad - all around the train wreck, falling apart, collapsing.</seg>
<seg id="73">Neighbors probably already told.</seg>
<seg id="74">The torment we have with the sexes: wooden boards сгнили, the earth literally walked out of the legs.</seg>
<seg id="75">I put подпорки, wedges; in the hall still nothing, and in another room walk, both on a seesaw качаемся, so all you can.</seg>
<seg id="76">The house merchant Евдокима Демидова Aleksandr Dmitrievich can tell you better than any guide.</seg>
<seg id="77">The золотопромышленнику refers to the native, speaks of it with admiration.</seg>
<seg id="78">Indeed, the personality was fantastic: host Кагинского and Узянского plants built houses, отливал guns and bells, kept Ural mines.</seg>
<seg id="79">Heirs merchants estate forefathers proud, but live under one roof with history no longer want.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am settled here, even as a child, in the 1940s, of the 20th century, "said Aleksandr Dmitrievich.</seg>
<seg id="81">Then around stood wooden room and barn and sentry boxes, subsequently снесенные.</seg>
<seg id="82">In 1968, wanted to remove, and our home, but something prevented.</seg>
<seg id="83">Later in 2014: again поманили new housing.</seg>
<seg id="84">We, as a team, and gathered all the paperwork, обегали necessary resort, and suddenly learned that moving to an apartment in 2015 or 2016.</seg>
<seg id="85">Something already doesn't believe in all this.</seg>
<seg id="86">Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan, to learn the fate of their homes.</seg>
<seg id="87">Officials of the occupier was not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="88">Sent from one desk to another, but then, as mockery, given the paper without the signature and seal: "the Ministry of Culture is not objecting to resettlement tenants."</seg>
<seg id="89">I have even a feeling that our house has long been not in terms of the city since he first was at number 57, then became 57 A, now 57 / 1.</seg>
<seg id="90">As if he had been demolished in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="91">"a planet" urged the head of sector informational-analytical work managing the land commission be Vladimir Барабашу.</seg>
<seg id="92">A house on the street of the October Revolution 57 / 1 is included in the resettlement of old housing.</seg>
<seg id="93">I cannot answer for the actions of the officials in the 1970s, only know that at the time there was a plan for demolition of old homes, despite the historical significance.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the authorities is to rebuild the old house on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value, is successfully implemented.</seg>
<seg id="95">Tenants soon planned расселить on new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="96">According to Барабаша, restore House Демидова are Italian specialists who have participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="97">Now in Italy passes architectural exhibitions, and the "Old Ufa" presented there, among others.</seg>
<seg id="98">I hope that by 2016 all former Old short street will telephone, "said the official.</seg>
<seg id="99">Home purchase order, a fact that was earlier, three centuries ago.</seg>
<seg id="100">House Демидова, is likely to become a museum, open to all comers.</seg>
<seg id="101">In addition, the government decided to make the street over the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="102">On weekdays, unfortunately, does not work, is too much workload of roads in the city.</seg>
<seg id="103">Расселить people from the future museum Vladimir Barabas promises in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="104">However, it is unlikely they will be: their new apartments will be of the same area, and that the current.</seg>
<seg id="105">Only from another era.</seg>

<seg id="2">Never say, "I love you"</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was one of seven children born to a family of immigrants from Jamaica in Dudley in Мидлендс in 1958.</seg>
<seg id="4">His father, who died when Henry was 19, he worked in a factory, and their relationship has been limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry репетирует comedy, "Rare records Rudi," which is partially based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of programmes on Radio 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mix of 199.4 and rap, and melodies - жизнерадостны.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Henry had to wading through some difficult memories of childhood.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the death of his mother was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often mused about the relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was very inaccessible.</seg>
<seg id="10">You never saw his face, you've only heard his voice: "don't make noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Отстань dated sisters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Шевелись!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch the cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were older, when I was a child, walked with him in the pub and talk about these things, as a form of beer glasses, the beauty of the strike in Plus.</seg>
<seg id="15">I've never been with him not speaking.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was such a неулыбчивым guy in the corner, which was a big part of my life.</seg>
<seg id="17">Recently, Henry discovered are studio in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in the days of his father, he was able to take a look at what must have been his life.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now there's a little bit better, but it's dark, дымные, depth of labyrinths' full extent of Hell with outbreaks of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father залезал in the bathtub and just lay there, and you have heard, as he slowly begins to sing about himself, because he wanted the отмыться from 02 shop.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I came back, I realised that he was doing this for years and years, to earn money for food, and I began to appreciate it more.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nevertheless, Henry came from a childhood devoid of parental love.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never cuddled, never said, "I love you."</seg>
<seg id="23">Only when her mother became ill at the very end of her life, we started to talk: "I love you, I love you, I love you.</seg>
<seg id="24">The birth of her own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love with which he lacked as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">You can stop it, "I love you"?</seg>
<seg id="26">Just don't hug me!</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I'm 22!</seg>
<seg id="28">With Dawn French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why me along with her, not to make friends?</seg>
<seg id="30">She's a great mother</seg>
<seg id="31">They are still great friends with the French, to whom he was married for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="32">Don is a good man.</seg>

<seg id="35">The mother of Henry had diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="36">He was the one that killed her.</seg>
<seg id="37">So, when I was very, very recovered and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take drastic measures.</seg>
<seg id="38">Then I began serious training фитенсом, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It's very hard.</seg>
<seg id="40">And that's boring.</seg>
<seg id="41">Nobody eats carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">A change of career trajectories of Henry reflected, perhaps, in his noble, briefly подстриженной beard.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he received the recognition of critics for his Othello, he completely immersed in theatre.</seg>
<seg id="44">Followed "Комедия mistakes," and then "hotel" Огаста Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">This work is different from sitcoms and comedies that were неотъемлимым attribute his busy professional life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He started his career, when he was 16 and worked in a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">DJ remarked as he parodies on the stage, and wrote about it in "The new faces."</seg>
<seg id="48">His career in television began in the mid seventies: "quite a long time I was the only black пародистом / first on television."</seg>
<seg id="49">He was learning on the job.</seg>
<seg id="50">I not only had to grow in the eyes of the public, I had to learn how to be an effective vehicle for delivering jokes between 1975 and 1985, as a star, working on television, and it was very hard.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny in the 'New faces "in 1975</seg>
<seg id="52">As his manager had the right to "Black and white show minstrels," light entertainment program, in which people "чернили themselves face," Henry found out what is in it for five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">My family is a very disliked.</seg>
<seg id="54">I was, like, I wish that this had never happened to me, but I don't regret that I did it.</seg>
<seg id="55">Although it was strange, worthy of condemnation position, I worked on large venues and learned to work with a crowd.</seg>
<seg id="56">But what was "which received awards light entertainment classics on British television for years and years," was "grotesque to black people."</seg>

<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">It seemed that they were waiting for a disaster, but it has not happened.</seg>
<seg id="75">Soon we began "Комедию mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I was at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you have changed."</seg>
<seg id="78">A technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the audience.</seg>
<seg id="79">"the Pacific voice inside me said: 'you have to work 10 minutes until they чинят computer.'"</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead, assistant director announced that view will resume as soon as the problem will be solved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I walked away from the scene and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."</seg>
<seg id="82">It's not my responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can't let someone else deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="84">"you're playing in, stay in the role."</seg>

<seg id="93">By the way, Henry is still thinking comic - all the way our conversation перебивают flashes his humor, when he then starts, it finishes to parody.</seg>
<seg id="94">I just decided not to work in стендапе because this thing with the instant gratification of a full room of strangers, I think, quite dangerous.</seg>

<seg id="101">I like to be an actor.</seg>
<seg id="102">It's pretty fun.</seg>

<seg id="2">They weirdest thing about, the best way to say it, they gradually разваливались, like a cardboard box that was left in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="3">But sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, hard to communicate, tense, and maybe a little раздражительный.</seg>
<seg id="4">And then she пожимала his hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">He saw in his irritability.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was колючим like hair, yes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The last victim of this колючести was little novel, from which he waited longer than usual, lonely and boring life, and perhaps even some satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Эйлинн Соломонз was pulsating fragile beautiful with взлохмаченными hair and трепещущим heart of northern island village, even more remote and harsh than Port Ройбен.</seg>
<seg id="9">She came to the south with master older than himself, whom Кеверн believed her aunt, while the latter has inherited a house in crude, but like Paradise Valley under the joyful called Райская Valley. "</seg>
<seg id="10">No one lived in the house for several years.</seg>
<seg id="11">The pipes were trickling in defence were sitting motionless spiders, слизни left their footprints on all the windows, confident that the house belongs to them; garden зарос weeds like giant кочаны cabbage.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was like a cottage from children ’ s books, simultaneously terrifying and wonderful, full of secrets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Opinion of the author: Howard Джейкобсон, whose novel "J" included лонг-лист Букеровской premiums in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">The shortlist will be announced next week</seg>
<seg id="15">Кеверн and Эйлинн sat, holding hands, in a broken industry among the high grass, enjoying surprisingly warm spring day; they both absentmindedly to cheap consoles, which provided with country appeasing music and 3-zmianowy news, when, glancing at her crossed brown legs, he remembered the old song long forgotten black performer, whom he loved listening to his father, the curtains in the house.</seg>
<seg id="16">You have a very big feet.</seg>
<seg id="17">In view of the inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type on the console will no longer lost.</seg>
<seg id="18">They were not banned - nothing actually was not forbidden, just more of them is not lost.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have become архаичными, as the word "archaic."</seg>
<seg id="20">Public taste did what would never have succeeded in orders and regulations, as well as among the books people chose memoirs rich, staying in poverty, cookbooks and love the novels, of all the music they chose ballads.</seg>
<seg id="21">Happens this afternoon, Кеверн began playing the ideation piano and rough comic voice singing great legs Эйлинн.</seg>
<seg id="22">Эйлинн not understood.</seg>
<seg id="23">"it was a popular if jazz pianist named Фэтс Уоллер", he told her, mechanically to his lips, two fingers.</seg>
<seg id="24">So did his father to stop the letter "J" before she power immediately from his lips.</seg>
<seg id="25">It started with the game, in which they played when he was little.</seg>
<seg id="26">His father played in it with his father, as he told him.</seg>
<seg id="27">Start the word with "J", forgetting put over his mouth two fingers, "and it will cost you a penny.</seg>
<seg id="28">It was not very fun back then, and it was not very fun right now.</seg>
<seg id="29">He knew that from him, wait, that's all.</seg>
<seg id="30">He had to explain what is jazz.</seg>
<seg id="31">Эйлинн never heard.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jazz is playing, even though he was not explicitly prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="33">Improvisation went out of fashion.</seg>
<seg id="34">In life, there was only one "if."</seg>
<seg id="35">When the music started, people wanted to know exactly where it will end.</seg>
<seg id="36">With wit in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="37">His unpredictability had people on the nerves.</seg>
<seg id="38">But jazz was wit, marked with the help of music.</seg>
<seg id="39">Although he has reached the age of 10 years, never слышав about Sammy Дэвисе Младшем, Кеверн knew about jazz from paternal полусекретной коллеции CDs.</seg>
<seg id="40">But at least he did not have to speak Эйлинн that Фэтс Уоллер was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">Given her age, it is unlikely she remembered a time when popular singers were not black.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again, there are no laws or pressure.</seg>
<seg id="43">Society was docile, and this meant that every segment of the agreed with gratitude - the gratitude of those spared the fate, "with the principle of group predispositions.</seg>
<seg id="44">People афро-карибского origin in temperament and physical characteristics are suitable for areas of entertainment and sport - and they were singing and ran.</seg>
<seg id="45">Natives Индостана, as if by nature talented in everything that concerned electronics, the fact that no family is left without a working electronic phone.</seg>
<seg id="46">What is left of the Polish diaspora, substitutes works; what is left of the Greek, should have a plate.</seg>
<seg id="47">Originating from the Persian Gulf and the bank, whose grandfathers were rapidly leave the country when THEN, WHAT happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened happened, in fear that they were accused of inciting the flames, in fear, in fact, that the fire consumes their following, have opened restaurants with лабне and get, not dropping and yearned from leisure.</seg>
<seg id="48">Each according to his abilities.</seg>
<seg id="49">As she had heard only ballads, Эйлинн was difficult to understand how offensive the word, who had just sung her Кеверн, could be laid on music.</seg>
<seg id="50">Music is an expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">"they didn't really offensive," said Кеверн.</seg>
<seg id="52">Except, maybe, for people who have great legs.</seg>
<seg id="53">My father have never offended, but he loved this song.</seg>
<seg id="54">He said too much, but launched a garden gave him the illusion of security.</seg>
<seg id="55">No word could not penetrate the US giant leaves similar to капустные.</seg>
<seg id="56">Эйлинн still did not understand.</seg>
<seg id="57">Like your father could love this?</seg>
<seg id="58">He wanted to say that it was a joke, but he did not wish for her again, eases to the lips, two fingers.</seg>
<seg id="59">She already thought it strange.</seg>
<seg id="60">"it was funny," he said instead.</seg>
<seg id="61">She недоверчиво shook her head, closed Кеверну review.</seg>
<seg id="62">The whole world was nothing but копны her иссиня-черных hair.</seg>
<seg id="63">Nothing, that he would like to watch.</seg>
<seg id="64">"well, if you say," she said, in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="65">But that still doesn't explain why you're me her sing.</seg>
<seg id="66">She seemed really upset.</seg>
<seg id="67">I have too big feet?</seg>
<seg id="68">He looked at them again.</seg>
<seg id="69">You cannot say no.</seg>
<seg id="70">Ankles, maybe a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="71">And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?</seg>
<seg id="72">I hate you?</seg>
<seg id="73">Of course, I don't hate.</seg>
<seg id="74">It's just this stupid song.</seg>
<seg id="75">He could say: "I love you," but it was too early.</seg>
<seg id="76">"I like you very much because you have thick ankles", tried to say he instead.</seg>
<seg id="77">I have such a distortion.</seg>
<seg id="78">It was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="79">He wanted me to this was ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="80">Attempts by the joke often led him into awkward situation, because, like his father, he was missing the soothing charm that could mitigate the cruelty, крывшуюся in whole or in part.</seg>
<seg id="81">Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.</seg>
<seg id="82">Maybe he, Кеверн, wanted.</seg>
<seg id="83">Despite the good eye.</seg>
<seg id="84">Эйлинн Соломонз flushed and stood up with the lounger, the oldies on the console and the wine that they drank.</seg>
<seg id="85">Wine from the referendum, so that drugs could not serve as his excuse.</seg>
<seg id="86">In his excitement, it seemed, was trembling, like living beings leaves in the weather system.</seg>
<seg id="87">"and you, I like you very much because you have a pointless head," she said.</seg>
<seg id="88">Though not like you very much.</seg>
<seg id="89">He felt sorry for her and because of the excessive brutality of his words, and because of fear, who appeared in her eyes when she gave him the state.</seg>
<seg id="90">Was it that he had it hit?</seg>
<seg id="91">She has not talked to him about life on the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he has no doubt that the main traits she was similar to здешнюю.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same huge icy ocean struck on both of them.</seg>
<seg id="93">Those same American pilots could reflect with men, even more sensitive and accused after THAT happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened than their ancestors, the smugglers and разрушители, shopped in fury from pub to pub, ready to raise a hand on any woman, посмевшую deny them or поддразнить them.</seg>
<seg id="94">Pointless head?</seg>
<seg id="95">They would have shown her a fist, if she was not cautious.</seg>
<seg id="96">First would be kissed, kiss now became the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; an antidote from fresh ballads, too, which provide proper console - the first kiss her, and then hit.</seg>
<seg id="97">Excessive clarification, according to Кеверна because the kiss itself was already хулиганством.</seg>
<seg id="98">Эйлинн Соломонз case showed that he needs to leave.</seg>
<seg id="99">He rose from the lounger, like an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She herself felt the lead weight, but the weight of his grief surprised her.</seg>
<seg id="101">This was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They barely knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">She looked, as he goes, and out of an upper window looked, as he leaves, her companion, the man himself взваливший themselves to others.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam, outgoing garden, thought she was.</seg>
<seg id="105">She felt a stab of sympathy towards him and men in general, even though some of them and raised her hand.</seg>
<seg id="106">A man, отвернувшийся from it, with the pulpit, пристыженный, slain, the ability to fight left him - why she felt she knew so well, if she could not recall a single occasion, until today, when she saw this?</seg>
<seg id="107">Again one Эйлинн Соломонз looked at their feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">For twenty years prior to the above events or so Esme cantered Нуссбаум, intelligent and energetic 32-летняя исследовательница who worked in "Офнау", an informal service control over Community mood, has prepared a report on the low and medium levels of violence in most parts of the country, where it was expected that it will be reduced, if not over entirely, given the means and the forces that were allocated to its eradication.</seg>
<seg id="109">"a lot has been done, and a lot is being done," she wrote, "to ease the innate aggressiveness of people who fought in a war and won most of them, especially among these спутанных branches and narrow расселин area, where, despite Centigrade over изгородями spires of churches, gentle breath of human kindness rarely has been felt in the whole of history.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, some quality, it turns out, неискоренимы.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher the spire, it would seem, the низменнее those passions that he зарождает.</seg>
<seg id="112">The population of sheds tears over sentimental skipping, drinking stories about преодоленных obstacles and announces its overheated belief in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness retains its strong grip as in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is evidence that the emerging new and vile задиристость in homes, in the workplace, on roads and even in playgrounds.</seg>
<seg id="113">"you have досадная habit of writing too much," said her supervisor, having read the report as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="114">It seems to me that you should read shorter novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">Esme cantered Нуссбаум lowered his head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask you: you атеистка?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I think that is not obliged to answer," said Esme cantered Нуссбаум.</seg>
<seg id="118">Are you gay?</seg>
<seg id="119">Esme cantered again insisted on his right to privacy and silence.</seg>
<seg id="120">Feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Again, silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I ask," finally said Luther Рабиновиц, "not because I am against atheism, лесбийства or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">Here we have no prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="124">We are the servants of society without prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="125">But some kinds of hypersensitivity, absolutely reasonable and a good in themselves, they may sometimes distort the results, such as those that you showed me.</seg>
<seg id="126">It is obvious that you yourself предубеждены against the church, and what you call "malevolent" and "rude", others would be interpreted as an expression of natural healthy and intensity.</seg>
<seg id="127">Continue нудеть about BUT THAT happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened, as if it happened, if it happened yesterday, it means depriving the country needed her life force.</seg>
<seg id="128">Esme cantered Нуссбаум огляделась on both sides until Рабиновиц said.</seg>
<seg id="129">Over his head, pink as gimmicks and LED letters repeated advice that "Офнау" gave the country the last quarter of a century or more.</seg>
<seg id="130">Улыбайся with his neighbour, the value of his wife, listen, go on demonstrations, talk on the phone, communicate, объясняй, listen, соглашайся, извиняйся.</seg>
<seg id="131">The conversation is better than silence, word of the song better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I fully understand that you want to say," quietly replied Esme cantered Нуссбаум, when satisfied that her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I don't want to say anything, except that we're not излечились as efficiently as we convince ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">My concern is that unless we are ready, we will find that repeat mistakes that initially led to ТОМУ THAT happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened.</seg>
<seg id="134">Only this time we выбросим their anger and distrust the other.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Рабиновиц joined his fingers in a sitting.</seg>
<seg id="136">That gesture was supposed to mean an infinite patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"you go too far," he said, "calling" mistakes "actions that made or not made our grandfathers.</seg>
<seg id="138">You go too far and when talking about what they threw away their "anger" and "mistrust" in the "other."</seg>
<seg id="139">In your place, people should not need since saying that, understanding the past is, by now, we're not talking about "us" and "them."</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "us" and no "other."</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of turmoil - that's all we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"for which, to be honest with ourselves," ventured into Esme cantered, "neither part of society may well justify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="143">I do not accuse.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it's bad or good, what is done is done.</seg>
<seg id="145">Then it was back then.</seg>
<seg id="146">Nothing needs to be said - and here we agree.</seg>
<seg id="147">And how does not need anyone to blame, don't need and making excuses, if that was appropriate, or if it could be something to fix.</seg>
<seg id="148">But why the past, if not to learn "</seg>
<seg id="149">Past Update to ensure that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I can add to that one word -</seg>
<seg id="151">Pyramid of Luther Рабиновица fallen apart.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I'll review your report," he said, and dismissed her.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, on the way to work, her knocked мотоциклист, who rode on the sidewalk, as described by passersby, "in a vicious rage."</seg>

<seg id="2">Output growth in the eurozone slowed to the lowest in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.</seg>
<seg id="3">The business index (PMI) of manufacturing sector growth in public fell to 50.7 in August, dropping from 51.8 in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">The value of above 50 indicates growth.</seg>
<seg id="5">New orders Barbarossa, and businesses have suffered amid growing tension between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The values were received before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The markets will be waiting with a clear plan of how to cope with recovery in the eurozone, as well as the threat of deflation, with inflation of just 0.3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is an assumption that the head of the ECB ’ s Mario Draghi announced later this week, may give further signals that he is contemplating scheme of quantitative easing in the eurozone, similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although some growth is better than just no growth, braking effect of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on producers are becoming more obvious," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at public.</seg>
<seg id="10">PMI manufacturing sector in Germany, a major trade partner of Russia in the EU, has fallen to the lowest in 11 months of 51.4.</seg>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile, the second largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.</seg>
<seg id="12">France continues to cause real concern, as well as weakening Italy from stable growth to stagnation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Signs that growth momentum faded mainly industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also adds to the confidence, "said Mr Dobson.</seg>
<seg id="14">The industry will likely still would add fuel to the fire analysts anticipating the introduction of additional monetary or tax-based incentives.</seg>
<seg id="15">One positive news was from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.</seg>
<seg id="16">Howard Арчер, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "the best that can be said about the August survey index of business activity in the manufacturing sector in the eurozone is that it shows that the sector is still growing."</seg>
<seg id="17">He added: "the eurozone is clearly finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension - particularly associated with the Russia / Ukraine, adds uncertainty still difficult conditions in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">This increasing tension, apparently hit by business - and especially on the confidence of consumers, and is likely to lead to the fact that some orders are delayed, or even cancelled, especially large orders.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said that "more and more it looks like" that the ECB, of course, will have to conduct some kind of quantitative easing, "although we suspect that it will be limited."</seg>

<seg id="79">And I can't stop feeling it.</seg>

<seg id="81">Damir grew up and became very soft and quiet as a boy, he's not an aggressive and angry.</seg>
<seg id="82">He is not looking for revenge, for example, he did not just fixed on it in this last nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not like to remember it, but they are very close with six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and burn candles there.</seg>

<seg id="85">Not slept, and his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys. Дамиру now 17, he was above me, nice, smart and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that a few hours I was so sure that he is dead and that I never see more.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I was able to recover from the explosion and rose to his feet, I огляделась, I saw hell around himself when parts of bodies were lying everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely sure that it is not possible to my little boy could survive in this hell.</seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember that I shouted at him:" Damir, come, убегай ", but again I was so sure that he was not heard.</seg>

<seg id="100">Not just one, there was the family of our relatives, but they were all killed.</seg>
<seg id="101">Only my Dima managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="102">The closer the date, the harder to think and talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="103">There is not a single day when we won't remember this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="104">We don't think that it was a long time ago, I think it was yesterday, some scenes these days every time I got in front of his eyes.</seg>

<seg id="108">I only found out that he was alive when I saw him on TV.</seg>
<seg id="109">And now even have the sculpture crying George in San Marino.</seg>
<seg id="110">George doesn't like to look at this picture, and she was hidden in the closet at home.</seg>
<seg id="111">I understand, but I also think that the photos of people from all over the world are feeling the pain.</seg>
<seg id="112">George says now: "it is important that this never happened.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I doubt that we ever learn the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">People continue to investigate this tragedy and will never learn the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">Now they are investigating the collapse of Boeings in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Whether we ever, what was it called?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world is going to something very bad.</seg>
<seg id="118">"I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, and nobody wants a war, because it is happening?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing for this pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need to have dozens of years slightly to forget her.</seg>
<seg id="121">It has affected my health, and I still made her feel.</seg>
<seg id="122">About three or four years I have nightmares because of the takeover, but now it became better.</seg>
<seg id="123">I returned to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips, how to achieve a better quality of underwater photos and videos</seg>
<seg id="2">If you want to take photos or shoot video under water in front of you a whole range of options.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is waterproof "Point and Shoot," for example, the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or экшн-камера, for example, the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I took these pictures on a family holiday with the help of several cameras, all for the price of about $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">No matter what equipment you use, the more rules you need to abide by in order to achieve the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Перепроверяйте their equipment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the case the cameras and other branches of the tightly closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, set up their camera for the type of photos or videos that you shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some of the photos and video cameras there were shooting or object type, which optimise exposure for mages underwater conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in the water, look at how deep your equipment can fall.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are aimed only at 5 feet, others - 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Look at our leadership of the buyer and the ratings of digital cameras, both for conventional and for November models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Remove a few frames - because many of them don't enclosures.</seg>
<seg id="14">"essentially" is the LCD, which lets you assign images, whereas the экшн-камер them usually don't.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have LCD, it will be difficult to see under the water, and the layout of the frame is a random process.</seg>
<seg id="16">So do a few frames.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also, if your camera has the serial shooting, which takes several shots with slightly different installations that use them.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay near the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">The amount of light is significantly reduced, the deeper you нырнете under water.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, stay near the surface, when you're shooting in a swimming pool, a river or ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">It also allows you to transmit more colour in photographs; the deeper you get, the fewer colors you'll see.</seg>
<seg id="22">Подплывайте closer to shooting.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is excellent advice for shooting on the land, but it is even more important under the water because of the mages light conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is especially important if you're shooting on экшн-камеру: this equipment often comes with a fixed, широкоугольной lens, which means that you have to get closer to shooting, if you want to fill the frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was such a man, whose force of personality could shake things around, even in such a giant organization like the National Health Service.</seg>
<seg id="2">Консультирующий anaesthetist, he has devoted his career deliverance patients from suffering sickness and remorse.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among those who spoke to him, recalls his wife, was an officer in the M16, who had to live with devastating effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that as long as Dr. passionate about being diagnosed and diseases, those being treated mostly worried about something else -- the pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, however, he appeared to those who suffer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I never felt, as usual," he wrote in May last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I found it difficult to find the strength within themselves.</seg>
<seg id="8">Struggling with symptoms similar to flu, he found that irritated reproaches his wife Джулиет.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want all happened sooner rather than later," said he.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Джулиет left for over a week, Lawson found that he is unusual and it is not clear why upset.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked a colleague to do X-rays of the chest.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks before he went skiing in Французских Alps.</seg>
<seg id="14">Results of the X-rays came.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was mesothelioma, a terminal cancer, which affects плевру, or the lining of the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="16">For most cancers it is difficult to determine an exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although some people succumb to cancer of the lung, for example, not all patients with cancer of the lung smoked.</seg>
<seg id="18">But with mesothelioma differently.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases the cause is contact with asbestos, grainy construction material, who once called a "miracle," but which, as we now know, deadly dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us mesothelioma is a disease that you don't pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos, in the end, is the material from the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in the UK since the 1960s, when these industrial ban came into force.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even when it has been used, only people from specific sectors worked in close contact with him: трубоизолировщики, builders, carpenters and workers of all computers, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">Industrial toxin from another era, he hardly seems cause for concern today.</seg>
<seg id="25">But such a calm erroneously.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it turns out, is now at the peak of the epidemic мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="27">Here from мезотелиомы kills more people than any other country on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="28">The annual death rate in about 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease than as a result of road crashes.</seg>
<seg id="29">The annual number of deaths from мезотелиомы since 1980 and projected the number of deaths in the future in the UK</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason we feel its deadly consequences right now, lies in the fact that, although the use of asbestos and it is illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), for the development of мезотелиомы go usually tens of years.</seg>
<seg id="31">And attack мезотелиомы is not limited to veterans specialties industrial construction.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was and, in many cases, remains, laid in the house where we live, where we work, schools, where we learn, and shops, where we go shopping.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention in class, the level of prosperity, profession or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">Bastions of избранности, from the fashionable London department stores to private schools, as it turned out, not salvation.</seg>
<seg id="35">Parliamentary building is riddled with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even hospitals that are meant to treat us, turned out to be reservoirs of this fatal a carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was not трубоизолировщиком.</seg>
<seg id="39">Strictly speaking, he had to think where he might have come into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he realized.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it seems that there might be a lot of asbestos in tunnels in the hospital Guy, where I spent six years on it," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">All are students, nurses, doctors and грузчики - used these тоннелями.</seg>
<seg id="43">I wonder how many of my peers expect the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">It was a question to which, unfortunately, he was able to give a partial response.</seg>
<seg id="45">"of the four doctors that we just need to be in hospital for Guy and have subsequently developed mesothelioma for the past five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I alone remained alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us expect this disease?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Лоусону was diagnosed with "mesothelioma," when he was 48 years old.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">Live so long is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty percent of patients with mesothelioma die through eight months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is always fatal.</seg>
<seg id="52">So, now, we can only repeat the question Lawson's: "how many of us expect this disease?"</seg>
<seg id="53">According to a leading expert on Kolya in Britain, Professor Джулиану Пито, most likely assume that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain should bootmaker himself will die about by people.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most now are not that would die that way.</seg>

<seg id="56">A quick review of reports from the halls of the court, where victims are often seek compensation, shows how far it has spread attack мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="57">In June, for example, Marks & Spencer acknowledged that included three Джэнис Ellen contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, departments of clothing on two sites, one of which was the store on Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs Ellen was just 18 years old when she started working at M & S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now her two children are older than 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="61">"before this happened," she says, "I have never heard of Kolya, I barely knew about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="62">Me in the head and could not have come that I was hurt.</seg>
<seg id="63">Few people really are aware of Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="64">In fact, asbestos is not one substance, and a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">They get their name from the word "асбестиформ", which means the fibrous structure, which tells them the strength and flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="66">Of those six, three were often used in construction.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotile, widely known as white asbestos, much more often than other occurs in buildings today.</seg>
<seg id="68">It has been used in roofing panels, used tile, thermal insulation pipes, boiler looks, even in brake колодках cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">He less смертелен than other forms of asbestos, but still recognised by the European Union and the World Health Organization "major source of harm health," which can lead to death.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, brown asbestos (амозит) and blue asbestos (крокидолит).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts have suggested that "there are good, though indirect reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with mesothelioma [in the UK]."</seg>
<seg id="72">An employee of the Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the main store on Oxford Street, London with</seg>
<seg id="73">Джэнис Ellen may not have thought of himself as a typical victim мезотелиомы, but work Julian Пито suggests that her story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that a "substantial percentage мезотелиом when there is no known exposure at work or at home, were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment."</seg>
<seg id="75">The bulk of this impact, he says, is "normal use and exposure to weather" in our buildings.</seg>
<seg id="76">No one, it seems, can't be sure that he is safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">The report Goddard Consulting, which was Westminster Palace, demonstrates how people, even in the heart of government, may have been exposed to unconsciously.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009, Goddard said that technical mines and pipelines for the premises of parliamentary committees were infected with asbestos, lethal fibres which could follow in the movement, something so harmless as "strong currents of air."</seg>
<seg id="79">Members of the parliament often blame the fact that they are pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that is the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="80">Although the dish on the maintenance of Parliament insisted that Westminster Palace received a "clean bill of health," and now she recognized that it is necessary to work on the £1 billion for the reconstruction of the Parliament, by upgrading electrician and removing asbestos, and that after the general election in 2015, members of Parliament, perhaps, will meet in the conference centre and their fertility rates collapse near, but not on the green benches horizon.</seg>
<seg id="81">The report Goddard said, noting that "the situation with the asbestos is not reformers in accordance with different rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">It is impossible to know whether this error management cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All I can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">One of those who could not identify their exposure to asbestos is Graham cost, general practitioner.</seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson, cost, 50 years, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I worked at the hospital, which has successfully been indicted claims associated with asbestos," he says, "But I can't prove this in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It's so hard to remember all the places where he worked, and dates.</seg>
<seg id="88">What he remembers clearly, so this day in early December 2009, when his wholly overcame something that was like the flu.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly I were shaken as.</seg>
<seg id="91">It started very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terrible.</seg>
<seg id="93">I thought that I won't be able to drive all the way to homes.</seg>
<seg id="94">As a doctor, cost knew that pain comes from, including checking for iframe loads, the membranes surrounding the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="95">However, like Джэнис Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect мезотелиому.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the end, he could not walk to work a month.</seg>
<seg id="97">7.8 doctors did x-rays chest and put плевральные катетеры to pull fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis.</seg>
<seg id="98">And yet his condition оставлось without the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">Gradually, his health has improved, and he returned to work.</seg>
<seg id="100">But from time to time, those same symptoms return, often after he engaged in sports, and he breathed heavily.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, one of the patients Dubai came to him in the office with similar symptoms, and he was later diagnosed with "mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="102">But even then the cost of not linked it with its own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">In the end, his patient was ten years older and worked with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">In this case, was obvious.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011, the state of Dubai deteriorated again, and Kazakhstan his doctor showed him the results of CT scans and x-rays to a group of experts.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, just two years later, after the cost of operations, began to feel ill, the sensor, equipped with a camera, was introduced in the cavity between the shell of his chest and shell of his lung.</seg>
<seg id="107">I'm an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I usually just go further, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="109">I'm not too upset about it, to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife, experienced.</seg>
<seg id="111">The biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that it was mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham cost: diagnosis mesothelioma</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly cost sank during a meeting with nurses Macmillan, one of which suggested he contact a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">It was then that he realised the scale of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"it turns out that asbestos was commonly used, especially in large public buildings, and where quite often there was asbestos thermal insulation systems on the planet," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, now succumb to the disease.</seg>
<seg id="117">Thus, mesothelioma now affects more young people, atypical professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous isolated the asbestos pipes in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees who were on pedestrian tunnels connecting nearby landmasses can bring together to get from one building to another (as Andrew Lawson), or eat in the basement canteens (how often did Graham cost) almost certainly really were exposed to toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">For several decades after the war, as it turns out, the hospital was a place where, in theory, pulled the life for поциентов, but of a place, which constituted a threat to life for doctors who treated.</seg>
<seg id="121">It still continues to resonate today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students set their burners Бунзена on 3rd Son</seg>
<seg id="123">And it's not just hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and мэриях because of his amazing insulating and огнестойких characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="125">Schools too.</seg>
<seg id="126">Strictly speaking, most likely, for the first time were exposed to asbestos in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="127">Nationwide, on countless lessons chemistry students set their burners Бунзена on 3rd Son.</seg>
<seg id="128">There websites, highlighting the problem of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as floor tiles or roof сараев typically contained asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"it's an industrial poison, in a huge number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson's in a case against the hospital Guy.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case, the only contact that she could remember the woman who was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So be careful, снося garden sheds.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effect of the diagnosis, when we know that the disease is incurable, is huge.</seg>
<seg id="134">"to realize it, is quite a lot of time," says Graham cost.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realised that I couldn't focus on what I'm doing.</seg>
<seg id="136">I stayed in the surgery for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I realized that I had to go and deal with them.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I could no longer meet Christmas</seg>
<seg id="139">One of the most difficult things was the transition from doctor to patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">As countless patients before him, he remembers, was confused with information that should have been taken.</seg>
<seg id="141">"it has been difficult for everyone to understand," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked his doctor" how many I have time? "</seg>
<seg id="143">Gave me about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember, as I thought, "Well, I'm not a Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's all. "</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, as it is the mechanics of how we support life, "is the act of breathing -- causes cancer, which kills.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases мезотелиомы caused by contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos is composed of tiny fibers.</seg>
<seg id="149">When asbestos is being destroyed and fiber carcinogenic, they could get stuck in плевре, shell the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="150">The fibers of asbestos irritating плевру and can cause mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the problem occurs because of breathing the needle fibers of asbestos," Professor Tom Трежер, кардиоторакальный surgeon, who came in 2001 in hospital Guy.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is the same hospital where, as suspected, Andrew Lawson, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="153">Трежер knew Lawson's and treated some of the others who, perhaps, was exposed to while in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">When иголочки asbestos into the fabric of the lungs, says Трежер, "breathing them unload on the periphery, where the shell.</seg>
<seg id="155">It is, in its essence, think the process from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="156">Conventional treatments of other forms of cancer is much less effective in Kolya.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, cause hot debate.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some think it's worth a try.</seg>
<seg id="159">Трежер disagrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">"you can't cut плевру," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">It around her region with a knife.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, the cancer is "not very well to chemotherapy," which "acts", but not people.</seg>
<seg id="163">"from time to time there are patients who live a long time," says Трежер.</seg>
<seg id="164">But ultimately, they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some patients are living much, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">Writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after he was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years after diagnosis, Graham cost continues to fight.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he became ill to mesothelioma, Dubai acquainted with Andrew Лоусоном, which, four years after the diagnosis, single-handedly turned into office support and consultation for these same patients.</seg>
<seg id="169">"yes, Раковая Central," cheerfully told it, when they called.</seg>
<seg id="170">"he was very positive," says cost.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was diagnosed with four years ago, and he still is very energetic.</seg>
<seg id="172">First Эбботту offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and prolonged his life only a month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was in despair," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, "managed to somewhat more positive agenda."</seg>
<seg id="176">Meeting with several specialists, cost decided to continue treatment with Professor Лоиком Ланж-Лаздунски, professor торакальной surgery in hospital Guy.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we had an advantage in that I don't need it, I just called them and they took me," admits Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">Consultants, the patient would have to get the direction and approval for funding.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money plays a decisive role for patients with mesothelioma, in order to get the best available treatments.</seg>
<seg id="180">However, when such treatment, finally, inevitably turn out to be ineffective for many patients face another financial reason for concern "about the future of the families that they would leave.</seg>
<seg id="181">And then they ask the courts for compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan, of Field Fisher Price Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"it has been known that asbestos is harmful to health, in 1898," said Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But that changed in the 1960s, is that it became clear that even very small quantities can put their health at risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">It was then spoke about the bad faith of companies.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and hospital Guy, ultimately, resolve the matter, but this was not a "settlement at full price," according to Morgan, as Lawson could not clearly prove that his mesothelioma was a result of exposure to asbestos in the hospital, Guy.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation into his death, a spokesman for the hospital, Guy is confirmed, however, that "asbestos in its basement, mentioned above, was removed in the 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="188">It was too late for Andrew Lawson's.</seg>
<seg id="189">How to remove asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">Strictly speaking, and bind to lethal exposure to asbestos to one company or place of work - usually through dozens of years after that, it turned out to be a big problem for patients with mesothelioma, demanding compensation.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have changed owner or shut down.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance archives could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who have protected from lawsuits, and know that on their side, which the plaintiffs, of course, no.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, earlier this year took a serious new legislative acts which facilitate patients with mesothelioma process recovery of compensation, even if their former employers cannot be tracked.</seg>
<seg id="195">In accordance with this law, was created by £350-миллионный fund of funds, which is financed by the insurance industry, for those who had been diagnosed after July 2012 and who cannot prove to contact, but who are not with whom to sue.</seg>
<seg id="196">In such cases, patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in a case about the compensation of about £pirates.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful claims under this scheme is expected to be every year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with mesothelioma, believes that the £350 million represent a "very good work" for the industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"this transaction, which insured for insurers," he says, hinting that the sum is a quarter of that, insurers would have to pay if it had not intervened time and patients with mesothelioma would be able to trace the company and file a lawsuit in the usual way.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even Mike Пеннинг, previously minister for work and pensions, acknowledged that the law "imperfect."</seg>
<seg id="201">But Пеннинг, and Morgan acknowledged that, in view of the fact that seven people die every day, rapid action was needed.</seg>
<seg id="202">"people suffer so much, and they need help now," said Пеннинг during the second reading of the Bill about Kolya in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">By the time Graham cost was in the hands of Professor Лоика Ланж-Лаздунски 19 months.</seg>
<seg id="204">After the initial consultation Ланж-Лаздунски recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Трежера, he believes to be effective.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was followed by radiation and chemotherapy -- тритерапия in which Ланж-Лаздунски boasts pristine 40 percent surviving patients for five years.</seg>
<seg id="206">Cost felt a surge of strength.</seg>
<seg id="207">"this is, of course, one of the most important things," says cost.</seg>
<seg id="208">You see these patients all the time.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is a force that supports you.</seg>
<seg id="210">When сдаешься, condition can deteriorate very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham cost went on an operation in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">By the end of August he finished last of six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">Subsequent scans showed no trace of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I did a scan in March [2014].</seg>
<seg id="215">There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I just should have been within reach 50.</seg>
<seg id="217">This is not a threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="218">This is the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="219">And again the cost went through six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now there is no trace of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="221">However, this process is both physically and emotionally heavy.</seg>
<seg id="222">You can think about practical things - about finances, and when I die, for example, or about the fact that we need to show his wife how timer on бойлере.</seg>
<seg id="223">When you get bad news, you become безрадостным.</seg>
<seg id="224">We need to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="225">As the father of Ellie, 16 years old, and Тэмзин, 14 years old, it is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">"it's hard for the parent," he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.</seg>
<seg id="228">When I first got diagnosed, I told the girls that I had the disease, which means that I won ’ t live to old age.</seg>
<seg id="229">They reacted very differently.</seg>
<seg id="230">Тэмзин very social and energetic.</seg>
<seg id="231">She said all of her friends, and we quickly called for many.</seg>
<seg id="232">Ellie was more demure.</seg>
<seg id="233">She didn't say much.</seg>
<seg id="234">Such talk is something that has to have all patients with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="235">But for patients with mesothelioma such discussions people hope, even проблеском opportunities to survive.</seg>
<seg id="236">This disease of sex is (even as, ultimately, for Steven Jay Гулда) grim certainty.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders, protesters promise revenge</seg>
<seg id="2">Parliament's decision on Sunday does not allow voters in Hong Kong nominate candidates for elections in 2017, despite increasing demands for democratic reforms.</seg>
<seg id="3">Such a move would likely mark the beginning of long ago promised protests in Hong Kong as activists have begun planning and mobilization in a matter of hours after that statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the 11th National People's Congress, in fact, communist leaders to remove all the candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it's not обмануло our expectations, but still leads in rage," said lawmaker Emily Лау, chairman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is not something that Beijing has promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">They lied to people in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defending the decision of China, Li Fey, Deputy General Secretary of the Standing Committee of the 11th National People's Congress, said that to allow public nominations for the election of Hong Kong would be too "erratic behavior."</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing promised to allow residents of the region to choose by voting the head of government, starting in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chinese leaders have presented the Sunday decision as a democratic step forward, since it gives гонконгцам right to direct the vote; however the resolution also makes clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process in his hands with the aid of the Commission on the Nomination, rigidly controlled from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, according to a new article that only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be admitted.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision was taken after the summer, when there have been some of the most large-scale and received wide coverage of protests in Hong Kong for many years.</seg>
<seg id="14">For a large part of after campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, which threatened to cut off the financial district in Hong Kong if Beijing does not guarantee real universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sunday night, a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central gathered in the rain in front of the headquarters of the government of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="16">The demonstration, which organisers claimed that their movement is shifting to a new phase of civil disobedience and that they rise up on the waves of protest in the next few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, they have not reported the details, obviously, to avoid problems with government bodies.</seg>
<seg id="18">In онлайн-заявлении organizers reported that the movement "обдумывало any takeover of the central district only as an exceptional measure, action that can be taken only if all the possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We regret to inform you that as of today, all the possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the seizure of the central region undoubtedly will.</seg>
<seg id="20">Authorities in Hong Kong were preparing to Beijing a few days, and on Sunday at the headquarters of the government had strengthened security measures involving police and barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">The unrest is a sense among many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their own city.</seg>
<seg id="22">An influx of residents from mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also intensifies the fear that values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, and begin to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some have criticized the movement Occupy Central, saying that his demonstration to jeopardize the business is the source of life force in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the protest, which they say it could cause great economic damage, depending on how many people would take part or how long," said lawmaker Regina Yip, who has long been critical of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="26">We don't want to spread concern about the fact that Hong Kong can spin out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This view, which is harmful for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chinese state media also gave reports in recent days, in which Hong Kong activists of the democratic movement were shown диверсантами, направляемыми Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral law, which drew tripped participants - more than one-fifth of voters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in July, tens of thousands took to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists are raising questions of racial identity and behavior of police after Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">Unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Фергюсоне, Missouri, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">Coming are raising their hands, chanting: "hands up, don't ice" while they wait in line in front of the burial.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Фергюсоне, Missouri with murder безоружного teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam зоила Perez noticed a shift in интернет-разговоре among white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">In her experience, the white feminists, leave comments put gender above race, when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, as the increased tension in the Midwest and attracted national attention, Peres saw the white women who focused 100 percent on the race.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared with the reaction of black women shortly after the killing on 9 August, personal essays with such titles as "thoughts about Фергюсоне on behalf of a white woman" and "Феминизм is not the only example of women" came relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Perez, they demonstrated a significant shift.</seg>
<seg id="9">"in feminism, I don't think there are many people who are talking about white skin and Privileges on such a high level," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People feel the need to say something about what has happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's very symbolic for the crisis with which we are faced, and because of the situation in Фергюсоне) is so tied to race, they feel that it is necessary to specify.</seg>
<seg id="12">For a professor of English at the University of Ohio Кориты Mitchell Ferguson has laid bare problems with which Blacks one faced every day, but which are not perceived as "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can write something funny on Facebook about what was going on with me and my partner and get 150 лайков from everywhere," says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">When I write something about how colored people are attacked in his own country, silence clearly.</seg>
<seg id="15">"why do women safely to publicly speak about the relationship, but not about the security in the public sector?" she asks.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women, like Mitchell, who studied the issues of race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between matters relating to race and gender.</seg>
<seg id="17">From her point of view, blacks, women are in a position to clearly separate the problems; they are faced with a complex reality every day.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women now bring together issues of race and gender in feminist мейнстриме, Энджела Хэттери, professor of women's and gender studies at the University of George Mason, said that its predecessor did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"between 1865 and 1890 years линчевали at least 10,000 black men, and the reason that is almost always served as the rape of white women," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="20">Need a white woman, was a story to justify Nepal.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the point of view of Хэттери, the gap between white and black women occurred when white you have, for example, Susan B. Anthony looked at the situation in the late 1800s, and saw that the fight for suffrage will be effective only for one of the groups: women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"they decided to put all its eggs in the basket of voting rights for women, and the right to vote for blacks would appear later," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="23">Look back on things like this gives us a clear idea of why colored women don't trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have not done anything good.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to ensure that the white women united against mob lynchings in the women of the South for preventing mob lynchings.</seg>
<seg id="27">This group appeared nearly 40 years after blacks, women first asked for help, "said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">From the point of view of Mitchell, the reactions of white feminists on the issues raised in Фергюсоне, "the behavior of the police, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white a feminist had to" catch up "problems with which Blacks women cope in several generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"however, it would be fine, if female, which have such a [traditional феминистическая] ideology, so seriously would be to raise a child, how they relate to the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.</seg>

<seg id="32">"I hope that women who have a different, but similar reason to understand the danger of the body - and the point of view of the racial problems that are substantially different in surveys of the public - will be at the head of the change," wrote Стайнем.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Стайнем she vouched for more пересекающийся feminism, which includes and issues of race and gender, her comments about race in America still are surprised by some.</seg>
<seg id="34">A researcher at the American entrepreneurial institute Christina Соммерс, author of "Who stole feminism?," she said She The People that young men in the United States, especially colored young men, "are much more vulnerable than their sisters', but negative Стайнем about Фергюсоне contradict criticism, which it clear earlier.</seg>
<seg id="35">We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for the boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">But when the White House has recently initiated a programme, "Сторож my brother" to help the vulnerable black and испаноговорящим boys, followed in the US changed remarkably reaction from many feminists, including those from Gloria Стайнем.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ministry wants to accelerate the growth of the market for electric cars</seg>
<seg id="2">This week the Ministry of Economic Development will make the government a comprehensive development plan for clean vehicles in Russia, told the deputy director of the ministry, Oleg Плужников round table that held the Vedomosti on Moscow Carlisle - 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">The plan is drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals is to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is expected that the document will be passed in late September and early October, says Плужников, proposed measures concern the electric cars and hybrids - a development plan for vehicles on газомоторном fuel in Russia already have.</seg>
<seg id="5">The plan (a copy by Vedomosti) is designed for 2014-2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">Yet to develop assessment criteria for electrical and hybrid vehicles and decide how to promote the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">A report to the government, which will describe the tax and customs measures to support quality, will be prepared by December 2014, the scheme of preferential loans and preferential leasing will emerge by April 2015, and proposals to reduce the prices of cars, promotion localization and the creation of service the infrastructure will be developed by October 2015</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014-2015, is expected to amend the regulations to ease conditions for construction charge infrastructure (in carparks, filling stations, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, federal officials plan for 2015 to formulate for regional government proposals to also promote the use of clean transport - in the form of granting him benefits when driving and parking, for example; and at the end of February 2016 - and proposals on the expansion of the government purchases of such transport.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, the Ministry of Economic Development by October 2014, on a list of indicators for evaluation of the activities of the regional authorities of criteria that reflect the effectiveness of the support for the production of clean transport development in charge of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="11">The market in electric cars in Russia, while only formed in 2013 across the country sold around 100 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="12">In early 2014 обнулена import duty on electric cars, so sales will be approximately 500 pieces, predicts Chief Executive Director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="13">But пятикратный growth does not Sunderland any noticeable: in 2013, according to the Association of European Businesses, sold 2,78 million passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="14">While in Russia, Sunderland imports only Mitsubishi Motors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Start import preparing Renault - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships Renault Nicolas Ремиз.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most of the other manufacturers' electric vehicles took in relation to Russia is taking a wait-and-see approach.</seg>
<seg id="17">Development of electric cars is, and the Russian producers - "" GAZ CEO, "" but the trivial.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in January - July 2014, according to the "АСМ-холдинга," Avtovaz has issued 30 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="19">Demand is also degrading because of soaring prices, admits director of AvtoVAZ engineering Sergei Аманов, without state support the breakout in this segment will not.</seg>
<seg id="20">The development of the Russian market in electric cars in addition to the cost of cars (those electric cars that are sold in Russia, on average twice as expensive counterparts with the internal combustion engine (ICE) is an underdeveloped charge infrastructure (Economics - units), sighs CEO "Автостата" Sergei Целиков.</seg>
<seg id="21">Because of the soaring prices and low rates of decline in the cost of electric cars in the next 3-4 years remain нишевым segment of the Russian market, predicts editor in chief "Авторевю" Mikhail Подорожанский, Целиков with him, agrees.</seg>
<seg id="22">Manufacturers, by contrast, say that some models of electric cars is already close to the value of the ordinary.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Russian market is substantially good prospects, the important thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "электромобильность" real; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of the new charging stations, underscores the president of BMW's Wolfgang Шлимме.</seg>
<seg id="24">Such infrastructure projects by, for example, the "Россети": in Moscow built several stations, soon there will be more about 80.</seg>
<seg id="25">Talks on the construction of a network of Economics carried out with other regions.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to the director of the department "Россетей" Vladimir Софьина, the company believes the market for electric cars and is ready to build gas stations across the country, but there are problems: a small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging different brands.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, "Россети" as network the company does not have the right to engage in the sale of electricity, being able to do this in relation to charging.</seg>
<seg id="28">His wife believes the most effective measure of state support for the Russian market substantially progeSOFT customs duties.</seg>
<seg id="29">Zero rate will act before the end of 2014, its renewals, extensions of preferential list.</seg>
<seg id="30">The replacement vehicle tax on ecological (the idea is being discussed and concerns all machines), too, will support the market, but not as noticeably as customs preferences, according to his wife.</seg>
<seg id="31">Tax in Russia is small, said Pankov, unlike, for example, from Norway, where the reduced tax rate led to a sharp rise in sales of electric cars -- now they account for 12% of the market.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia are needed and stimulus measures to curb speculative, such as free parking in the centre of town (as it has done in Moscow), I am sure Pankov, or any movement substantially in dedicated lanes, which Russia has not.</seg>

<seg id="6">On the night of August 29, the White House said that President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will discuss any imposition of additional sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The weakening of the ruble is long-term in nature and, in tandem with the euro, and in tandem with the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="8">The long-term forecast assumed that mark, "says senior analyst" Alpari "Anna Бодрова.</seg>
<seg id="9">All of that has to do with Ukraine, one way or another will be reflected on the courses.</seg>
<seg id="10">As long as this continues, investors will react.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, rumors about the invading troops are not confirmed nor with one hand, but the market was very emotional.</seg>
<seg id="12">All the talk about the fact that he was resistant to such news, yesterday were перечеркнуты.</seg>
<seg id="13">This week, according to specialist closes near those levels - 36,90 and 37,05 roubles per dollar.</seg>
<seg id="14">The tax period ended, oil prices are weak, a policy of sanctions, the problem of transit of gas through Ukraine are all links in the same chain.</seg>
<seg id="15">Forecast also accelerates inflation: the current prices for fall by end-2010 from 5 to 10 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon, the same end seasonal vegetables and fruits, and there will be a vacuum, so long as the network переориентируются on other suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="17">"the dollar went up to 37 roubles, went through it and came back, some powerful hysteria," said head of analysis of markets "Opening Broker" Konstantin Bushuev.</seg>
<seg id="18">Still, will look at whether to impose on Saturday promised sanctions, as will meet NATO.</seg>
<seg id="19">The ruble, in his words, "severely weakened after the end of tax season, then went to the news on Ukraine, by the same token, the Central Bank last week said that before the end of the year will be transferred to a floating exchange rate and waives any currency interventions.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you look at the daytime wobble, then it is no different from the previous ones during this month, all have spooked that mark in 37 rubles, "continued the analyst.</seg>
<seg id="21">And so, in terms of turnover nothing powerful never happened.</seg>
<seg id="22">Worrying times for the currency market were, as I recall when, in late January was an increased demand for the currency, as well as 3rd March, when the Central Bank отгрузил a record number of currency.</seg>
<seg id="23">In UFS IC see the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="24">First of all, this increase in the revenue part of the budget from the export operations, as well as to increase the competitiveness of domestic manufacturers at the expense of the expensive imports, says chief analyst UFS IC Alexei Kozlov.</seg>
<seg id="25">The negative moments can include prices of imported goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency to significantly reduce the attractiveness of the investment in the Russian economy, provoke growing inflationary pressures and, as a result, can cause expensive borrowing cash, which, in turn, slows down the development of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="27">If we talk about the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble several smoothes over fall in share prices, expressed in roubles.</seg>
<seg id="28">For example, the MICEX Index during trading Thursday fell 1.67 percent and the RTS had lost 3.27 percent.</seg>
<seg id="29">Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of reduction of indices due to the weakening of the ruble during the day more than 1.5%.</seg>
<seg id="30">The weakening of the ruble is an emotional character and can be explained by a massive desire to buy the currency.</seg>
<seg id="31">In practice, gradually emotions go on there, and quotes the ruble partially or fully restore some lost ground.</seg>
<seg id="32">"we believe, soon we will be able to see the value of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles to the dollar," said Alexei Kozlov.</seg>

<seg id="5">In the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion in the coffers of the state and local level in fiscal 2013, to 3.8 percent more than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.</seg>

<seg id="7">Taxes, has grown faster, 4.3 percent, than the local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to the study, which was conducted by providing professional services, Ernst & Young and the Center for taxable state group on tax policy.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the tax revenue in the county, 56 percent, in taxes on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of tax revenue Maryland falls on firms.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia, with 28 percent, is the lowest amount of tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="10">To a large extent, the growth in tax revenues caused by returning to the same level of value real estate companies, the researchers say, that raised property taxes by 3.7 per cent this year, after three years in a row, when growth was less than 1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large proportion of these revenues account for large states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same thing is happening in the Washington area.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion property taxes at the state and local level in the past year, to $9.6 billion more than in 2012, an increase of 4.2 per cent, compared with the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the observed return value of the property does not have a similar effect on the growth of tax revenue for the state and local level in Maryland, where property taxes barely exceed one-fifth of the tax bills of companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">Company, Virginia and the District of Columbia are paying about half the tax bills on the state and local level, in the form of property taxes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"what is happening in Maryland is that such a large part of their property, particularly tax base around the District of Columbia, is owned by either the government or nonprofit organization that does not pay property taxes," said Douglas Линдхолм, executive director of the Center on taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, Maryland has much more rely, for example, on income taxes to pay for those services that exist in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent increase in tax receipts from businesses cannot fully explain the recovery of the real estate market.</seg>

<seg id="3">The duo Royal Blood all year on the stage, but he already has the nomination on a premium BBC, tour opening Arctic Monkeys and visit гримерку New York concert from the Jimmy right.</seg>
<seg id="4">Their debut album, Leif even for a few months before release received 100,000 предзаказов and contract on his release lies in the major Warner Music.</seg>
<seg id="5">Given the current плачевную situation on the music market, the situation of lambasted, because this is not about new Lana del Ray, or regular сладкоголосом representative "of the new R 'n' B ', but the duo быковатых on British playing with the level of volume and intensity, that the last time was in vogue two decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">In general, rates on the first album in connection with all вышеозначенными circumstances were especially high and is already quite justified.</seg>
<seg id="7">The duo is not a coincidence that took his name, which previously could prejudice isn't that quite so desperate hairy metallers and blood which kings flows, how they think, they have in the veins, which is also understandable.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is, of course, primarily about the heroes of the past levels of Led Zeppelin, and the great quartet, Royal Blood aim to shake застоявшуюся blood British rock, put it to a new level.</seg>
<seg id="9">To make predictions about the success of this enterprise until, perhaps, pretty early, but some say it is already possible.</seg>
<seg id="10">A dozen songs, уложившихся thirty, with a few minutes - it's not so much a demonstration of the phenomenal композиторского gifts, how many Rock and a powerful statement of intent.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some of the dignity of the individual, of course, deny impossible: for example, a pilot single "Out of the Black" disregards the fact that influential than melodic line, and "party.</seg>

<seg id="13">It should be noted as well as powerful "Little Monster" and will record the song "Better emergency with шекспировской quote in the title.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the truth is that each of these songs will be perfectly sound at a party lovers of heavy rock, but when playing in a row they merge into a more or less uniform cloth.</seg>
<seg id="15">And this is not necessarily bad, on the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Royal Blood in the fact that they do not claim the new Lennon and McCartney (rather too mark in successors Motörhead), but numerous рок-дуэты from ghetto инди-клубов.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their music, despite some variety, created for stadiums, indoors, in less than a couple of thousand people, she is obviously closely.</seg>
<seg id="18">The secret lies in хитром using bass, took the guitar the usual format, thought at the beginning of the zero The Kicks.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, it is not only instruments, but also in the approach to writing songs.</seg>
<seg id="20">Heroes ретророка zero with great difficulty their outside of postmodern paradigm, with great reluctance, went on to admit himself not just эпигонами and independent creative units.</seg>
<seg id="21">Royal Blood is now sound so heavily and boorishly that this pressure successfully драпирует some вторичность and твердолобость musical material.</seg>

<seg id="3">The news was a surprise, not because no one expected that it would be sold, and because many people expected that YouTube will be a buyer.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago, selling it видеосервису Google for good billion looked completely finished, and this combination was a natural.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set a goal to be потоковым service general nature - version of YouTube in real time.</seg>

<seg id="7">Interface it.</seg>
<seg id="8">"let's play," genre movies, in which всезнайки give (mainly old) games, as in "Таинственном theatre", was already popular on YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="9">The fact is that YouTube is mentioned often, when we describe it, so the news that YouTube acquires it was without much interest, a classic example of a deep-rooted technology company выкупающей potential competitor.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's a mystery why deal with YouTube failed, given that, reportedly, he was willing to pay, no less than Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">All that we have at the moment is a statement from Executive Director it Emmett have: "we chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term objectives, and they want to help us get there faster."</seg>
<seg id="12">Another mystery, frankly, it is an incredible success it is.</seg>

<seg id="15">All of the games that you could watch right now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another problem is that many of the most popular today games are designed for one person, so I watch them shoot, not controlling the angle of view, can be a recipe for a headache, a worthy Do It Right.</seg>
<seg id="17">I agree that high-speed transmission, in which Роджеры Бэннистеры of our electronic age completing the whole game in record time, entertain.</seg>

<seg id="19">But what they know skeptics like me?</seg>
<seg id="20">There it is 55 million unique visitors per month, and it is the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.</seg>
<seg id="21">How Amazon works on this?</seg>
<seg id="22">It is hard to imagine that it свернется in Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube would simply absorb it.</seg>
<seg id="23">But it is a fact that gladly would have received any company: the crowd of young men, of whom dream of advertisers.</seg>
<seg id="24">Both said it Шир, Amazon and it is "both believe in the future of gaming," and the channel has signs, even "ouch" as a kind of sport.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cunning ways to save on university textbooks</seg>
<seg id="2">The fact that the cost of university textbooks for many students more than $1000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move to the second course, came up with an ingenious way to reduce costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">He developed a system of how to borrow books the старшекурсников, offering them rated compensation that they delayed their sale.</seg>
<seg id="4">"my textbook on mathematical analysis, which typically costs $180, which I got for a semester for $10 and biscuits" Chick-fil-A "," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying in Ковенант College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The literature on last semester cost would be $430, he says.</seg>
<seg id="6">He spent $120.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the Council of the colleges, the average student spends $1,200 a year on books and supplies, but the students have a number of options to reduce these costs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas, such system Schroeder.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rent books is becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use a book during the semester, and often costing substantially cheaper than buying them.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Нибо Инкорпорейтид", which holds more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of rental books grew by half since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">Research industry show that nearly a quarter of books in university bookstores during the past spring semester were taken, said the vice president "Нибо" Trevor Meyer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fewer than half of all books sold in university bookstores, according to the professional union, the National Association of Choirs shops. "</seg>
<seg id="13">Here's introductory course on the best ways to make a great deal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Purchase in store</seg>
<seg id="15">Sometimes, if you will connect to the Internet, the price of a new book could constitute one third of that, what you will see in the university bookstore.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis," Ron Larson ’ s Bruce Edwards and Robert Хостетлера worth about $290 privately, but a copy can be purchased for $239,99 site Chegg.com, which specialises in selling textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Buying подержанного</seg>
<seg id="18">If you don't mind other people's notes or injuries, second-hand textbooks are a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"mathematical analysis" sold for $93,49 in подержанном to Chegg.com.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Кэсэдей, 25, a student of the fourth course at the University of Бригэм Young, said that paid on Amazon.com 42 cents for a secondhand copy of the textbook "strategic decisions in the media: an understanding of the business side of the advertising business."</seg>
<seg id="21">The book sold for $48.</seg>
<seg id="22">Teachers, for instance, Ingrid Брейси, director of "College without walls" at the University of Massachusetts in Эмхерсте, offers students refine their professors, not whether to use previous editions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates are insignificant for classes.</seg>
<seg id="24">In such cases, the old editions can often be found in a very small fraction of the cost of the latest edition.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition to the websites, Chegg, Amazon and Half.com, "eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying second-hand books.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hire</seg>
<seg id="27">About to take textbooks to hire, you need to think, if you're well enough with them, don't forget to return them and don't want to leave them yourself after that is completed the course.</seg>
<seg id="28">You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, a student could rent a "Математический analysis" for a semester for about $20.</seg>
<seg id="30">Check the rules before the store, where you take the books, including any fines that you can write the notes, underscore and damage.</seg>
<seg id="31">If you take a book rental, remember: if you don't give the book, fines may even exceed the cost of the new instance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Electronic books</seg>
<seg id="33">Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks is another option.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sometimes such books actually take Geran, acquiring electronic license for a certain period for retailers, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.</seg>
<seg id="35">Hire "Mathematical Analysis" on the site Chegg.com for six months will cost about $61.</seg>
<seg id="36">Брейси says that students who study literature, can often find the most advantageous prices, as many of the classics are free, whereas literature on natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.</seg>
<seg id="37">No matter what, осмотритесь.</seg>
<seg id="38">Joe Who, 29, who will begin their studies in Thirteen Пеппердин, recommends that you use the commissions to investigate the price of the book, as it ensures that you are looking for precisely the right you text.</seg>
<seg id="39">But before you order online, "says Who, be sure to check whether a book is in stock.</seg>
<seg id="40">For him the lesson Hemsedal is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="41">The delivery of the books, which he bought, was postponed for four weeks, and, in the end, he paid the full price at the university bookstore.</seg>

<seg id="39">Санкционное menu</seg>
<seg id="40">On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree applying specific economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which is basically food sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="41">The country banned import of beef, pork, meat and offal names from poultry, meat, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cheese, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausage and sugar syrups.</seg>
<seg id="42">The restaurants began jockeying seems with suppliers: food prices have increased, we must urgently seek counterparts from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="43">More likely it will have an impact on expensive restaurants with монокухней France, Italy, Spain, in which products supplied directly from "motherships" countries.</seg>
<seg id="44">Общепиту had activities and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="45">For example, when, at the beginning of 2014, the Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and the year before - the American and Canadian meat.</seg>
<seg id="46">In return, the suppliers have supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="47">But sanctions лета-2014 proved to be far more serious.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the president's decree, which lifted the ban fry Atlantic salmon and trout, безлактозное milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for replanting.</seg>
<seg id="49">The Italian transfer hopes that sanctions might still смягчиться.</seg>
<seg id="50">In the meantime, some restaurants exists under conditions of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="51">According to the company's "East-West", one of the largest suppliers of world, the proportion of imported products in the premium segment accounted for up to 70%.</seg>
<seg id="52">"expensive restaurants may change menus under that produce local farmers and other countries," says Sergei Mironov, another, owner of the agency "Рестконсалт."</seg>
<seg id="53">If the strong, for him it's not going to be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="54">But we have very little of these cooks, and the development of new menu items may take two to three months.</seg>
<seg id="55">Тригель from the restaurant "Brasserie The Bridge" to it ready: refuse will be between 10-15 per cent of dishes, even half of the menu - recycle.</seg>
<seg id="56">In restaurants with a kitchen are starting to replace dishes, for example steak from marble beef - on бефстроганов, says Sergei Mironov.</seg>
<seg id="57">"cheeses from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian cheeses and cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," lists the "East-West" Oksana Глибчук.</seg>
<seg id="58">Cream and milk products from Europe have counterparts in Russia and Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="59">Chicken from the United States may be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and park from Norway - salmon, семгой, surrounded from Belarus and Chile.</seg>
<seg id="60">The absence of vegetables and fruits of European production may be at the expense of domestic manufacturers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.</seg>
<seg id="61">According to Mironov, budgetary network restaurants re-build will be easier than премиальному segment: unlikely there went the Reeperbahn, able to distinguish between the Italian моцареллу from Russian.</seg>
<seg id="62">Although it is difficult to have institutions Ginza Project, he says.</seg>
<seg id="63">The Ginza Project a few dozen restaurants under different brands and with their own menu.</seg>

<seg id="66">The owners of Café Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine stress that products from the former Soviet republics ароматнее European</seg>
<seg id="67">But a lot and restaurants, which sanctions almost never affected.</seg>
<seg id="68">These include schools with kitchen CIS: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.</seg>
<seg id="69">"the Georgian kitchen no expensive products," says Хатуна Колбая, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and cafes "Vai мэ!."</seg>
<seg id="70">All cheeses for us to do in Russia, the basis of many dishes - chicken fillets, exotic herbs we don't use. "</seg>
<seg id="71">In establishments Колбаи until removed from the menu of a single cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="72">Timur colon, owner of the restaurants "high-born N1" with Uzbek cuisine, sanctions also might alert: change he will have only sausages on новозеландскую.</seg>
<seg id="73">If Russia our owned imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we even win in price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="74">From the CIS can be cheaper to get engineering, sausages, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit.</seg>
<seg id="75">At the same time, what brought from Central Asia, far better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="76">The Uzbek tomatoes all know that they are tasty, sweet.</seg>
<seg id="77">The Spanish one never says.</seg>

<seg id="79">Of its intention to replace the European imports in Russia almost immediately after the sanctions said Belarus and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="80">Restaurants now that responded to the request "'s", is also quite calmly respond to sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="81">The McDonald's said that localization exceeds 85 per cent, and the network is working with 160 Russian suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="82">According to Tatyana Богдановой, head of the department for work with suppliers in public areas, about 80% of the food network buys in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with supplies of vegetables and increased prices for meat products that produce from the imported raw materials.</seg>
<seg id="83">In "Теремке" санкционные foods "generally have no more than 4%.</seg>
<seg id="84">Not affected by sanctions and лапшичную "Воккер."</seg>

<seg id="90">Even in the Georgian restaurants the dishes will grow by 5-10%, concedes Колбая.</seg>
<seg id="91">"East-West" didn't deny, "for example, the Belarusian milk products since August prices by 10-15 percent."</seg>
<seg id="92">"Brazilian suppliers raised prices for pork twice," complains Sergei Cancer, deputy director general of "Стардогс."</seg>

<seg id="96">Now, and so very undesirable to raise prices, "says Cancer.</seg>
<seg id="97">According to statistics, the increase in revenues was catering for the second quarter of 2014, just 1.8%.</seg>
<seg id="98">This is the smallest rate since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="99">Retail prices will rise further, he admits, but it is unclear how quickly: while most restaurateurs запаслось products over the next two months, hoping to wait out their purchase prices.</seg>

<seg id="19">The Finance Ministry wants to block savings certificates to the bearer, but will allow banks to do their analogue безотзывного contribution.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Finance Ministry is preparing a bill that would prohibit savings certificates to the bearer.</seg>
<seg id="21">Lately, this tool is gaining popularity, as rates here are higher than on bank deposits.</seg>
<seg id="22">The fact is that savings certificates on bearer does not fall into a system of deposit insurance and bank they are cheaper because they don't have to make payments to the Fund Deposit Insurance Agency (pointed out).</seg>
<seg id="23">Successfully situation in the fact that this step will be taken because of the small and medium-sized banks, spreading such certificates, and suffer from Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which, according to estimates pointed to control 98% of the level of the market.</seg>
<seg id="24">With the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, which is about 3.5%.</seg>
<seg id="25">The problem, explains the pointed out, is that the customers of a bank that bought such a certificate, in case of withdrawal he had license to try to get money into pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates to the bearer, may assume that their investment is insured.</seg>
<seg id="27">Informed the absence of insurance payouts on those certificated in case of license revocation the bank can lead to misunderstandings and social tensions.</seg>
<seg id="28">In practice, the agencies were cases when holders предъявительских certificates to seek indemnities through the court, "he said in a pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="29">The problem, of course, made-up.</seg>
<seg id="30">For paying customers of certificates still nobody will, as they have under the law has no right to compensation from the State.</seg>
<seg id="31">If the case was that the instrument is insured in pointed, together with him banned would and metal accounts, which means citizens are in grams of one of four metals: gold, silver, platinum and palladium.</seg>
<seg id="32">Since these accounts do not fall into a system of deposit insurance, but their existence until nobody deprives.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is likely that the bearer is very convenient, certifying that actually can act in the role of квазиденег.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the same time, their movements is not amenable to control: any bank customer can buy a certificate to every citizen, and to putting this certificate can change a lot of owners.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is no coincidence that the draft that savings certificate must be issued in a valuable paper, which must be stored in depositories.</seg>
<seg id="36">And that ’ s one banks such certificates be permitted to manufacture without the right to early repayment.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have introduced similar безотзывного contribution, which has long been a dream of the bankers.</seg>

<seg id="2">The talks at the highest level in Minsk has not solved the problems for which they were called back, but has also produced a new format: the first face of the European Union met with the chief executives of a future Eurasian</seg>
<seg id="3">Let the disturbing drift about (the situation around Ukraine отлагательств does not tolerate), the leaders of the EU and Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of "hot issues."</seg>
<seg id="4">It is capable of such a structure to work effectively, it is not clear; but it is clear who took the cream from that summit.</seg>
<seg id="5">Questions on this one evening on August 26, when the Belarusians, and after them and other евразийцы with Europeans saw change the new President Lukashenko.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Belarusian leader revealed example отточенной учтивости, it was the behavior of a man who had just caught the jackpot - and is planning a decent old age in high society.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Maidan Lukashenko helped</seg>
<seg id="8">The arrival in Minsk just three main European commissioners (of the EU), who met with Mr. Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf -- not just легитимация president for the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is an application for recognition of a full-fledged subject of European policy, and a major campaign of the Ukrainian crisis.</seg>
<seg id="10">A senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Studies Denis Мельянцов sure: from now on, Brussels can't already speak with Minsk in the same tone as before.</seg>
<seg id="11">"what Catherine Ashton met face to face with Lukashenko, gives reason to believe that the relationship with the EU will be размораживаться and beyond," he said "Огоньку."</seg>
<seg id="12">The debates have hidden part: prepare for the breakthrough, the Belarusian authorities have begun well before November Maidan in Kiev - summer 2013-го.</seg>
<seg id="13">"had achieved results and with the EU's successful negotiations for the simplification of the visa regime and readmission, dialogues about modernization," lists interlocutor of Ogonyok which -- and with the United States have held talks on international security.</seg>
<seg id="14">States even took a little bit of sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="15">As regards the Ukrainian events, then they themselves and the response to guide Belarus only invoked another influx this process.</seg>
<seg id="16">Minsk, on the one hand, managed to preserve relations with Ukraine are fairly warm, so not much to lose in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for talks.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, de jure not recognized the annexation of Crimea by Russia and urged to punish pro-Russian militia-men in Donbas with all severity, not quarreled with Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="18">Minsk has not released any of the Customs Union, nor from the Collective Security Treaty Organization, but sometimes it is the Russian air base.</seg>
<seg id="19">Brussels and Washington have noticed a balanced position of Minsk to the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated her confident Belarusian experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">How successful will the movement Lukashenko to a policy of diversification, will be seen by how often in the near future, Minsk доведется take meetings in the format of the EU + TC.</seg>
<seg id="21">The press office of the EU High Representative for foreign policy and diplomacy Catherine Ashton failed to answer questions about what Brussels wants from the relationship in a new format.</seg>
<seg id="22">A spokesman for Ashton Maya Косьянчич only said "Огоньку" that on matters of war and peace, this issue is not a priority.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the same time, there are reports that following a meeting on the Ukraine issue, with the participation of the people in the new format may be, and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="24">A drop of tar in Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that about him, it turns out, personally asked representatives of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nevertheless, at the final briefing Alexander Lukashenko made it clear: all sides are not opposed to Minsk remained a central platform for meetings, both in format Россия--ОБСЕ--Украина, and at the level of Heads of State and high representatives of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="26">This means that "the last dictator in Europe" becomes a quite рукопожатного European leader who helps solve a global problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">The best friend of the European farmer</seg>
<seg id="28">Already the delegation, which included еврокомиссаров on trade and energy, pushed to the conclusion: the main underlying reason for the summit -- not the tragic situation in the Donbas, and economy.</seg>
<seg id="29">In fact, сверстанное meeting schedule future talks on the gas supply and to overcome the fear of the CU in agreement about the association between Ukraine and the EU looks like an achievement and more extensive than peace declaration without specific dates and numbers.</seg>
<seg id="30">Trade Commissioner Karl De Гюхт, nevertheless, fax: EU officials "arrived in Minsk seek solution to the political crisis which has economic consequences, and not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="31">It seems, however, that the economic crisis in Ukraine "works" in Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its consequences - and above all reciprocal sanctions imposed by the West and Russia - give Minsk, who until he feels санкционное pressure, with room for maneuver.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to the leader of the Research Center of Mises, Belarus Yaroslav Ramanchuk, European investors are actively interested in opportunities to Belarus to supply agricultural products to the Russian Federation in bypassing sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="34">The nominated delivery scheme, for which President Vladimir Putin at the summit пожурил Minsk.</seg>
<seg id="35">"billions of these schemes," said Romanchuk "Огоньку," are not the Belarusian businessmen and Russian companies.</seg>
<seg id="36">They have long worked on a scheme of supplies of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes were destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Russian businesses urgently need to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of the Belarusian authorities.</seg>
<seg id="38">The second story, "continued expert, is connected with the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not away to Belarus from the raw materials as well as focusing on the Russian market.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Ukrainian producers about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and the Belarusian производственно-торговые scheme now could prove very popular. "</seg>
<seg id="40">According to Ramanchuk, the role of the host site for the negotiations between the EU and the TC is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of the development of economic ties with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="41">He recalls that the loss of the agricultural sector of EU sanctions against Moscow are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the Commission is currently proposed аграриям only 125 million euros in compensation.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Belarusian president could offer to Brussels to work together to minimise the consequences for еврофермеров.</seg>
<seg id="43">This could raise the authority of Lukashenko to the EU to unprecedented heights.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hospitality without initiatives</seg>
<seg id="45">Catherine Ashton thanked the authorities for the initiative for the summit.</seg>
<seg id="46">But the paradox is that the Minsk from his active role in birth format TS + EU открещивается, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with Ukrainian counterpart emphasized that the new format and it was Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="47">"it was your suggestion to come without навала discuss, not with бухты-барахты decide, after the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU, to sort out the situation, which at the time was in Ukraine," he remonstrated before the cameras to Peter Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, observers interpreted it as an attempt to calm Moscow, she had, according to rumor, was initially against the intermediation of Minsk, which greatly increases his political weight.</seg>
<seg id="49">In Belarusian diplomatic establishment try to stress that Belarus when organising cooperation between the EU and the TA on their soil did not pursue a lucrative target, but the ultimate goal of this format is to create in the future, a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.</seg>
<seg id="50">"this is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts which, in other areas, in particular in the field of security, proposes and promotes the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation," said "Огоньку" at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, the agency, which recently vigorously into words.</seg>

<seg id="2">The film Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez's "City грехов-2: woman, for which is killing" was not the revolution that it might have been expected.</seg>
<seg id="3">The first "City of sins" (2005), at minimum, but symbolic, the participation of Tarantino, a revolution in the relationship between movies, comic books and literary нуаром.</seg>
<seg id="4">The sequel, too, in its own way revolutionary, in the sense that it erodes fundamental to modern thinking chain "thesis - антитезис" synthesis "(if you understand as a thesis universe нуара, and by antithesis - space comic).</seg>
<seg id="5">From now on, it should read: "thesis - антитезис" chaos. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"the city грехов-2" хаотичен and драматургическом, and the philosophical level, both times he хаотичен in a bad mood.</seg>
<seg id="7">Yes, some of the characters are familiar with the "City", although that громила Марв (Mickey Рурк), I remember, had finished, life in the electric chair, and then, nothing, only enough time to rile - in the role of этакого folk дружинника - from air knives and axes удавками.</seg>
<seg id="8">But old men literally расталкивают elbows newcomers like вломившиеся into the city from some other movie, about the meaning and plot which spectators are asked not to worry.</seg>
<seg id="9">So, its own history, his clothes tattered and torn authors in an interesting spot, суперудачливого player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt's).</seg>
<seg id="10">Editorial - похотливо-фригидной Eve Lord (Eva Green) and for something мстящего her Dwight (Josh Бролин).</seg>
<seg id="11">But this confusion, in which Dwight in, say, a person not to distinguish from Johnny, the more that person, as well as other parts of the body, the characters to destroy with implacable arming regularity, "not a problem, and not even only half the problem.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's not people, we understand that these archetypes нуара: the fatal smoothly, too confident player угодивший in "медовую trap" sex detective, corrupt упырь-сенатор.</seg>
<seg id="13">Oh, and when an archetype вальсирует with an archetype and an archetype погоняет, then this is not a movie, and read that abstract painting.</seg>
<seg id="14">But ask an abstract painting, questions about the logic of the story is simply ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="15">Besides, even in this суматошном world is something permanent.</seg>
<seg id="16">Fighting whore from the first "City" still keep circular defense from осаждающих their native Chinese forces of darkness.</seg>
<seg id="17">Yes, and the ghost of detective Хартигана no, yes and came to light, and for Bruce Willis it's always nice to look at.</seg>
<seg id="18">The main problem, "Cities грехов-2" is another.</seg>
<seg id="19">Frank Miller was good, because both рисовальщик bed joined comic and нуар, and as a director, turned an idea of how to comic books to the screen.</seg>
<seg id="20">Comic and нуар - two aggressively opposing "reality."</seg>
<seg id="21">A phenomenon localized in the modern form was born in the late 1920s, at the same time, when novels Дэшила Хэммета 'computer' harvest '(1929), "went" (1930) and "Стеклянный key" (1931) created a canon нуара, именовавшегося then hard-boiled converge - "cool school".</seg>
<seg id="22">Well, or other defects.</seg>
<seg id="23">Comics have 41 many dozens of heroes: from морячка Попая - пожирателя youngish, giving him богатырскую force, Superman Returns, Batman and сыскаря Dick Tracy to Халка, Thor, Spider-Man and other "мстителей."</seg>
<seg id="24">But in any film based on the comic book was something ущербное: characters are stubbornly unwilling обрастать on-screen flesh remained притворяшками in surrounding them willy-nilly, "real" world.</seg>
<seg id="25">Put simply, they were left without "existence."</seg>
<seg id="26">Нуар, in contrast, was the most existential genre of world literature.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the world wars the traditional novel - with the experiences and personalities, family scandals and historical background - has lost all credibility.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Форсайты what Тибо and Ругон-Маккары which even Болконские and attended generally мыслимы after Вердена, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?</seg>
<seg id="29">This novel peacefully very little in the format of the soap opera, and criminal - that is, by definition, marginalized - novel возвысился to philosophical prose.</seg>
<seg id="30">Hammett found out the hard way that such work санитаром at the front.</seg>
<seg id="31">He was a communist.</seg>
<seg id="32">As, incidentally, were at least close to the Communist Party and such pillars of the genre, as writers of Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors FAB warnings, Joseph Лоузи, Edward Дмитрик.</seg>
<seg id="33">However нуар, an archetype of which they asked, firstly, rude and cynical, and secondly - purely социален.</seg>
<seg id="34">It is almost never an American version of Socialist Realism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The first "City of sins" was remarkable is the fact that desperate, but organically joined comic with нуаром.</seg>
<seg id="36">For the first time on screen comic came alive at this point, no borrowed their graphic nature, and never pretended to be a "real" film.</seg>
<seg id="37">Darkness sales around the world, where Cardinal order killings, but Senator wrapped monstrous сына-садиста, was entirely worthy of the pen Хэммета.</seg>
<seg id="38">But interesting details like imitated heads, which садист декорировал his tune, pen genius James Ellroy, author of "Black orchids" and better - that is stated тошнотворного - Representative неонуара.</seg>
<seg id="39">"the city грехов-2" - it's not even a retreat, and the capitulation of radical style Миллера--Родригеса before tradition localized.</seg>
<seg id="40">Perhaps, in many ways, it happened because of the technology, 3D.</seg>
<seg id="41">When looking at the "City of sins," consider yourself to be a prisoner in a glass ball, inside the snow falls asleep toy клоаку.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, more often than not it's not the snow, and bloody ошметки, but by and large what's the difference?</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin demands from Kiev to start negotiations on the "statehood" of eastern Ukraine</seg>
<seg id="2">According to Russian news reports about his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government has stopped fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately started negotiations on the "statehood" отделившегося region.</seg>
<seg id="3">His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later discloses that Putin had in mind the hint that восточноукраинская territory controlled by separatists will become part of Russia, but that her status within Ukraine should be revised to give русскоговорящему region the opportunity to defend their rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, calling Putin to furious the Government to start negotiations with the government-controlled insurgents as with equal corresponds to the obvious strategy, which he follows from the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: to help rebels take territory and force the Ukrainian government give новопровозглашенной territory Новороссии de facto independence, to closer ties with Russia rather than with the West.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with the state-controlled Channel 1 television, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return retained the separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, both of which were seized in March and April, after Moscow be much stricter in Europe Ukrainian peninsula Crimea on March 18.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists recently named captured territory Новороссией, or New Russia, the name, which refers to the дореволюционным days of glory of the Russian Empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin has said that anyone who believes that peace talks will occur in the near future, as Ukrainian politicians to campaign for parliamentary elections on October 26, and while government troops attack peace settlement in detained separatists regions, "пленник illusions", according to Itar-Tass.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we must immediately begin substantive talks and not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the public status of Southeast Ukraine, in order to serve the interests of the people living there," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskov said that Putin's about statehood had in mind in the context of a broader autonomy that was discussed during months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to allay fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and language rights at risk.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian government may give eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is not a matter for discussion between Russia and Ukraine, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and an internal Ukrainian conflict."</seg>
<seg id="12">Interference with press secretary the Kremlin to rectify "incorrect interpretation" words, Putin stressed the decision of the Russian leadership to behave towards the separatist rebellion in the east in any other way than to open the seizure of Crimea, where the majority of 2-миллионного population are ethnic Russians.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would have to endure much more heavy battle to attach even Donetsk and Луганскую region of eastern Ukraine, as the majority of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian, and polls before the start of the conflict, showed broad support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">Autonomy, which Russian diplomats discussed at international forums gave regional governments in the Ukraine power themselves to trade agreements and foreign policy, in effect giving the Kremlin de facto control over the territory, which would have combined the main Russian territory with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Black Sea peninsula, присоединенном five months ago, which is the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial marine institutions and historical sea resorts.</seg>

<seg id="18">However, his opinion on autonomy, it seems, is very different from the view of the Kremlin and повстанцев-сепаратистов, ITAR-Tass and abetting which accuse Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="19">Last call for Putin to Kiev to negotiate with the leaders of the separatists, as with equal, followed by new наступлениями rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks rolled into eastern Ukraine out of the formerly peaceful area along the Sea of Azov.</seg>
<seg id="20">Supported by Russian separatists took control of the city Новоазовск in the offensive of the Ukrainian security services say they are afraid that he is starting a campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory to the Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="21">This led to a large-scale civilian and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Новоазовском and narrow 27 on the Crimean peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko on Saturday addressed the meeting of leaders of the European Union in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which was independent of 23 years.</seg>
<seg id="23">"we are approaching a point of no return came," warned Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukrainian territory.</seg>
<seg id="25">EU summit had not taken certain measures; leaders urged to draw up a project more harsh sanctions against Russia, which will be taken in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.</seg>

<seg id="1">Anger has turned out to be the most versatile and functional emotion man</seg>
<seg id="2">Сердитое expression is biologically universal for humanity, and every participating in its body and the muscle is not fortuitous, but an additional means of expressing power and threat, researchers have found in Australia and the US.</seg>
<seg id="3">About their discovery, they reported in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly about them you can read the press release of the University of California in Santa Barbara.</seg>
<seg id="4">Гневное expression - running and by climbing in down the eyebrows, a thin line of the lips, 'bloated nostrils - equally in all cultures, and make it even blind from birth children, never who saw, says lead author of the study, Aaron Селл.</seg>
<seg id="5">As part of a major research project on the nature of the anger, the scientists found that arose this emotion for the effective conduct of disputes during the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="6">The more physical damage one man can do to another, the more he had opportunities to dictate their terms, and bring it up to partner with anger.</seg>
<seg id="7">Researchers have found evidence of another of his hypothesis: physically strong people often get angry and switch to pitch invasions, consider themselves entitled to impose other accept unpleasant conditions for them, and they prefer the methods of solving conflicts peacefully.</seg>
<seg id="8">Starting from that anger is primarily "emotion bargaining," the scientists decided that movements of each of the seven groups of muscles, creating сердитое expression must represent гневающегося individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor, and thereby force as soon as possible to agree to its terms in order to avoid conflict.</seg>
<seg id="9">To test this hypothesis, the researchers modelled on a computer, where they had or absent each of seven elements гневного faces, and showed them may be.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although by climbing in the eyebrows or but shutting down discussion simply means forward, chin individually do face evil, then this with such traits of man stronger physically, study participants acknowledged unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="11">The anger of a man, like animals, expresses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of his own forces, the reaffirmation to agree and to obey.</seg>
<seg id="12">Man inflated nostrils and поджимает lips with the same goal, and that frog, which надувается or бабуин, which demonstrates their fangs.</seg>
<seg id="13">"anger" runs "refusal to listen to accept the situation, and the face immediately takes shape, effectively has demonstrated the opposite side of the consequences of this failure.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the most striking is that none of the components гневного faces is not arbitrary, they are one and the same, "said anthropologist John Туби.</seg>
