<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have offered the bill, which is protected by the unions as a civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Where unions and middle-class jobs," says Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, who is co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive factions.</seg>
<seg id="4">That is why I am proud to represent the Act of expanding the rights of workers, along with the symbol of the movement for civil rights by John Lewis.</seg>
<seg id="5">This bill will give workers the same opportunities for legal discrimination against trade union organization, and other forms of discrimination, opponents of trade union power</seg>
<seg id="6">Changes in the regulation of labor relations in such a way as to allow the workers encountering discrimination for participation in trade union organizations, to seek justice in the civil courts, and compensation and punitive damages payments - a sensible and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it's certainly not radical initiative - at least by American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the best way to understand the fact that offer Ellison, Lewis and co-authors of the bill, "recall is a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the attacks, which the unions have in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country, Americans once supported countries all over the world to adopt, to expand and to respect human rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country at the same time, defend democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas MacArthur was ready and his assistants have helped the country to adopt a constitution, we have to ensure that autocracy which Хидеки Тодзё was replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly admitted that "the right of workers to organize and to negotiate, and the collective action is guaranteed."</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Эйзенхауер and his assistants have helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that fascism Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recognizing that workers will need to be organized and to be heard in the new state, the Germans have included an article that openly stated: "The right to form associations with the aim to protect and improve employment and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or activity.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict or seek to diminish that right, will have no legal force; measures for these purposes, be declared illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">When former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which was World Declaration on Human Rights, which in 1948, will be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the guarantee included the fact that "everyone has the right to organize and join unions to protect their interests."</seg>
<seg id="17">Generations of Americans take for granted our basic position that labor rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country is advised by other countries about how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans have explained that the right to organize labor unions - and the fact that this union has participated as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - should be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now, when these rights are under attack in America, wisely, actually, to go back to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to ensure that their voices were heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:</seg>
<seg id="21">History is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now everyone knows that the trade union movement is not undermined the nation's power, but increased them.</seg>
<seg id="23">Raising the living standards of millions, unions miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to fragile level of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack the unions, forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.</seg>
<seg id="25">History remembers as a must and to us.</seg>
<seg id="26">The official recognition of labour rights as human rights and the protection of civil rights, to prevent discrimination against the trade union organizations, was long overdue.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the U.S., a federal judge on Sunday temporarily has blocked the introduction of the Louisiana law, which his supporters say that he, most likely, will close all five абортных clinics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to this measure, which was signed by the Governor of Louisiana Bobby Джинадлом in June and was supposed to go into effect on September 1, doctors who do abortions, were obliged to have powers of patients in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the judge's decision means that, at the moment, doctors can continue to make legal abortion, while continuing to look for such powers.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Complainants will be allowed to work legally, continuing actions to gain power," he wrote in his decision, Judge John деГрэвеллз.</seg>
<seg id="6">The hearing will be scheduled within the next month, at which the judge made a more permanent solution on this law.</seg>
<seg id="7">Advocates for abortion rights welcomed the decision, the latest in a chain of decisions against similar measures, saying it will give doctors more time to receive hospital authority.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today's decision ensures that the women will be protected as the Louisiana law, which seeks to deprive them of the health and human rights," said Nancy Нортап, president and head of the Center for reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the state's five clinics.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the decision applies to doctors from two clinics, which were claimants in the case, and also filed a statement to authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, and the courts have recognized such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="11">Key parts of the law that would have closed техасского, most of the remaining clinics in this state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fighters for the right to abortion, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association say that laws about the credentials of doctors, not to impose limits that are necessary from the medical point of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, though some also pointed to positive effect in the closing clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only one doctor who does abortions in Louisiana, is in the hospital, said the Center for reproductive Rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all the other doctors in the state will be forced to stop performing the procedure, the doctor, fearing for their safety, would cease to perform this procedure, according to the group.</seg>
<seg id="16">Criticizing the decision, officials in Louisiana said that will not punish doctors doing abortions as long as their statements on the reception waiting for the decision.</seg>

<seg id="1">What will the introduction of quotas for domestic products</seg>
<seg id="2">Not less than half of the products for each type of product in the range trading networks should be the Russian production, says the State Duma deputy from the Just Russia faction, "Oleg Nilov.</seg>
<seg id="3">The MP has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures for domestic manufacturers, writes the newspaper Izvestia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The document will be some points, in order to avoid possible discomfort to buyers.</seg>
<seg id="5">This applies to goods that are produced in Russia. <... > According to the rest of the groups of products, which are produced in Russia, the will provide at least half of the production of their domestic producers, "Nilov told the publication.</seg>
<seg id="6">Together with the amendments, in the article "On the basis of state regulation of trading activities in the Russian Federation," the bill provides for the introduction of changes to the Tax Code, laying down a 10 per cent rate of VAT in Norway with the implementation of the products produced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea to introduce a 50% quota in -процентную retail chains included in the stimulus package for Russian producers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The shop will be several times more than domestic goods.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the initiative could have both a positive and a negative effect, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to attorney Налоговик ", a member of the independent centre of expertise" Public Duma Sergei Litvinenko for the Russian economy, as well as for domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive in nature, and will lead to growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">The key will be, farmers, small shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">They will be able to sell more, and it means that profits will grow.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms to retailers and prices, because they will be forced to buy their goods.</seg>
<seg id="14">Russian manufacturers will be able to increase the volume of its sales activities and that will lead to pay higher taxes than before.</seg>
<seg id="15">It will increase revenue, create new jobs, any industry will begin to expand any faster осваиваться, will be introduced to contribute to the growth of GDP.</seg>
<seg id="16">Russia's dependence on foreign food fall several times, but not immediately, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="17">Earlier, Russian companies are often unable to fight their way to the shelves of local stores due to higher competition from foreign counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche freed, and you can breathe a sigh of relief.</seg>
<seg id="19">But do not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary inspections to the Russian market will be food from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="20">In other words, it is now a "moment of calm" when the players have already left, and new ones not yet come.</seg>
<seg id="21">Almost a month later, we can say that the demand for Russian raw materials, as well as rising prices for finished products, "said АиФ.ru first Vice President of Russian public institutions," the Russian club financial directors, "Tamara Kasyanov.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clearly, the idea of selling in each category at least 50% of the Russian food products will be the sector for local producers.</seg>
<seg id="23">In that case, they will have to compete with one another, not with products that subsidies at the expense of another state, are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="24">In other words, the buyer will unfold between the companies, working on a single law.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, says Kasyanov, Russian producers are able to meet 50% of domestic needs compatriots not on all items.</seg>
<seg id="26">And in this situation commercial networks will have "дотягивать" share of Russian goods up to half of the range.</seg>
<seg id="27">In this context, increasing fears that the president will be substandard goods.</seg>
<seg id="28">Perhaps under the guise of manufactured in Russia, will be delivered to foreign products with перебитыми labels, "adds an expert.</seg>
<seg id="29">A negative effect from the introduction of quotas are large trading networks, especially those which выгодней cooperate with importers.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is logical that the job-seeking will suffer and the foreign suppliers, because the demand for their products.</seg>
<seg id="31">Litvinenko did not rule out that the law on quotas on domestic goods may impact on consumers.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fact is that some of the products may yield in the quality of imported ones, while shops will be boosting prices on the second as a scarce commodity.</seg>
<seg id="33">The revolutions in the early 2000s, import substitution idea economists have started talking again in February this year because of the ongoing devaluation of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="34">Now, against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the issue of the import of products becomes even more urgent.</seg>
<seg id="35">The law aims to compel retailers to suppliers in the orders from domestic producers.</seg>
<seg id="36">Then we are much faster and more confident we will go on the path of import substitution, the planning system and the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter period of time, "says the MP Oleg Nilov.</seg>
<seg id="37">Especially effective mechanism of quotas will be for the agricultural sector, where the potential is especially high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.</seg>
<seg id="38">Our farmers are able to fully cover the shelves in Russian shops.</seg>

<seg id="1">Inflation out of the vacation.</seg>
<seg id="2">Whether Russians feel a sharp rise in prices</seg>
<seg id="3">As a result of Western sanctions and the November inflation accelerates in Russia and not in forecasts уложится, analysts believe, "VTB Capital."</seg>
<seg id="4">According to experts, the deferred effects антисанкций will lead to modest goal as ever in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the latest forecast, inflation in 2014 will be 6,5-7,5% the following year - less than the 6.5 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to the newspaper, "Kommersant," the commentary this week should make a "small but significant" changes in macroeconomic forecast up to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the publication, the agency may lower the inflation rate in 2015, which will eliminate progeSOFT expected revenue growth of the population.</seg>
<seg id="8">The forecast, it was assumed that the food sanctions apply a year - until August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">In such a situation, you could assume such high inflation?</seg>
<seg id="10">The current situation is a shock, but geared понижательный trend of inflation does not change, "the source said to the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="11">Economists from VTB Capital "is not shared by the government's economic expectations of inflation and the forecast price growth in 2014 at the level of 8%.</seg>
<seg id="12">The main effect of product bans will come together with the introduction of the sales tax in the regions of the Russian Federation (GAP) in 2015, experts believe.</seg>
<seg id="13">Inflationary spike in 9% in February, after which the annual pace of price growth will decline, experts believe.</seg>
<seg id="14">By the way, last week brought the first of the new note, after Russia imposed a "neat sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="15">АиФ.ru interviewed experts and found their inflationary expectations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Artem Деев, head of the analytical department of FC AForex:</seg>
<seg id="17">Already there has been a rise in prices for goods.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moreover, when I began to appreciate the socially relevant products, the government was forced to launch measures of monitoring systemic risks to price stability, in order to prevent unreasonable price increases in the short term.</seg>
<seg id="19">Suppliers and retailers already report on a daily basis before regulators that authorities knew exactly who, where and for what reason will trigger an increase in prices.</seg>
<seg id="20">Key factors for the growth of the consumer price index continues to be tremendous pace of capital flight, excessive refinancing the banking sector from the Russian мегарегулятора, converting the flight of foreign currency, as well as an embargo on the import of food products from the countries that joined the sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="21">If inflationary pressures remained under control, the cost of a minimum basket of food has jumped by 12% in only one quarter.</seg>
<seg id="22">The ban on the import of food products provoked shock proposals on the internal market and led to a higher final cost логичному.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because at this stage we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, and increase self-sufficiency of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production, a response to the inflationary risks sanctions will continue to grow.</seg>
<seg id="24">If you add one and fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the local currency, as well as ухудшенными prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year, inflation could exceed 8%.</seg>
<seg id="25">Alexander Разуваев, director of the analytical department of Alpari. ""</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 1990s, inflation sometimes hit 20-30% per month to zero, it was also higher than the current level, another thing that then it offset rapid economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="27">I think, at the end of the year inflation will be 8-8,5%.</seg>
<seg id="28">Plato Магута, managing assets of the Fund Магута "</seg>
<seg id="29">An external factor associated with sanctions against Russia, while successfully contained, but if there is a further increase of the pressure, first of all, the financial sector - this can lead to a certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations, which are traditionally in purchases of currency to protect their savings.</seg>
<seg id="30">It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance will try to smooth the weakening of the ruble, as a market, and government regulation.</seg>
<seg id="31">But prices traditionally begins after a lull over the summer and, possibly, this fall will become more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="32">The target level of consumer inflation in Russia, 7.5%, most likely, a weapon, as Russia has another financial savings.</seg>

<seg id="15">"As regards the proposed settlements on the constructive elements, but in practice this is difficult to light, as well as in the construction of buildings often use different technologies," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is no secret that стройрынок develops, thanks largely to the госзаказу.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the Chairman of the Management Board of the NP Экспертное "community" Catherine Лезиной procurement professionals, today the state is the most effective.</seg>
<seg id="18">Deputy director of the pharmaceutical industry ’ s centre of capital construction Vladimir Malakhov drew attention to the fact that the market can be divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and the company that owns монопольными competence and does not allow for this field of competitors.</seg>
<seg id="19">He believes that the creation of a transparent market only if, when access to contracts will be as Turkey manager from someone's impact.</seg>
<seg id="20">The expert council was asked to form a government in such a way that one and the same performer may not receive more than one contract worth more than $1 billion rubles, or several contracts worth more than $1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="21">In минстрое believe that this approach must be evaluated from the point of view of the impact on the business, as well as the efficiency of the management of the construction.</seg>
<seg id="22">As explained by Elena Zhukova, in this case, you will need to endow customer functions, which will lead to an increase in the number of customer and budgetary expenditure on its content.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the same time, specialists will have the knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by contractors, as well as their security.</seg>
<seg id="24">Often this will be by the need to determine who will be responsible for the security of an object as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of highly skilled members of the state in connection with the new leadership in the state for part-time work and a small amount of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="26">The deputy head of the Institute of procurement экспертно-консультационного Alexander Евсташенков believes that right now, the government has turned to business to Scor.</seg>
<seg id="27">And this example: "When filling out the application should specify" specific performance "without specifying the words" or equivalent "," should "," "," "more," "less than," "similar" "or", "type", "type", not a "lower," "lower," "higher," "can," "may," "might," "earlier" and "not previously," "higher," "not allowed" and so on.</seg>
<seg id="28">Thus, customers often abused their right to establish requirements for the content of applications, of contractors.</seg>
<seg id="29">Another problem, according to 44-ФЗ Евсташенкова, was the need to assess the application of the "paper" proposal.</seg>
<seg id="30">Considering the application, you can really only assess the qualifications of contractors, but not the quality of the work, the implementation of which is not even began cooking, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="31">The quality of the works can be assessed only on their acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="32">The experts also were asked to take a margin on income from the top to the lower echelon to intermediate contractors.</seg>
<seg id="33">Chairman of the Board, and espionage expert at FAS Andrei Цариковский believes that it should not, as responsible for the order should генподрядчик.</seg>
<seg id="34">But otherwise, as in the famous репризе of Arkady Raikin normalises sleeping: "Пуговицам claims to have?"</seg>

<seg id="3">The 18th century since the building has not changed, if not considered ветхость.</seg>
<seg id="4">Strangers here, as people go on tour, and residents are suffering more than delighted, from his privilege - the right to live in the house, the walls of which price старейшем remember commander Alexander Suvorov.</seg>
<seg id="5">The date of construction of the house, amongst others, historians point to the two dates - 1730 and 1737.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in any case, it turns out that the nearly 300 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The old yard, always open the door, the squeaky staircase.</seg>
<seg id="8">Doors in the apartments are located near each other, the chair covers were cracked walls and peeling plaster просветы places visible from the street.</seg>
<seg id="9">It seems that all the honest word.</seg>
<seg id="10">But local residents are told: "You don't think it is."</seg>
<seg id="11">Live in a wooden house of the 18th century, it is very difficult, "says Tatiana (1961, a resident of apartment # 3.</seg>
<seg id="12">The object is to госохране, but its contents are not allocated the money for dozens of years, and we feel museum exhibits, about which the authorities simply have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">The last renovation was 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The walls are still performing well, though with great difficulties, but the foundation of the entire прогнил.</seg>
<seg id="15">Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, and моются once a week in a public bath.</seg>
<seg id="16">How can we be content in such conditions?</seg>
<seg id="17">The road passes directly under the windows, even a pedestrian zone.</seg>
<seg id="18">The curtain will put off.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now you can see what before was only heard: It is under the windows of the vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="20">You see, glass дребезжат constantly, can't open a window, and got used to the noise.</seg>
<seg id="21">A man gets used to the same, for good and bad.</seg>
<seg id="22">Our apartment is still a top, thanks to her husband, hands him gold.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, two rooms, three of them live with her son.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for other families, the conditions are much worse on the second floor, in a little more than one and a half meters tall ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="25">In contrast to Tatiana offers guests the roommate out of the apartment, No. 6 Lyudmila Старостиной.</seg>
<seg id="26">Us woman on the threshold of a cup of coffee and with a sad smile said:</seg>
<seg id="27">We have a one-bedroom apartment, 14.5 m ² for four people, and we live with my husband and daughter, with her granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="28">I am here with the birth, another housing was not never, "Lyudmila обводит eyes 3028-IV room: Sofa, two of the letter" g "; one of them was granddaughter with a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="29">Very closely and differs little from a domestic interior: Only ceilings, beautiful "historical."</seg>
<seg id="30">But with the ceiling regularly flows: Tap system doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lyudmila said about his apartment and at the same time, as the phone is Italian, the house which stands on the Roman ruins.</seg>
<seg id="32">They have brought in a very old and recent, everyday and legendary:</seg>
<seg id="33">Water spent about 40 years ago during the last repair.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the same time, we have a small kitchen and bathroom in закутке from former self-struggles.</seg>
<seg id="35">We live in a time where квартировал Demidov, the family lived on the second floor of a servant.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our apartment is privatized, and why?</seg>
<seg id="37">The median real estate, the privatization of meaning.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still get only apartment, can't apply for more.</seg>
<seg id="39">Already four months ago, promised us расселить, but promises it will not matter.</seg>
<seg id="40">Not used to complain and I will not.</seg>
<seg id="41">In this apartment (room!) lived for an entire dynasty: My grandparents, my mom and dad, I'm with my husband and my daughter, with her granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="42">Things happened during that time.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, the doorbell rats ran in the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="44">Look at the walls, they флигеля one-meter wide thickness.</seg>
<seg id="45">They say the solution was involved in eggs, so long rests.</seg>
<seg id="46">The house built thoroughly Демидовым, thank you.</seg>
<seg id="47">Perhaps, but so far no one killed a crumbling battlement сваей or ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="48">Only construction still slowly dying in front of us on the boards, and the logs, floors are rotting house repeatedly failed, pouring cement, but all in vain - the solution is in the ground, as well.</seg>
<seg id="49">They say and have, under our room the concealed лаз and move to the river White, who had once lived here, the old Believers to hide from danger, in which case.</seg>
<seg id="50">They also pursued.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lyudmila Allard said to him came as a historian, he begged, he began to shoot in the flat excavations.</seg>
<seg id="52">And then urged to give them housing space in exchange for its однушку in October.</seg>
<seg id="53">Lyudmila historian refused:</seg>
<seg id="54">Where are we over однушку?</seg>
<seg id="55">And here at least a tiny hope is that will give housing.</seg>
<seg id="56">We agree on the exchange, would not have won.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, the family Старостиных nothing won.</seg>
<seg id="58">The biggest dream, Ludmila расселили, and daughter with one 16-year-old granddaughter gave a separate room.</seg>
<seg id="59">The two families have identified two-room apartment instead of the majestic ruins, in which two generations living now.</seg>
<seg id="60">Pretty girl, and Olesya Карсакова from No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.</seg>
<seg id="61">They squeezed closer in two of 23 m ², referred to as apartments, lives with her large family.</seg>
<seg id="62">We just seven people, two of them children.</seg>
<seg id="63">See for yourself what conditions.</seg>
<seg id="64">Your butt falls off pieces of plaster and window frames, the walls in the kitchen, and the cross-cutting holes.</seg>
<seg id="65">The water in the кране only cold year round.</seg>
<seg id="66">Walking about the apartments in the old house, so you can make sure that the most fortunate of spouses Lavrentyev apartment No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="67">They are the most spacious rooms of the first floor.</seg>
<seg id="68">You are right, a lot of places.</seg>
<seg id="69">The 75 square, directed by three people.</seg>
<seg id="70">We live in those rooms, where legend has it stopped Suvorov during his stay in Ufa, the head of the family, "said Aleksandr Dmitrievich Lavrentyev.</seg>
<seg id="71">High ceilings, spacious.</seg>
<seg id="72">One bad - all around the train wreck that is collapsing, falling apart at the seams.</seg>
<seg id="73">Neighbors probably already told.</seg>
<seg id="74">The more suffering we have with floors, wooden boards сгнили, literally went from under the feet of the ground.</seg>
<seg id="75">I put подпорки, wedges; in another, while in another room, as we walk on a seesaw качаемся, so all you can.</seg>
<seg id="76">The merchant's house Евдокима Демидова Aleksandr Dmitrievich can tell you better than any guide.</seg>
<seg id="77">The золотопромышленнику refers to both native, speaks of it with admiration.</seg>
<seg id="78">Indeed, the personality and the owner was fantastic: Кагинского Узянского plants built houses, отливал guns and bells, kept Romani mines.</seg>
<seg id="79">Merchants take pride in an ancestor of real estate heirs, but live under one roof with history.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am settled here, even as a child, in the 1940s, the 20th century, "said Aleksandr Dmitrievich.</seg>
<seg id="81">Then, standing around a wooden room for карет, barn and sentry boxes, subsequently снесенные.</seg>
<seg id="82">In 1968, wanted to remove, and our home, but something prevented.</seg>
<seg id="83">The same story was repeated again in 2014: Поманили new housing.</seg>
<seg id="84">We, as a team, gathered all the necessary documents, обегали, and suddenly learned that moving into apartments in 2015 or 2016.</seg>
<seg id="85">Something already doesn't believe in all this....</seg>
<seg id="86">Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan, to learn the fate of their homes.</seg>
<seg id="87">Officials of the occupier was not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="88">Sent from one desk to another, but then, as mockery, given without signing a piece of paper and printing: "The Ministry of Culture is not objecting to the resettlement of tenants."</seg>
<seg id="89">Even though I have a feeling that our house for a long time in terms of the city, because he was under the number 57, then became 57 A, now 57 / 1.</seg>
<seg id="90">As if it was demolished in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="91">"A planet" to the head of the User sector of land resources Ufa Vladimir Барабашу.</seg>
<seg id="92">A house on the street of the October Revolution, 57 / 1 is included in the resettlement of the old housing.</seg>
<seg id="93">I can't be responsible for the actions of the officials of the 1970s, only know that at the time there was a plan for the demolition of old buildings, despite the historical significance.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the authorities - to restore all the ancient home of the October Revolution, representing architectural value, "successfully.</seg>
<seg id="95">Tenants in the planned new расселить apartments.</seg>
<seg id="96">According to Барабаша, restore Демидова House will be Italian experts who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="97">Now Italy is architectural, and project "Old Ufa" presented there in the other.</seg>
<seg id="98">I hope that by 2016 all former Old Kazan street will be best Western Hotel Tigra was renovated, "said the official.</seg>
<seg id="99">Home will be the appearance, which was earlier, three centuries ago.</seg>
<seg id="100">The house Демидова, is likely to become a museum, open to all comers.</seg>
<seg id="101">In addition, at ministerial level the decision to make the street at the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="102">On weekdays, unfortunately, don't get too much workload of roads in the city.</seg>
<seg id="103">People from the future museum расселить Vladimir Барабаш promises in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="104">However, it is unlikely that they will be happy with their new apartments will be of the same area, and that the current.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lenny Henry: My father ever hugging me.</seg>
<seg id="2">Never say, "I love you"</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was one of seven children born to a family of immigrants from Jamaica in Dudley in Мидлендс in 1958.</seg>
<seg id="4">His father, who died when Henry was 19, he worked in a factory, and their relationship has been limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry preparing comedy, "Rudi Редкие record," which is partially based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of programmes on Radio 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mix of 199.4 and rap, and melodies - жизнерадостны.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, Henry had to get through some difficult memories of childhood.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the death of his mother was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often mused about the relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was very inaccessible.</seg>
<seg id="10">You never saw his face, you only hear his voice: "Don't make noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Отстань from sisters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Шевелись!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch the cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were older, when I was a kid, walked with him in the pub and talk about such things as a form of attack, you beauty.</seg>
<seg id="15">I have never talked with him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was so неулыбчивым guy in the corner, which was a big part of my life.</seg>
<seg id="17">Henry opened the studio recently литейную in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in the days of his father, he was able to look at what must have been his life.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now there's a little bit better, but it's a dark, deep, have дымные Sheol with outbreaks of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father залезал in a bathtub and just lay there, and you have heard, as he slowly begins to sing about himself, because he wanted to отмыться mould from the studio.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I came back, I realised that he was doing this for years and years to get us to the other, and I began to appreciate it more.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nevertheless, Henry came from a childhood devoid of parental love.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never cuddled, never said, "I love you."</seg>
<seg id="23">It was only when her mother became ill at the end of her life, we started to talk: "I love you, I love you, I love you.</seg>
<seg id="24">The birth of her own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love with which he lacked as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">You can stop it, "I love you"?</seg>
<seg id="26">Just don't hug me.</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I'm 22.</seg>
<seg id="28">With Dawn French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why would I not be friends with her?</seg>
<seg id="30">She's a great mother</seg>
<seg id="31">They are still great friends with the French, to whom he was married for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="32">Don is a good man.</seg>
<seg id="33">Why would I not be friends with Don?</seg>
<seg id="34">She's a great mom.</seg>
<seg id="35">Henry was the mother of the diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="36">He was the one that killed her.</seg>
<seg id="37">So, when I was very, very recovered and I had symptoms of diabetes, and my doctor said, "You have to take radical measures.</seg>
<seg id="38">Then I began serious training фитенсом, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="40">And it's boring.</seg>
<seg id="41">No one eats carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">The career trajectories of Henry reflected, perhaps, in his noble, briefly подстриженной beard.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he received the recognition for his critics of Othello, he completely immersed in theatre.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Комедия errors followed," and then "guest" Огаста Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">This work is different from sitcoms and comedies that were неотъемлимым attribute his busy professional life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He started his career, when he was 16 and had worked at the factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">DJ noticed, as he parodies on the stage, and wrote about it in "new faces."</seg>
<seg id="48">His career in television began in the mid seventies: "Quite a long time I was the only black пародистом / first on television."</seg>
<seg id="49">He learned on the job.</seg>
<seg id="50">I not only had to grow in the eyes of the public, I had to learn how to be an efficient vehicle for the delivery of jokes between 1975 and 1985, as a star, working on TV, and it was very hard.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny in the 'New faces "in 1975</seg>
<seg id="52">As his manager had the right to "Black and white minstrels" show, light entertainment program, in which people "чернили themselves face," Henry found that is in it for five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">My family is a very disliked.</seg>
<seg id="54">I was, like, I want to make sure this never happened to me, but I don't regret that did it.</seg>
<seg id="55">Even though it was a strange, worthy of condemnation, I worked on large sites and was working with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="56">But the fact that it was "all light entertainment awards British television classics for years and years, it was" grotesque "and the black people."</seg>
<seg id="57">Introducing characters who were abusive to black culture in the UK, and her perfume, Henry worked in alternative комедийном project in the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="58">The first season of "Show Lenny Henry" was broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as, among other things, the chef Гэрет Блэклок from the comedy series "Biased!."</seg>
<seg id="59">Commercials, documentaries, television series and roles in films took the following ten years of his life, but after his series on the BBC in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "what are you going to do next, Len, because a little, it seems that you're тянешь time or gradually сворачиваешь aside."</seg>
<seg id="60">Next was a series of documentary broadcasts on Radio 4 called "What the...?"</seg>
<seg id="61">The first was about Шекспире.</seg>
<seg id="62">I was a genuine allergy to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">You cannot say to me adequately taught this at school, and I thought that it was, in many ways, a prerogative of white middle-class people with колготками and cabbage at the bottom of the front.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I was very afraid of him.</seg>
<seg id="65">Everything, from whom we took in an interview, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Денч said: "You have to try.</seg>
<seg id="66">Not ругай it, as long as you don't know what you are talking about.</seg>
<seg id="67">Произнеси aloud some of these words, and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry read 20 rows last monologue from Othello for the documentary, and his зацепило.</seg>
<seg id="69">I have the feeling that I can do it.</seg>
<seg id="70">It's like my head выправили.</seg>
<seg id="71">"That's what it is, this is a serious case, Treat seriously high-end, its text, conduct a study.</seg>
<seg id="72">So, the process of rehearsal was tough, and I read this play for months and months before we got her.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">It seemed that they had been waiting for disaster, but it has not happened.</seg>
<seg id="75">Soon we began Комедию "mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I was at the National Theatre, and I just could not believe it until the end.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you have changed."</seg>
<seg id="78">A technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his job is to entertain the public.</seg>
<seg id="79">"Quiet voice inside of me said:" You have to work 10 minutes until they are computer operations. "</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead, assistant director, announced that the idea will resume as soon as the problem will be solved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I walked away from the scene and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."</seg>
<seg id="82">It's not my responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can't let someone else deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="84">"You play to play, stay in the role."</seg>
<seg id="85">Henry in "заборах Дачесс in theatre."</seg>
<seg id="86">Learn the "Заборов" was difficult.</seg>
<seg id="87">Panic is quite useful, it strengthens muscle.</seg>
<seg id="88">It was good, too, so it was like a sign showing: "Here's what you need to do."</seg>
<seg id="89">He says it is, of course, Громовым voice.</seg>
<seg id="90">So I держусь.</seg>
<seg id="91">I really love it.</seg>
<seg id="92">I love being in the репетиционном hall.</seg>
<seg id="93">By the way, Henry is still thinking comedian - all the way our conversation перебивают flashes of his humour, but when he starts, it finishes to parody.</seg>
<seg id="94">I just decided not to work in стендапе, because this thing with instant gratification from a room full of strangers, I think, quite dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="95">If you try to do all the time, this can lead to a standstill.</seg>
<seg id="96">I sometimes work in "Прямом broadcast in Apollo, when I want, but, in the main, I don't get so much pleasure as before.</seg>
<seg id="97">I ask whether he will give стендапа tour ever.</seg>
<seg id="98">The joy of sitting in a room with the director, who helps shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I ever wanted it to.</seg>
<seg id="99">This is his new incarnation?</seg>
<seg id="100">I think so.</seg>
<seg id="101">I like to be an actor.</seg>
<seg id="102">It's pretty fun.</seg>
<seg id="103">You always tell a story, and a great place to do this.</seg>
<seg id="104">I love history.</seg>
<seg id="105">People love stories.</seg>

<seg id="12">It was like a cottage from the children's book, while at the same time frightening and enchanting, with a garden full of secrets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Opinion of the author: Howard Джейкобсон, whose novel "J" is included in the лонг-лист Букеровской premiums in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">The shortlist will be announced next week</seg>
<seg id="15">Кеверн Эйлинн and sat, holding hands, broken sun loungers in the high grass, enjoying surprisingly warm spring day; they both "connected to your console, which provided cheap country music and appeasing 3-zmianowy news when, looking at the crossed brown legs, he remembered the old song long forgotten black performer, which he loved to listen to his father, and curtains in the house.</seg>
<seg id="16">You are too big.</seg>
<seg id="17">In view of the inherent aggressiveness, the type of songs to the console will no longer lose.</seg>
<seg id="18">They were not banned - nothing in fact was not allowed - just not to lose.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have become, as the very word архаичными "archaic."</seg>
<seg id="20">Public taste did what would never have achieved orders and regulations, and, as people choose among books of memoirs of the rich, staying in poverty, cookbooks and love the novels, of all the music they chose ballads.</seg>

<seg id="23">"It was popular to jazz pianist named Фэтс Уоллер", he told her, automatically placing two fingers to his lips.</seg>
<seg id="24">So did his father to stop the letter "J" before she слетит with his lips.</seg>

<seg id="27">Start with the word "J," forgetting put two fingers to his mouth, and it will cost you a penny.</seg>
<seg id="28">It was not a very funny game then, and it was not very fun right now.</seg>
<seg id="29">He knew that from him for this, that's all.</seg>
<seg id="30">He had to explain what is jazz.</seg>
<seg id="31">Эйлинн never heard.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jazz is playing, even though he was not explicitly prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="33">Improvisation went out of fashion.</seg>
<seg id="34">In life, there was only one place "if."</seg>
<seg id="35">When the music started, people wanted to know exactly where it will end.</seg>
<seg id="36">With wit in exactly the same way.</seg>
<seg id="37">His unpredictability was on people's nerves.</seg>

<seg id="39">Even though he has reached the age of 10 years, never слышав about Sammy Дэвисе Младшем Кеверн, knew about the jazz from the paternal полусекретной коллеции CDs.</seg>
<seg id="40">But at least he did not have to speak Эйлинн that Фэтс Уоллер was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">Given her age, it is unlikely that she remembered a time when popular singers were not black.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again, there are no laws or pressure.</seg>
<seg id="43">Society was docile, and this meant that each segment agreed with gratitude - the gratitude of those spared the fate of the principle of group capital.</seg>

<seg id="48">Each according to his abilities.</seg>
<seg id="49">As she had heard only Эйлинн ballads, it was hard to understand how offensive the word, who had just sung her Кеверн, could be set to music.</seg>
<seg id="50">Music is an expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">"They are not really offensive," said Кеверн.</seg>
<seg id="52">Except, maybe, for people who have great legs.</seg>
<seg id="53">My father have never offended, but he loved this song.</seg>
<seg id="54">He said too much, but you gave him the illusion of security.</seg>

<seg id="56">Эйлинн still did not understand.</seg>
<seg id="57">As your father could love this?</seg>
<seg id="58">He wanted to say that it was a joke, but he never wanted it with two fingers to his lips again прижимать.</seg>
<seg id="59">She already thought it strange.</seg>
<seg id="60">"It was funny," he said instead.</seg>

<seg id="64">"Well, if you say so," she said, in his opinion.</seg>

<seg id="80">Attempts by the joke often made him awkward situation, because, like his father, he was missing the soothing charm that could mitigate the cruelty, крывшуюся? Jokes in.</seg>
<seg id="81">Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.</seg>
<seg id="82">Could be, and he, like Кеверн.</seg>
<seg id="83">Despite the good eye.</seg>
<seg id="84">Эйлинн Соломонз she blushed and stood up with the push of a console and Strait опрокинув wine that they drank.</seg>
<seg id="85">The wine's intoxication, so that he could not serve as an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="86">In his excitement, it seemed, was as пальмовые leaves in the weather system.</seg>
<seg id="87">"And you, I like you very much because you have a stupid head," she said.</seg>
<seg id="88">Although not like you very much.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was sorry for her and because of the excessive brutality of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she gave it to him.</seg>
<seg id="90">Whether she thought that he hit her?</seg>
<seg id="91">She has not talked to him about life in the cold of the northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that, in basic terms, it was like a здешнюю.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same huge icy ocean struck on both of them.</seg>
<seg id="93">The same man, and even more sensitive and capricious after that happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened than their ancestors, smugglers and разрушители, shopped in fury from pub to pub, ready to raise a hand on any woman, посмевшую refuse them or upset them.</seg>
<seg id="94">Stupid head?</seg>
<seg id="95">They would have shown her a fist, if she was not cautious.</seg>
<seg id="96">First kissed, kiss would now become the most common erotic expression of irritation between a man and a woman; an antidote from fresh ballads, too, which Google is the first kiss her, and then hit.</seg>
<seg id="97">Excessive clarification, according to Кеверна because the kiss itself was already DVD films.</seg>
<seg id="98">Эйлинн Соломонз case showed that he needs to leave.</seg>
<seg id="99">He got up from the push, as an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She herself felt the lead weight, but the weight of his grief surprised her.</seg>
<seg id="101">This was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They barely knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">She looked, as he goes from an upper window and looked, as he leaves, her companion, a man, himself the burden взваливший.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam, a garden, she thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">She felt a stab of sympathy towards him and men in general, even though some of them and raised her hand.</seg>
<seg id="106">The man, from the pulpit, отвернувшийся back пристыженный, knight, the ability to fight left him - why she felt she knew so well, and if she could not recall a single case, until today, when she saw this?</seg>
<seg id="107">Again one Эйлинн Соломонз looked at their feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">In the twenty years prior to the above events or so Эсме Нуссбаум, an intelligent and energetic 32-летняя исследовательница who worked in "Офнау", an informal service control over Community mood, has prepared a report on the low and medium levels of violence in most parts of the country, where it was expected that it will be reduced, if not lifted entirely, given the money and power, which have been allocated to its eradication.</seg>
<seg id="109">"A lot has been done, and a lot is being done," she wrote, "in order to allay врожденную aggressiveness of people who fought in a war and won most of them, especially among these спутанных branches and narrow расселин area, where, despite the saw изгородями spires of churches above, gentle breath of human kindness was rarely in history.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, some quality, it turns out, неискоренимы.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher the spire, it would seem, the низменнее those passions that he зарождает.</seg>
<seg id="112">The population of sheds tears over drinking, skipping a sentimental stories about преодоленных obstacles and announces its overheated belief in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness retains its firm grip in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is evidence that glare and a vile задиристость in homes, in the workplace, on roads and even in playgrounds.</seg>
<seg id="113">"If you have досадная habit of writing too much," said her supervisor, read the report as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="114">It seems to me that you should read shorter novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">Эсме Нуссбаум lowered her head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask you: You атеистка?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I think that is not obliged to answer," replied Эсме Нуссбаум.</seg>
<seg id="118">Are you gay?</seg>
<seg id="119">Эсме again insisted on his right to privacy and silence.</seg>
<seg id="120">A feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Again, silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I ask," said Luther Рабиновиц, "not because I am against atheism, лесбийства or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">There is no prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="124">We are the servants of society without prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="125">But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely reasonable and a good in themselves, they may sometimes distort the results, such as, for example, those that you showed me.</seg>
<seg id="126">It is obvious that you yourself предубеждены against the church, and what you call "malevolent" and "rude", others would be interpreted as an expression of natural and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="127">Continue нудеть about THAT happened, IF ANY ВООБЩЕ happened, as if it happened, if it happened yesterday, it means depriving the country needed her life force.</seg>
<seg id="128">Эсме Нуссбаум огляделась for parties, while Рабиновиц said.</seg>
<seg id="129">Over his head, as well as equipment, led the letter repeated advice that "Офнау" gave the country a quarter of a century or more.</seg>
<seg id="130">Улыбайся his neighbour, the energy of his spouse, listen up, walk, talk on the phone to organise, communicate, объясняй, listen, соглашайся, извиняйся.</seg>
<seg id="131">The conversation is better than silence, word of the song better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I fully understand that you want to say," quietly replied Эсме Нуссбаум, when satisfied that her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I don't want to say anything, except that he was not as effective as we convince ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">I am worried about is that if we do not we are ready, we will find that repeat mistakes, which initially led to ТОМУ ВООБЩЕ IF THAT happened, happened.</seg>
<seg id="134">Only this time we выбросим their anger and distrust the other.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Рабиновиц joined the tips of fingers in the sitting.</seg>
<seg id="136">That gesture was supposed to mean an infinite patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"You go too far," he said, "calling" mistakes "actions that made or not made our grandfathers.</seg>
<seg id="138">You go too far and when talking about the fact that they threw their "anger" and "mistrust" in the "other."</seg>
<seg id="139">The man should not need: That, in the past, the present, we are not talking about "us" and "them."</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "us" and no "other."</seg>
<seg id="141">It was the time of the disorder - and that's all we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"For that, to be honest with ourselves," ventured Эсме insert, "neither part of society may well justify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am not accusing anyone.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it's bad or good, what is done is done.</seg>
<seg id="145">Then it was back then.</seg>
<seg id="146">Nothing to say - and here we agree.</seg>
<seg id="147">And don't blame anyone, not excuses, and if this was appropriate, or if it was something to fix.</seg>
<seg id="148">But why, if we do not to learn "</seg>
<seg id="149">Past Update to ensure that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I can add to that one word -</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther's Great Pyramid Рабиновица fallen apart.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I'll review your report," he said, and dismissed her.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, on the way to work off her biker, who rode on the sidewalk, passersby, described as "a vicious rage."</seg>

<seg id="1">Manufacturing in the euro zone, the indicator, the lowest in 13 months</seg>
<seg id="2">Growth in the eurozone slowed to the lowest level in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.</seg>
<seg id="3">The business index (PMI) for the eurozone manufacturing sector of the public fell to 50.7 in August, dropping from 51.8 in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">The above 50 indicates growth.</seg>
<seg id="5">New orders and businesses affected, among them the growing tension between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The meeting came before the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Markets will wait for a clear plan from the bank, and how to cope with a recovery in the eurozone, as well as the threat of deflation, with inflation of just 0.3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi later this week may give further signals that he is contemplating the QE for the eurozone, similar to those used by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Although some growth is better than no growth, and the braking effect of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty for manufacturers is becoming more obvious," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at public.</seg>
<seg id="10">The manufacturing sector PMI in Germany, a major trade partner of Russia in the EU, has fallen to the lowest level in 11 months of an increase.</seg>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile, the second largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46,9.</seg>

<seg id="14">The industry will likely still would add fuel to the fire, analysts anticipating the introduction of additional monetary or tax-based incentives.</seg>
<seg id="15">One positive was news from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.</seg>
<seg id="16">Howard Арчер, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that can be said about the August survey index of business activity in the eurozone manufacturing sector, is that it shows that the sector is still growing."</seg>
<seg id="17">He added: "Eurozone manufacturers, obviously, are finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension - particularly associated with the Russia / Ukraine - adds uncertainty still difficult conditions in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">This increasing tension, apparently hit by business - and especially on the confidence of consumers, and is likely to lead to the fact that some orders are delayed, or even cancelled, especially large orders.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said that "more and more like the fact" that the ECB, of course, will have to conduct some kind of quantitative easing, "although we suspect that it will be limited."</seg>

<seg id="51">I remember right after that I threw all their игрушечное weapons.</seg>
<seg id="52">But I can now play computer games with shooting, and it's not a problem for me.</seg>
<seg id="53">"I am not afraid to go back in the gym, but I didn't think about herself.</seg>
<seg id="54">I remember those kids with whom I played in the yard, which has not escaped.</seg>
<seg id="55">We would never say that they killed or dead.</seg>
<seg id="56">We say that they stayed in the gym.</seg>
<seg id="57">I remember my trip to London so well, especially in a toy shop, where I was allowed to choose what I wanted, and travel in a car with an open top.</seg>
<seg id="58">But now he is afraid for such places as Ukraine, where a war to have such a grief that he and his friends.</seg>
<seg id="59">This horror comes back to you every day, but I would like to think that I could no longer remember his</seg>
<seg id="60">"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who in the past week, doing volunteer work in a women's monastery.</seg>
<seg id="61">I want to help.</seg>
<seg id="62">I want to serve in the police and I hope one day that included me in training academy in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="63">His mother, Tamara, 48, said: "37 children, have been killed in this quarter, you can imagine?</seg>
<seg id="64">I remember the silence immediately after their capture, there are simply no children who would have screamed and ran around, and the silence lasted for many months.</seg>
<seg id="65">She vividly remembers his trip with Дамиром in London.</seg>
<seg id="66">People in London cried when I told our story.</seg>
<seg id="67">I realized then, as people on the other end of the earth can understand our feelings, can support.</seg>
<seg id="68">She was grateful to "global and its Fund for the award and the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="69">I would like to call the Sheri and her just to say that 10 years have passed, but I still remember a meeting with her and her husband in London and how they helped Дамиру and me.</seg>
<seg id="70">I remember when Damir wanted to eat, they rang up all the local Russian restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="71">I remember how he played with the waiters in the restaurant, Damir shot them from his water pistol, and they flee and played with him.</seg>
<seg id="72">And only one month has passed since then our nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="73">I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and to support us.</seg>
<seg id="74">She said: "I still think that this world was no better over these 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="75">Now in Ukraine there is a war, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been killed and would be killed.</seg>
<seg id="76">It's just the same as our children.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think, for many people, war is a news broadcast, that they listen to when they get bored or when they are busy with something else.</seg>
<seg id="78">I just know that these people feel, the horror of it.</seg>
<seg id="79">And I can't stop feeling it.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.</seg>
<seg id="81">Damir grew up and became very soft and quiet as a boy, he's quite aggressive and angry.</seg>
<seg id="82">He is not looking for revenge, for example, it is not just fixed on it in this last nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not like to remember it, but they are very close with six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and burn candles.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was younger, he suffered from this, I remember, as he lay on the couch, facing away from us, for hours on end.</seg>
<seg id="85">Do not sleep, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys. Дамиру now 17, he was above me, nice, smart and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that a few hours I was so sure that he is dead and that I never see more.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I was able to recover from the explosion and rose to his feet, I огляделась, I saw hell around when parts of bodies were lying everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely convinced that it is not possible to my little boy could survive in this hell.</seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember what I shouted to him:" Damir, Run, убегай ", but again I was so sure that he had not heard me.</seg>
<seg id="91">But he heard, and ran off.</seg>
<seg id="92">So life goes on for us, unlike so many others.</seg>
<seg id="93">Giorgi, 17 years</seg>
<seg id="94">The boy, whose shocking photo after capture was decisive for the Beslan tragedy</seg>
<seg id="95">Peace: Surviving Beslan Georgy Ilyin with his mum Фатимой after taking over in 2004, and to the right of Georgy today</seg>
<seg id="96">On his bloody face was coloured by fear when they were fleeing from death, when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.</seg>
<seg id="97">His photo was one of the most shocking character barbarism in Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="98">His mother Fatima, 54, the chief doctor, enrolled him in school in the first day of school before the eldest son to Vladimir in university.</seg>
<seg id="99">"I went away for two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so that my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmare," she recalled.</seg>
<seg id="100">Not just one, there was the family of our relatives, but they were all killed.</seg>
<seg id="101">Only my at managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="102">The closer the date, the more difficult to think and talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="103">There is not a single day when we won't remember this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="104">We do not think that it was a long time ago, I think that is what happened yesterday, some scenes these days all the time, right before my eyes.</seg>
<seg id="105">No one will never forget, I promise you.</seg>
<seg id="106">Западает in soul: George (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was увековечена in sculpture (right)</seg>
<seg id="107">I remember that, George, so he wanted to go to school that day, said that a teacher who wants to embrace.</seg>
<seg id="108">I only found out that he was alive when I saw him on TV.</seg>
<seg id="109">And now even have the sculpture crying George in San Marino.</seg>
<seg id="110">George doesn't like to look at this picture, and she was hidden in the closet at home.</seg>
<seg id="111">I understand, but I also think that the photos of people from all over the world are feeling the pain.</seg>
<seg id="112">George says now: "It is important that this never happened.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I doubt that we ever learn the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">People continue to investigate this tragedy and will never know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">Now they are investigating the collapse of Boeings in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Will we ever know what it was?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world is going to be something very bad.</seg>
<seg id="118">"I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, because it is happening?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing for this pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need to have a little bit of tens of years to forget it.</seg>
<seg id="121">It has affected my health, and I still feel it.</seg>
<seg id="122">About three or four years of nightmares because of me, but now it became better.</seg>
<seg id="123">I returned to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.</seg>
<seg id="124">I thought about my friends and одноклассниках who have been killed.</seg>
<seg id="125">That's why I keep going to the gym before every September 1.</seg>
<seg id="126">I would like to pay tribute to the memory of my old childhood friends.</seg>
<seg id="127">I find it difficult to enter the gym, but I must do this.</seg>
<seg id="128">I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.</seg>
<seg id="129">I didn't forget about it, but I'm not feeling sorry for ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="130">My life goes on.</seg>
<seg id="131">I graduated from high school this year and enrolled in the Medical University in Vladikavkaz.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'll learn to become кардиохирургом.</seg>
<seg id="133">My first choice was to go into the army.</seg>

<seg id="137">The boy, who survived, despite the fact that he was at the feet of террориста-убийцы</seg>
<seg id="138">Incredible: George Фарниев was at the feet of террориста-убийцы during capture, but still he managed to survive</seg>
<seg id="139">At the time, he was in the gym catre sitting next to the bomb at the feet of террориста-убийцы.</seg>
<seg id="140">Indeed, it is a miracle that he was not killed.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It seems to us that it was yesterday," says Giorgi, who wanted to study the intelligence officer in the Federal Security Service (FSB), but couldn't because of the damage that was caused by his health at the time of capture.</seg>
<seg id="142">It's still with me, this is not something that I left behind.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am older now, and they say that children can easily cope with bad events, I must say that this is not true.</seg>
<seg id="144">"In 2006 I worked with psychologists, and I felt a bit better after that, but I can't forget it.</seg>
<seg id="145">And I would like to forget.</seg>
<seg id="146">In 2005, the next year - was the first and last time, when I went into the gym again.</seg>
<seg id="147">I lost consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="148">I would never go there again, and, please, don't ask me to show, where I sat on this famous photograph.</seg>
<seg id="149">Person left alive: George Фарниев today with an open laptop to photograph themselves in hospital after seizure</seg>
<seg id="150">My pain is enormous, and I carry it with me every day.</seg>
<seg id="151">My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about my school.</seg>
<seg id="152">With regard to the physical condition, and I'm healthy.</seg>
<seg id="153">I need to be cautious with the knee, which was damaged, but now I'm okay.</seg>
<seg id="154">But health is not allowed me to go to study at the Academy of the Federal Security Service in St. Petersburg, as I wanted to.</seg>
<seg id="155">I sent my documents, including the medical opinions, and they said that was impossible.</seg>
<seg id="156">My second passion was animals, so I went to the institute.</seg>
<seg id="157">I studied there for two years.</seg>
<seg id="158">He learns to treat all animals, from cats to cows. "</seg>
<seg id="159">He said: "I know that would never tell their children about their experience.</seg>
<seg id="160">It is not what children should know, and, of course, is not what they need to survive.</seg>
<seg id="161">His mother, Marina, 42, said: "The pain never leaves me.</seg>
<seg id="162">She's in my soul, and worse, when the anniversary is approaching.</seg>
<seg id="163">I will go and will attend the ceremonies, which will be held, to celebrate her.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know that George did not go.</seg>
<seg id="165">For him it should be even stronger, because he was there, and I'm not.</seg>
<seg id="166">I was waiting for him at home, and could not help.</seg>
<seg id="167">I am so grateful to God that he came back to me... Here, in Beslan print lies on each.</seg>
<seg id="168">He remains with us.</seg>
<seg id="169">George, now an adult, but the nightmare was still with him.</seg>
<seg id="170">It's hard to take when something so terribly unfair, happens to you.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was a boy, he loves the sport, but he can't do because of the knee.</seg>
<seg id="172">He had several operations, he can walk, but he can't exercise.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say that the 50% he overcame this nightmare, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.</seg>
<seg id="174">This eerie experience will remain with us.</seg>
<seg id="175">Many of my friends and neighbors had been killed during the capture, and this only reinforces my pain.</seg>
<seg id="176">I lost a lot of people who I knew well and who were dear to me.</seg>
<seg id="177">My son with me, and this is the best gift that God could I do, but my heart aches for those who had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know the family, where the children were born, but I know and widows who never married.</seg>
<seg id="179">It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.</seg>
<seg id="180">I will never forget how heart выпрыгнуло out of my chest at that moment, when I saw him in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="181">Now I look at what is happening in the world, "the war in different regions.</seg>
<seg id="182">These people are fighting for that?</seg>
<seg id="183">Why are they killing each other?</seg>
<seg id="184">The war is very close to our country right now, and I can hardly believe it.</seg>
<seg id="185">We were a close-knit country in the past, that we are fighting now?</seg>
<seg id="186">Men and children are suffering, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine, and many will be killed.</seg>
<seg id="187">If you could grab all the rebels and throw away - far away, as soon as you can.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips, how to achieve a better quality of underwater photos and video</seg>
<seg id="2">If you want to take pictures or shoot video under water, you have a number of options.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option, is a waterproof "Point and Shoot," for example, the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or, for example, GoPro Hero3 экшн-камера + Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I took these pictures on a family holiday with the help of a few cameras, all for the price of about $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">No matter what equipment you are using, you need to comply with several regulations, in order to achieve the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Перепроверяйте their equipment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera case and other branches of the tightly closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, set up their camera for the type of photos or videos that you shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some photos and video cameras filming or object type is regimes that optimise exposure for затемненных underwater conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in the water, notice how deeply your equipment can fall.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are only 5 feet, others - 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Look at our leadership and the ratings of digital cameras for both traditional and водонепроницаемых models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Remove a few frames - because many of them never get.</seg>
<seg id="14">The "point" have LCD, which lets you assign images, whereas the экшн-камер them usually don't.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have LCD, it will be difficult to see under the water, and the layout is a random process.</seg>
<seg id="16">So do a few frames.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also, if your camera is serial shooting mode, which takes several shots with slightly different plant, use them.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">The amount of light is significantly reduced, the deeper you нырнете under water.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, stay at the surface, when you're shooting in a swimming pool, a river or ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">It will also allow you to transfer more colors in the photos, the deeper the color, the less you can see.</seg>
<seg id="22">Подплывайте closer to objects.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is excellent advice for shooting on the land, but it is even more important under the water because of затемненных light conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is especially important if you're shooting on экшн-камеру: This equipment often comes with a fixed, широкоугольной lens, which means that you have to get closer to the object of filming, if you want to fill the frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was such a man, whose force of personality could shake things around, even in such a giant organization like the National Health Service.</seg>
<seg id="2">Консультирующий anaesthetist, he has devoted his career as former patients suffering from the disease, and of encouraging treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among those who spoke to him, recalls his wife, MI-6 officer who had to live with devastating effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that as long as doctors about being diagnosed and diseases, those on medication, mostly worried about something else -- the pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, however, he appeared to those who suffer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I never felt, as usual," he wrote in May last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I found it hard to find strength in herself.</seg>
<seg id="8">Struggling with symptoms similar to flu, he found that irritated reproaches his wife, Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I wish it was sooner rather than later," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Juliet left for a week, Lawson found that unusual and it is not clear why he was upset.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked a colleague to chest X-rays.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks before he first went skiing in the Alps.</seg>
<seg id="14">The results of the X-rays came.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was mesothelioma, a terminal cancer, which affects плевру, or lungs.</seg>
<seg id="16">For most cancers, it is difficult to determine an exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although some people became ill with cancer of the lung, for example, not all cancer patients smoking lung.</seg>
<seg id="18">But with attributable to mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, grainy construction material, who once called a "miracle," but which, as we now know, deadly dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us is a disease of mesothelioma, which can be not to pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos, at the end of the day, "the material from the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in the UK since the 1960s, when these industrial ban came into force.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even when it has been used, only people from specific sectors worked in close contact with him: Трубоизолировщики, builders, carpenters and docks, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">Industrial toxin from another era, he is hardly seen as a cause for concern today.</seg>
<seg id="25">But such a calm.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it turns out, is now at the peak of the epidemic мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="27">Here мезотелиомы dies from more people than in any other country on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="28">The annual death rate at about 2500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease than as a result of road accidents.</seg>
<seg id="29">The annual number of deaths from мезотелиомы since 1980 and projected the number of deaths in the UK in the future</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason we feel its deadly consequences right now, lies in the fact that, although the use of asbestos it is illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), for the development of мезотелиомы go usually tens of years.</seg>
<seg id="31">And attack мезотелиомы is not limited to veterans in the industrial construction.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was, and is, in many cases, remains in the house where we live, where we work, offices, schools, shops, where we are and where we go shopping.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention in class, the level of prosperity, profession or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">Избранности bastions of London fashion department stores to private schools, as it turned out, not salvation.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parliament building is riddled with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even hospitals that are intended to treat us, turned out to be reservoirs of this deadly a carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was not трубоизолировщиком.</seg>
<seg id="39">In fact, he had to think where he might have come into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he realized.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It seems that there could be a lot of asbestos in tunnels in the hospital, where I spent six years on it," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">All are students, nurses, doctors and грузчики - used these тоннелями.</seg>
<seg id="43">I wonder how many of my peers expect the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">It was a question to which, unfortunately, he was able to give a partial response.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Of the four doctors, which we in the hospital and have subsequently Guy developed mesothelioma for the past five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I alone remained alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us expect this disease?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Лоусону was diagnosed with mesothelioma, "" when he was 48 years old.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">To live so long.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty per cent of attributable to mesothelioma patients die within 8 months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is always fatal.</seg>
<seg id="52">So, now, we can only repeat Лоусона question: "How many of us expect this disease?"</seg>
<seg id="53">According to a leading expert in the UK, Professor Джулиану мезотелиоме Пито, most likely assume that the years between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain should be an himself, dies about wealthy people.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most now are that they die that way.</seg>
<seg id="55">Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada, Alamy</seg>
<seg id="56">A quick review of reports from the halls of the court, where victims are often seek compensation, shows how far it has spread attack мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="57">In June, for example, Marks & Spencer acknowledged that the recent Джэнис Ellen contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, clothing departments at two sites, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs Ellen was just 18 years old, when she started working at M & S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now her two children over the age of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Before this happened," she says, "I have never heard about мезотелиоме, I barely knew about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="62">And in my head I could not come, it will affect me.</seg>
<seg id="63">Few people really know a lot about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="64">In fact, asbestos is not one substance, and a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">They get their name from the word "асбестиформ", which means the fibrous structure, which tells them the strength and flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="66">Of those six, three were often used in the construction.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotile, widely known as white asbestos, is much more common in other buildings today.</seg>
<seg id="68">It has been used in roofing panels, outdoor thermal insulation, boilers, pipes and toilets, even in the hold.</seg>
<seg id="69">He смертелен less than other forms of asbestos, but all the same, as the European Union and the World Health Organization "serious source of health damage," which can lead to death.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, brown asbestos (амозит) and blue asbestos (крокидолит).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that there are good, though indirect reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of cases attributable to mesothelioma [in the UK]. "</seg>
<seg id="72">At Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the main store on London's Oxford Street, Alamy</seg>
<seg id="73">Джэнис Ellen may not have thought of yourself as a victim, but Julian Пито мезотелиомы work suggests that her story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that a significant percentage of мезотелиом when there is no known exposure at work or at home, were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment. "</seg>
<seg id="75">A big part of this, he says, is "a normal use and exposure to weather" in our building.</seg>
<seg id="76">No one, it seems, can't be sure that he is safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">The report Goddard Consulting, which was in the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the heart of the government, could be exposed to unconsciously.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009, Goddard said that technical mines and pipelines for the premises of parliamentary committees were infected with deadly asbestos fibres, which may be given in the movement, something so harmless as "strong currents of air."</seg>
<seg id="79">Members of the parliament often blame the fact that they are pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.</seg>
<seg id="80">Although the Agency for maintenance of Parliament insisted that Westminster Palace received a "clean bill of health," and now she recognized that it is necessary to work on the £1 billion for the reconstruction of the parliament, by upgrading electrician and removing asbestos, and that after the general election of 2015, members of parliament, will meet in the conference centre nearby, increased and not on the green benches was.</seg>
<seg id="81">The report Goddard said that "the situation with the asbestos is not Poland, in accordance with the various rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">It is impossible to know whether this error management cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All you can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">One of those who have not managed to identify his contact with asbestos, Graham is the cost, the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson, the cost, 50 years, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I was working at the hospital, which has successfully brought claims associated with asbestos," he says, "but I can't prove this in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It's so hard to remember all the places where he worked, and the date.</seg>
<seg id="88">He remembers clearly, so this day in early December 2009, when his wholly overcame something that was like the flu.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly were shaken as me.</seg>
<seg id="91">It started very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terrible.</seg>

<seg id="94">The cost of being a doctor, knew the pain comes from the shell, including checking for iframe loads around the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="95">However, as Джэнис Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect мезотелиому.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the end, he couldn't walk for a month.</seg>
<seg id="97">The US doctors doing chest x-rays and плевральные катетеры to pull fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis.</seg>
<seg id="98">And yet his condition оставлось without a diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">Gradually, his health has improved, and he returned to work.</seg>
<seg id="100">But from time to time, those same symptoms return, often after he engaged in sports, and he breathed heavily.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, one of the patients Эбботта came to him in office with similar symptoms, and he was later diagnosed with mesothelioma. ""</seg>
<seg id="102">But even then the cost is not associated with their own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">In the end, his patient was in the tens of years older and worked with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">In this case, the connection was obvious.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011 the Эбботта deteriorated again, and showed him his doctor консультировавший results of the CT and X-ray images of the group.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, exactly two years after the cost began to feel ill, the sensor, equipped with a camera, was introduced in the cavity between the shell of his shell of his chest and lung.</seg>
<seg id="107">I'm an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I usually just go further, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="109">I'm not too upset about it, to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife was.</seg>
<seg id="111">The biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that it was mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham: Cost of mesothelioma diagnosis</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly sank in meeting the cost of the Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested he contact a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">It was then he realised the scale of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turns out that asbestos is widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos was once quite often in the pipes," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, now get sick with this disease.</seg>
<seg id="117">Thus, mesothelioma now affects more young people, atypical professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous asbestos pipes isolated in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees, who were crossing the tunnels connecting nearby landmasses can bring together, to get from one building to another (as Andrew Lawson), or ate in the basements of table (how often did Graham cost) almost certainly really were exposed to toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">For several decades after the war, as it turns out, the hospital was a place where, in theory, pulled the life for поциентов, but a place, which constituted a threat to life for doctors who treated them.</seg>
<seg id="121">It still continues to remove today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students set their burners Бунзена rotates on asbestos</seg>
<seg id="123">And it's not just hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and мэриях because of its amazing support and if characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="125">Schools too.</seg>
<seg id="126">In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the classroom for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="127">Across the country, countless chemistry lessons, students set their burners Бунзена asbestos in the cradle.</seg>
<seg id="128">There were websites, highlighting the problem of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as floor tiles or roof сараев usually contained asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"This is an industrial poison in a huge number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Лоусона Guy in a case against the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case, the only contact the woman could remember was the demolition of garden shed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So be careful, снося garden sheds.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effect of the diagnosis, when we know that the disease is incurable, is huge.</seg>
<seg id="134">"To realize it, is quite a lot of time," says Graham cost.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn't focus on what I'm doing.</seg>
<seg id="136">I spent two weeks in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I realized that I had to go and deal with them.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I don't meet Christmas</seg>
<seg id="139">One of the most difficult things was the transition from doctor to patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">As countless patients before him, he remembers, was shot down with the amount of information that had to be taken.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was difficult to understand," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked my doctor," How much do I have time? "</seg>
<seg id="143">Gave me about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember, as I thought, "Well, I'm not a Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's all. "</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, as it is the mechanics of how we are in life, "the very act of breathing, raises cancer, which kills.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases are caused by contact with asbestos мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos is composed of tiny fibers.</seg>
<seg id="149">When asbestos is being destroyed and the carcinogenic fibers, they can get stuck in плевре, shell.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibers are annoying плевру and can cause mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem is due to the inhalation of asbestos fibres matrix," Professor Tom Трежер кардиоторакальный, surgeon, who came to the hospital in 2001, Guy.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is the hospital, where, as suspected, Andrew Lawson, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="153">Трежер Лоусона knew and treated some of the others who, perhaps, was exposed to while in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">When Sally Goodin Sally goodun Etc asbestos into the lung tissue, "says Трежер, breathing their course on the periphery, where the shell.</seg>
<seg id="155">It is, in essence, invasive process from the very beginning.</seg>
<seg id="156">Conventional treatments of other forms of cancer is much less effective at мезотелиоме.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, cause hot debate.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some think that it is worth the try.</seg>
<seg id="159">Трежер disagrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">"You can't cut плевру," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">No good around her with a knife.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, this cancer chemotherapy is "not very well", which "acts", but not people.</seg>
<seg id="163">"From time to time there are patients who live a long time," says Трежер.</seg>
<seg id="164">But in the end, they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some patients are living much, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">Writer Stephen Jay Gould who died 20 years after he was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years after diagnosis, Graham cost continues to fight.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he became ill attributable to mesothelioma, Andrew Лоусоном Эбботта acquainted with that, four years after the diagnosis, single-handedly turned into office support and advice for patients.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Yes, Раковая Central," he said, cheerfully when they rang.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," says the cost.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was diagnosed four years ago, and he still is very energetic.</seg>
<seg id="172">First Эбботту offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and would have prolonged his life only a month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was in despair," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, managed to give the few a more positive agenda. "</seg>
<seg id="176">The cost of meeting with several specialists, decided to continue the treatment with Professor Лоиком Ланж-Лаздунски institutes, a professor in the hospital, Guy.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage in that I don't need it, I just called them and they took me," admits Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">Likely the patient would have to get the direction and approval for funding.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money plays a decisive role for patients with attributable to mesothelioma, to get the best available treatments.</seg>
<seg id="180">But when such treatments become ineffective, finally, inevitably, many patients are faced with a financial reason for concern "about the future of the families that they would leave.</seg>
<seg id="181">And then they turn to the courts for compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Price Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It has been known that asbestos is harmful to health, in 1898," said Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But that changed in the 1960s, it became clear that even very small amounts can put their health at risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">It was then spoke about the bad faith.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and hospital Guy, ultimately, resolve the case, but it was not "the full cost of the settlement," according to Morgan, as Lawson could not clearly prove that his mesothelioma was the result of exposure to asbestos at Guy Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation into his death, a spokesman for the hospital Guy is confirmed, however, that "asbestos in its basement, mentioned above, was removed in the 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="188">It was too late for Andrew Лоусона.</seg>
<seg id="189">How to remove asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">In fact, tie deadly contact with asbestos to one company or place of work - usually through dozens of years after that, it turned out to be a big problem for patients with attributable to mesothelioma, demanding compensation.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have the owner or shut down.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance archives could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who are protected from lawsuits, knows that time is on their side, the plaintiffs, of course, is no.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, this year took serious new legislative acts which facilitate the process of recovery attributable to mesothelioma patients with compensation, even if it is impossible to keep track of their former employers.</seg>
<seg id="195">In accordance with this law, was created by £350-миллионный fund of funds, which is financed by the insurance industry, for those who had been diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove, but who do not fight with anyone.</seg>
<seg id="196">In such cases, patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in a case about the compensation of about £pirates.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful claims under this scheme is expected to be every year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with attributable to mesothelioma, believes that the £350 million represent a "very good work" for the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"This is the deal, the companies for insurers," he says, hinting that the sum is a quarter of that, insurers would have to pay, if not intervened, with a temporary period attributable to mesothelioma sufferers would have been able to track down the company and file a lawsuit in the usual way.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even Mike Пеннинг, previously minister for work and pensions, acknowledged that the law "deficient."</seg>
<seg id="201">But Пеннинг, and Morgan acknowledged that, in view of the fact that seven people die every day, rapid action was needed.</seg>
<seg id="202">"People suffer so much, and they need help now," said Пеннинг during the second reading of the Bill about мезотелиоме in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">By the time Graham cost was in the hands of Professor Лоика Ланж-Лаздунски 19 months.</seg>
<seg id="204">After the initial consultation Ланж-Лаздунски recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Трежера, he believes.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was followed by chemotherapy and radiation for тритерапия - in which Ланж-Лаздунски can boast for 40 per cent of patients surviving for five years.</seg>
<seg id="206">The cost of felt a surge of strength.</seg>
<seg id="207">"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says the cost.</seg>
<seg id="208">You see these patients all the time.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is a force that supports you.</seg>
<seg id="210">When сдаешься, condition can deteriorate very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham went to the cost of the operation in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">By the end of August he finished last of six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">The scan showed no trace of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had a scan in March [2014].</seg>
<seg id="215">There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I just would not happen.</seg>
<seg id="217">This is not a threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="218">This is the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="219">And again, the cost went through six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now there is no trace of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="221">However, this process is both physically and emotionally heavy.</seg>
<seg id="222">You can think about practical things - about finances, and when I die, for example, or that we need to show his wife, works as a timer on a big PRB.</seg>
<seg id="223">When you get bad news, you become безрадостным.</seg>
<seg id="224">You just have to look forward.</seg>

<seg id="226">"It's hard for a parent," he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It's hard to understand, what to say and how much to say.</seg>
<seg id="228">When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had the disease, which means that I won ’ t live to old age.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose their leaders; protesters promise revenge</seg>
<seg id="2">China's parliament decided Sunday to not allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reforms.</seg>
<seg id="3">Such a move is likely to mark the beginning of long promised protests in Hong Kong as activists have begun planning and mobilization in a matter of hours after that statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the 11th National People's Congress, in fact, communist leaders to remove all the candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's not обмануло our expectations, but still leads in rage," said legislator Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's not that Beijing had promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">They lied to the people of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defending the decision of China, Li Fey, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the 11th National People's Congress, said that to allow public nomination for Hong Kong's leadership elections, it would be too "leopard skin".</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing promised to allow residents to vote by the head of the government, starting in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Sunday, Chinese leaders have taken the decision as a democratic step forward, since it gives a direct vote гонконгцам right; however, the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold in his hands with the help of the Commission on the appointment of candidates, rigidly controlled from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, according to a new article that only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision was taken after the summer, when there have been some of the most extensive and received widespread publicity the protests in Hong Kong for many years.</seg>
<seg id="14">After a big part of the campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, which threatened to cut off the financial district in Hong Kong if Beijing does not guarantee of universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday evening, a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="16">The organisers of the demonstration said that their movement is shifting to a new phase of civil disobedience and that they rise up on the waves of protest in the next few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, they have not announced details, apparently in an effort to avoid problems with the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In онлайн-заявлении organizers reported that the ability of the central district "обдумывало only as exceptional measures, steps that can be taken only if all the possibilities of the dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We regret to inform you that today, all possibilities have been exhausted and the dialogue is the central district.</seg>
<seg id="20">Authorities in Hong Kong were preparing to Beijing a few days, and on Sunday the government had strengthened security measures with the help of police and barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">The unrest is the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their own city.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">The fear is that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some have criticized the movement Occupy Central, saying that his demonstration to jeopardize the businesses - the lifeblood of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protest, which they say, it could lead to a big economic damage, depending on how many people will participate, and how long," said lawmaker Regina Yip, who has long been critical of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="26">We don't want to have to worry about the fact that Hong Kong is out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This idea, which is harmful for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chinese state media also gave reports in recent days, activists of the democratic movement in Hong Kong which were shown диверсантами considering Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral law, which drew 7th - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.</seg>
<seg id="30">In July tens of thousands came out to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists brought up the issue of race and the behaviour of the police after Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">Unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Фергюсоне, Missouri, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">Coming raise hands, chanting: "Hands up, don't стреляй" while they wait in line in.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Missouri, Фергюсоне, associated with the murder of teenager Michael Brown, 45, a blogger Miriam зоила Perez noticed a shift in интернет-разговоре among white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">In her experience, the white feminists, stamps comments put gender above race, when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, as tensions grew in the Midwest and attracted national attention, Peres saw the responses of white women, which focused on 100 percent for the race.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared with the reaction of black women shortly after the killing on 9 August, personal essays with such titles as "thoughts about Фергюсоне on behalf of a white woman" and "Феминизм - it's not just about housing for women" appeared relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Perez, they demonstrated a significant shift.</seg>
<seg id="9">"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who are talking about the white color of the skin and privileges at such a high level," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People feel the need to say something about what has happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is a very symbolic for the crisis with which we are faced, and because of the situation in Фергюсоне) is so tied to the race, they felt that it should be.</seg>
<seg id="12">For Professor of English at the University of Ohio Кориты Mitchell Ferguson has laid bare problems that blacks face every day, but one which is not perceived as a "women's problems" in the cultural sphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner and get 150 лайков from everywhere," says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">When I write something about how the colored people are attacked in his own country, clearly the silence.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Why are women so publicly talk about relationships, but not about the security in the public sector?" She asks.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women, like Mitchell, who studied the issues of race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between matters relating to race and gender.</seg>
<seg id="17">From her point of view, blacks, women are in a position to clearly separate the problems; they are faced with a complex reality every day.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women now bring together issues of race and gender in feminist мейнстриме, Энджела Хэттери, a professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that its predecessor did.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 1865 and 1890 линчевали for years, at least 10,000 black men, and the ground is almost always served as the rape of white women," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="20">Need a white woman, was the story to justify Nepal.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the point of view of Хэттери, the gap between white and black women, while white суфражистки, for example, Susan B. Anthony looked at the situation in the late 1800s, and saw that the fight for suffrage will be effective only for one of the groups: Women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They decided to lay all the eggs in the basket voting rights for women, and the right to vote for blacks would appear later," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="23">Looking back on things like this gives us a clear idea of why colored women don't trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have not done anything good.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to ensure that the white women united against mob lynchings in the Women's Association for the prevention of mob lynchings in the South.</seg>
<seg id="27">This group is almost 40 years after blacks for the first time women were asked to help, said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">From the point of view of Mitchell, the reactions of white feminists on the issues raised in the conduct of the police, "Фергюсоне, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white a feminist had to" catch up "with blacks, women cope in several generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It is true, it would be great if a militant, which have such a [traditional феминистическая] ideology, would seriously for the right to educate a child as they relate to the right to contraception?" Asked Mitchell.</seg>

<seg id="32">"I hope that women who have a different, but similar, understanding the reason for the split in the body - and the point of view of the racial issues that differ in surveys of the public - will be at the head of the change," wrote Стайнем.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Стайнем is responsible for the more пересекающийся feminism, which includes and issues of race and gender, her comments about race in America still fascinate some.</seg>
<seg id="34">Researcher Christina Соммерс American entrepreneurial Institute, is the author of "Who stole feminism?," she said She The People that young men in the United States, and especially young people of color, "are much more vulnerable than their sisters," but the value Стайнем Фергюсоне contrary to criticism, which she previously clear.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for the boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">But when the White House has recently initiated a programme, "Сторож to my brother," in order to help the vulnerable black and young men, followed the испаноговорящим changed remarkably from the many feminists, including Gloria Стайнем.</seg>
<seg id="37">Police relationship with the black community is not the only problem, продвигающая helm of traditional feminism.</seg>
<seg id="38">After the U.S. Border Guard Service arrested around 63000 minors without the support of the country's southwestern border this year, immigration reform came to the surface again, this time as a women's problem.</seg>

<seg id="40">"They speak for themselves," said Меркадо.</seg>
<seg id="41">When the vast majority of working visas are issued [иммигрантам-мужчинам], women who come to them are in position, vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Economic Development Ministry wants to accelerate the growth of the electric car market</seg>
<seg id="2">This week the Ministry of Economic Development will make the government a comprehensive plan for the development of clean vehicles in Russia, told the deputy director of the ministry, Oleg Плужников at the round table that held a Moscow newspaper Vedomosti on show - 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">The plan drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals - reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is expected that the document will be passed in late September and early October, says Плужников, proposed measures concern the development of electric cars and hybrids - a plan for газомоторном fuel in Russia are already there.</seg>
<seg id="5">The plan (a copy of the Vedomosti) is designed for 2014-2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">To develop assessment criteria for electrical and hybrid vehicles and decide how to promote the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">The government report, which will be described in the tax and customs measures... to support, will be prepared by December 2014; the concessional lending and leasing will be open by April 2015, and proposals to reduce prices, stimulate and create a suitable infrastructure will be developed by October 2015</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014-2015, is expected to make changes to the regulations to ease conditions for the construction of the infrastructure charge (parking, petrol stations etc.).</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, federal officials plan for 2015 to formulate proposals for regional authorities to also promote the use of clean transport - in the form of providing him with benefits in motion and parking, for example; and by February 2016 and the expansion of government purchases of such transport.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, the Ministry of Economic Development by October 2014 will depend on the evaluation of the activities of the regional authorities of criteria that reflect the effectiveness of the support for the production of clean transport, the development of the infrastructure charge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Electric car market in Russia is still only formed in 2013 across the country sold about 100 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the beginning of the 2014 обнулена import duty on electric cars, so sales will be approximately 500 pieces, predicts, the chief executive of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey Pankov.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the Sunderland plant opened and does not make any noticeable: In 2013, according to the Association of European Businesses, sold segment million cars and light commercial vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="14">Until the Sunderland Russia imports only Mitsubishi Motors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Start import is preparing Renault - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says director for strategic planning and partnerships in Russia Renault Nicolas Ремиз.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most of the other manufacturers of electric transport took in relation to Russia is taking a wait-and-see approach.</seg>
<seg id="17">The development of electric cars have and Russian manufacturers GAZ directors "," ",", "but the мизерный.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in January - July 2014, according to the "АСМ-холдинга," Avtovaz has issued 30.</seg>
<seg id="19">Demand is also degrading due to cost, admits director of AvtoVAZ in June Sergei Аманов, without state support the breakthrough in this segment will not.</seg>
<seg id="20">Development of the single market, in addition to the cost of electric cars (those that are sold in Russia, on average, twice as much as the internal combustion engines) is an underdeveloped infrastructure charge (retails sites - units), "sighs of Автостата Sergei Целиков.</seg>
<seg id="21">Because of the cost and the low rate of decline in the cost of electric cars in the next 3-4 years remain нишевым segment of the Russian market, "predicts editor-in-chief Mikhail Подорожанский Авторевю Целиков, agrees with him.</seg>
<seg id="22">Car manufacturers, on the other hand, say that some models of electric car is already close to the value of the ordinary.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Russian market between good prospects, the important thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "real" электромобильность; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of new charging stations, the group president of BMW's Wolfgang Шлимме.</seg>
<seg id="24">Such infrastructure projects, for example, is the "Россети": In Moscow several stations, soon there will be about 80.</seg>
<seg id="25">Talks about building a network of retails sites are and with other regions.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to the director of the department "Россетей" Vladimir Софьина, the company believes the market is ready to build electric and gas stations across the country, but there are problems: A small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging different brands.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, "Россети" as network the company does not have the right to engage in the sale of electricity, the ability to do this in relation to charging.</seg>
<seg id="28">Pankov believes the most effective measure in support of Russia's electric car market progeSOFT customs duties.</seg>
<seg id="29">Zero rate will act before the end of 2014, its renewal and expansion of the preferential list.</seg>
<seg id="30">The transportation tax to environmental (the idea is being discussed and all cars) also support the market, but not as noticeably as customs preferences, said Pankov.</seg>
<seg id="31">Vehicle tax in Russia is relatively small, "says Pankov, unlike, for example, from Norway, where the tax has led to a sharp increase in electric sales - now they account for 12% of the market.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, and the need for stimulus measures, such as free parking in the centre of town (as it has done in Moscow), I am sure Pankov, or any of the electric car movement of dedicated lanes, which in Russia.</seg>

<seg id="6">On the night of August 29, the White House said that President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed the possibility of additional sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The weakening of the ruble is long-term in nature and, in tandem with the euro, and in tandem with the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="8">The long-term forecast assumed that mark, "says senior analyst at Alpari Bodrov's" Anna. "</seg>
<seg id="9">All of that has to do with Ukraine, one way or another will be reflected on the courses.</seg>
<seg id="10">As long as this continues, investors will react.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, rumors about the invading troops are not confirmed nor on the one hand, but the market was very emotional.</seg>

<seg id="13">This week, according to forecasts, will be closed around these levels, and the ruble 36,90 37,05 dollar.</seg>

<seg id="18">Still, will look at whether to impose the penalties, as promised, will meet NATO.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to him, the ruble weakened sharply after the tax season, then went to Ukraine, the Central Bank, last week said that by the end of the year to a fully floating exchange rate and waives any currency interventions.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you look at the daytime wobble, it is no different from the previous ones during this month, all spooked is the mark of 37 rubles, "continued the analyst.</seg>
<seg id="21">And so, in terms of turnover - nothing has happened.</seg>
<seg id="22">Worrying times for the foreign exchange market, I would like to remind you that at the end of January, though increased demand for the currency, as well as a third of March, when the Central Bank отгрузил a record number of currency.</seg>
<seg id="23">In UFS IC and see the positive side of the weakening ruble.</seg>
<seg id="24">First of all, this increase in the revenue part of the budget from the export operations, as well as to enhance the competitiveness of the domestic manufacturers at the expense of more expensive imports, "says chief analyst with UFS IC Alexei Kozlov.</seg>
<seg id="25">Negative moments can be attributed to the cost of imported goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduces the appeal of investment in the Russian economy, rising inflationary pressure, and, as a result, become more expensive for borrowing funds which, in turn, slows down the development of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="27">If we talk about the stock market, the rouble devaluation lack a decline in stock prices, expressed in roubles.</seg>
<seg id="28">For example, the MICEX index during trading Thursday fell 1.67 per cent, while the RTS Index lost 3.27 percent.</seg>
<seg id="29">Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of reduction of indices due to the weakening of the ruble during the day more than 1.5%.</seg>
<seg id="30">The weakening of the ruble is an emotional character and can be explained by a massive desire to buy the currency.</seg>
<seg id="31">In practice, gradually emotions go to, and quotes the ruble partially or completely restore lost ground.</seg>
<seg id="32">"We believe, soon we will be able to see the value of the dollar and the Russian currency is near the level of 36 rubles to the dollar," said Alexei Kozlov.</seg>

<seg id="2">Восстанавливающаяся economy means more customers, the more sales and jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Account for taxes on the state and local level for companies across the country, moderately increased in the last year, which accelerated the recovery, according to a new study, published last week, and the company in the Washington area is no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion in the coffers of the state and local level in fiscal 2013, to 3.8 percent more than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tax burden on business in the state and local level in the past year has increased by 4.3 per cent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after avoiding each other, smaller, when accounts in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">State taxes, rose 4.3 percent, faster than the local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to the study, which was conducted by providing professional services, Ernst & Young and the taxation of the taxation policy group.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of tax revenue in the county, 56 percent, in taxes on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of tax revenue for Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia, with 28 percent, is the lowest in proportion to the amount of tax revenue from businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">To a large extent, is caused by the growth of tax revenues return to the same level of the value of real estate companies, the researchers say, that raised taxes on real estate at 3.7 percent this year, after three years in a row, when growth was less than 1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large proportion of those earnings in larger states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same thing is happening in the Washington area.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion property taxes at the state and local level in the past year, to $9.6 billion more than in 2012 - a growth of 4.2 per cent, compared with the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the return of the value of the property does not have a similar effect on the growth of tax revenue for the state and local level in Maryland, where the property taxes just more than one-fifth of the companies' tax bills.</seg>
<seg id="14">Virginia and the District of Columbia are paying about half the tax bills at the state and local level, in the form of taxes on real estate.</seg>
<seg id="15">"What is happening in Maryland is that such a large part of their real estate tax base, particularly around the District of Columbia, belongs to either the government or nonprofit organization that does not pay taxes on real estate," said Douglas Линдхолм, executive director of the Center on taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, Maryland had to rely more on, for example, income taxes to pay for those services that exist in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent increase in tax receipts from businesses cannot fully explain the recovery of the real estate market.</seg>
<seg id="18">Income entrepreneurs also, it seems, are on the mend, according to this data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Chinese companies may increasingly raise capital in the company's corporate income tax at the state level in the amount of $2.3 billion to $2.1 billion more than in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland has collected $1 billion of corporate income tax, the most in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although the trend in one direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level did not increase with the same speed in all three areas.</seg>
<seg id="22">The level of growth in the District of Columbia was on the same level as the average for the country of 4.3 per cent, while growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only in Virginia was the rise of tax revenues equal to 4.1 percent below average.</seg>
<seg id="24">In Virginia was the lowest corporate income tax from three jurisdictions (each of which the same corporate rate) equal to 6 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Maryland corporate rate of 8.25 percent, whereas in the District is relatively high - 9,975 percent.</seg>
<seg id="26">Like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that lower taxes for entrepreneurs in Virginia, the state and local level and, on the whole, a more favorable climate in terms of taxes for entrepreneurs than in Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="27">The county has not assessed in this study.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite his advantage, Virginia faces competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south.</seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina recently signed a legislative act that corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="30">If the state will continue to reach targets on tax moves into the country in the next year, this law would raise the income tax rate for entrepreneurs, even up to 3 per cent by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="31">Meanwhile, a small business in the Washington area, it seems, feels better and, thus, pay more taxes at the state and local level, according to a recent study.</seg>
<seg id="32">Taxes for entrepreneurs, in the form of individual income tax paid by the owners of small businesses is a transitional structure, the things that most of the small firms, in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, with much greater growth than taxes for предпринимателй in general.</seg>
<seg id="33">The researchers say that the trend and an increase in revenues from taxes on businesses across the country are likely to persist this year, with the proceeds of the tax on turnover in the governments of the state and local level, to 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year.</seg>
<seg id="34">However Вашингтонская area can keep reducing federal spending, as well as impact on the labour market in the region.</seg>

<seg id="3">He has developed a system that can take books from старшекурсников, offering them rated compensation that they delayed their sale.</seg>
<seg id="4">"My textbook on mathematical analysis, which usually costs $180, I received a semester for $10 and biscuits" Chick-fil-A "," says Schroeder, 19, who studies at Ковенант College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The literature on the cost would be $430 last semester, he said.</seg>

<seg id="15">Sometimes, if you come in, the price of a new book may be one third from the one that you'll see in the university bookshop.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" Ron this, Bruce Edwards's and Robert Хостетлера worth about $290 privately, but a copy can be purchased for $239,99 site Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Buying used</seg>
<seg id="18">If you don't mind strangers made or injuries, second-hand textbooks is a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Mathematical analysis" sold for $93,49 подержанном form on to Chegg.com.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Кэсэдей, 25 years later, a fourth year student at the University of Бригэм Young, said that paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for the textbook in strategic decisions in the media: An understanding of the business side of the advertising business. "</seg>
<seg id="21">The book sold for $48.</seg>
<seg id="22">Teachers, for instance, Ingrid Брейси, director of "without walls" College at the University of Massachusetts in Эмхерсте, offers students refine their professors, to previous editions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates are for.</seg>
<seg id="24">In such cases, the issue often can be found in a very small fraction of the cost of the latest edition.</seg>

<seg id="30">Find out the rules, the store where you take books, including any fines that you can write notes in the gallery, and damage.</seg>
<seg id="31">If you take a book, remember: If you don't will regain the book, fines may even exceed the cost of the new instance.</seg>

<seg id="33">Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks is another option.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sometimes such books from the car, electronic license for a certain period for retailers, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rent "Mathematical analysis" on the site Chegg.com for six months will cost about $61.</seg>
<seg id="36">Брейси says that students who study literature, can often find the most advantageous prices, as many classic works now, you can download for free, while the literature on natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.</seg>
<seg id="37">Despite that, осмотритесь.</seg>
<seg id="38">Joe Голт, 29 years old, which is going to start their studies in high school, and recommends Legal Пеппердин use ISBN numbers to find out the prices for the book, because it ensures that you are looking for precisely the right you text.</seg>
<seg id="39">But before you order online, "says Голт, be sure to check whether a book is in stock.</seg>
<seg id="40">To him this lesson Hemsedal is not easy.</seg>

<seg id="39">Санкционное menu</seg>
<seg id="40">On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of specific economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which is basically food sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="41">The country banned the import of pork, beef, a by-product from meat and poultry, meat, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cheese, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausage and sugar syrups.</seg>
<seg id="42">The restaurants began чехарда with suppliers: Prices for food rose, there is an urgent need to seek counterparts from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="43">This will affect the most expensive restaurants with монокухней France, Italy, Spain, in which products supplied directly from the "maternal" countries.</seg>
<seg id="44">Общепиту education had to before.</seg>
<seg id="45">For example, when, at the beginning of 2014, the Rosselkhoznadzor banned import of Australian beef, and the year before - the American and Canadian meat.</seg>
<seg id="46">Instead established suppliers of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="47">But sanctions лета-2014 were much more serious.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which lifted the ban on Atlantic salmon and trout fry безлактозное, milk, seed potatoes, corn, peas and onions сахарную for replanting.</seg>
<seg id="49">The Italian Валерио hopes that sanctions might even смягчиться.</seg>
<seg id="50">As long as there is uncertainty in terms of restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="51">According to the company, "East-West", one of the largest suppliers of imported products in the HoReCa premium segment accounted for up to 70%.</seg>
<seg id="52">"Expensive restaurants to change menu under the produce of local farmers and other countries," says Sergei Mironov, Resurrection, owner of the agency "Рестконсалт."</seg>
<seg id="53">If the strong, for him it's not going to be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="54">But we have very little of these chefs, and the development of new menu items may take two to three months.</seg>
<seg id="55">The Brasserie restaurant Тригель "Bridge" prepared to give up: From 10% to 15%, even half of the menu - recycle.</seg>
<seg id="56">In restaurants with a kitchen are starting to replace dishes, for example steak from the marble beef - on Beef Stroganoff, says Sergei Mironov.</seg>
<seg id="57">"Cheeses from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian, cheese, cheese from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," lists the "East-West" Oksana Глибчук.</seg>
<seg id="58">Cream and milk products from Europe have counterparts in Russia and Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="59">Chicken from the United States may be replaced by one from Russia and Belarus, and salmon from Norway - salmon, семга семгой, those from Belarus and Chile.</seg>
<seg id="60">The absence of vegetables and fruits of European production may be at the expense of domestic manufacturers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.</seg>
<seg id="61">According to Mironov, rebuild their network components will be easier than премиальному segment: There is unlikely to be able to distinguish, went to 16-year-old Italian mozzarella is from the Russian.</seg>
<seg id="62">Although it is difficult to have institutions Ginza Project, he says.</seg>
<seg id="63">The Ginza Project a few dozen restaurants under various brands and with their menu.</seg>
<seg id="64">The replacement will take plenty of time, "said Mironov.</seg>

<seg id="69">"The Georgian kitchen no expensive products," says Хатуна Колбая Saperavi, owner of the Georgian restaurants and cafes "Vai мэ!."</seg>
<seg id="70">All cheeses for us to do in Russia, the basis of many dishes - chicken fillets, exotic herbs we don't use. "</seg>
<seg id="71">In Колбаи institutions have not yet removed from the menu of a single cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="72">Timur colon, owner of the restaurants "Чайхона N1" with Uzbek cuisine, sanctions, too: He would have to change the video not only sausages in New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="73">If Russia our owned imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we even win in price, for us, it will be cheaper than imports from Europe, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="74">From the CIS can be cheaper to get to engineering, sausages, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit.</seg>

<seg id="9">The parameters laid out in the draft guidelines, and are designed to eliminate this obstacle in the way of the implementation of the "европротокола" in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to them, the maximum payout has been in connection with the accident, without the police, must not be lower than the limit on "европротоколу."</seg>
<seg id="11">But at the same time, she can't be above a certain limit, the treaty has insurance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The idea, of course, useful and theoretically capable of relieving both its employees and roads.</seg>
<seg id="13">But, most likely, it will not delight or car drivers, nor insurers.</seg>
<seg id="14">The last now talk about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which could lead to the introduction of new rules on payments has.</seg>
<seg id="15">As for the drivers, it's hard to imagine what kind of work will have to be done to overcome as the Russian conservatism.</seg>
<seg id="16">In most cases, the driver would be hours to wait for the inspectors to make small accident, because more robust.</seg>
<seg id="17">And it's not clear that it will be easier to convince drivers to win more - or the "европротокола."</seg>
<seg id="18">Savings certificate will be registered and irrevocable</seg>
<seg id="19">The Finance Ministry wants to block savings certificates on the bearer, but will allow banks to make them the безотзывного contribution.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Finance Ministry is preparing a bill that would prohibit savings certificates on the bearer.</seg>
<seg id="21">In recent years, this tool is gaining popularity, as rates are higher than on bank deposits.</seg>
<seg id="22">The fact is that savings certificates on the bearer not the bank deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper because they don't have to make payments to the Fund Deposit Insurance Agency (pointed out).</seg>
<seg id="23">Successfully situation in the fact that this step will be taken because of the small and medium-sized banks, spreading such certificates, and suffer from Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which, according to the pointed, control 98 per cent of demand.</seg>
<seg id="24">With the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, about 3.5%.</seg>
<seg id="25">The problem, pointed out, the explanation lies in the fact that a small bank that bought such a certificate, in case of license revocation if he is trying to get money in pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates on the bearer, may assume that their investment is insured.</seg>
<seg id="27">The absence of reasonable insurance payments on these certificated in case of license revocation by the bank can lead to misunderstandings and social tensions.</seg>
<seg id="28">In practice, there have been cases in which the agency issuing the certificate to seek insurance предъявительских redress through the court, "he said in a pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="29">The problem, of course, made-up.</seg>
<seg id="30">The certificates pay buyers still nobody will, as they have on the law if there is no right to compensation from the State.</seg>
<seg id="31">If the case was that the tool is not insured in pointed, together with him and would be prohibited, which means citizens are one of four grams in precious metals, gold, silver, platinum and palladium.</seg>
<seg id="32">Since these accounts do not come with deposit insurance system, but their existence as long as no one deprives.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is likely that the bearer certificates are very comfortable, which actually can act in the role of квазиденег.</seg>
<seg id="34">With almost no control of their movement: The bank can buy a certificate to every citizen, and where you can withdraw up to such a certificate may change a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is not by chance that the draft, which must be a savings certificate, which must be stored in depositories.</seg>
<seg id="36">And Putin ’ s banks are allowed to issue such certificates without the right to early repayment.</seg>
<seg id="37">That is a similar безотзывного contribution, which has long been a dream of the bankers.</seg>

<seg id="1">Met two Union</seg>
<seg id="2">The talks at the highest level in Minsk is not decided, for the sake of which were called back, but gave rise to a new format: The first person in the European Union, met with the chief executives of the Eurasian future</seg>
<seg id="3">If lifestyle changes have fuelled an alarming and the situation around Ukraine (very urgent does not tolerate), the leaders of the EU and Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of "hot issues."</seg>
<seg id="4">It is capable of such a structure to work effectively, it is not clear; but it is clear who took the cream of this summit.</seg>
<seg id="5">Questions on this one evening on August 26, when the Belarusians, and followed them and other евразийцы Europeans saw a television with a new President Lukashenko.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Belarusian leader revealed отточенной example of talent, this was the man who had just caught the jackpot - and is planning a decent old age in society.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Maidan Lukashenko helped</seg>
<seg id="8">The arrival of the three main European commissioners (of the EU), who met with Mr. Lukashenko and allowed him to perform on the final briefing on their behalf -- not just легитимация president the past.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is an application for recognition of a full European policy and the campaign of the Ukrainian crisis.</seg>
<seg id="10">A senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Studies Denis Мельянцов sure: From now on, Brussels will not have to talk to Minsk in the same tone as before.</seg>
<seg id="11">"What Catherine Ashton met face to face with Lukashenko, gives reason to believe that the relationship with the EU will be размораживаться and beyond," he said "Огоньку."</seg>
<seg id="12">This is the tip of the iceberg: The hidden part of training to break through the Belarusian authorities began long before November Maidan in Kiev - 2013-го in the summer.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The results have been achieved and the EU is the successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues about modernization," lists interlocutor of Ogonyok which had - and with the United States have held talks on international security.</seg>
<seg id="14">The United States was even a little bit of sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="15">As regards the Ukrainian events, then they and their reaction to the Belarus only invoked another influx of this process.</seg>
<seg id="16">Minsk, on the one hand, managed to preserve relations with Ukraine are warm, not much to lose in mutual trade, and a President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for talks.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other hand, the leader of the Senate, which has not recognized the annexation of Crimea by Russia and urged to punish pro-Russian militia in the Donbas with the severity, and quarreled with Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="18">Minsk has not released any of the Customs Union, nor from the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), and the web is the Russian air base.</seg>
<seg id="19">Brussels and Washington have a balanced position of Minsk to the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated her, believe the experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">How successful will the movement's political diversification, will be seen by how often the Minsk meeting ever to take the EU + TC.</seg>
<seg id="21">The press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy Catherine Ashton and diplomacy have failed to answer questions about what Brussels wants from the relationship in a new format.</seg>
<seg id="22">A spokesman for Ashton said only "Maya Косьянчич Огоньку" that decisions on issues of war and peace, this issue is not a priority.</seg>
<seg id="23">While there were reports that following a meeting on the Ukraine issue, with the participation of the people in the new format may be, and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="24">A drop of tar in Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that on this, as it turns out, personally asked the representatives of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nevertheless, the final briefing Alexander Lukashenko made it clear: All sides are not opposed to Minsk remained central to the meetings as Россия--ОБСЕ--Украина, and at the level of heads of states and representatives of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="26">This means that "the last dictator in Europe" quite рукопожатного acquires the status of European leader that helps to solve a global problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">Farmer's best friend</seg>
<seg id="28">The EU delegation, which included еврокомиссаров on trade and energy, in conclusion: The main underlying reason for the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbas, and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="29">In fact, the meeting schedule сверстанное future negotiations on the supply of gas and to overcome the fear of CU on the agreement about an association between Ukraine and the EU looks like an achievement and more extensive than peace declaration without specific dates and numbers.</seg>
<seg id="30">Trade Commissioner Karl De Гюхт, nevertheless, on EU representatives: "Arrived in Minsk to find solution to the political crisis which has economic consequences, and not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="31">It seems, however, that the economy and the crisis in Ukraine "works" in Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its consequences - and above all reciprocal sanctions from the West and Russia, offer cut-price, who until he feels санкционное pressure, with room for maneuver.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to the head of the Mises Research Centre, the Belarus Романчука, European investors are actively interested in opportunities for supplies of agricultural products to Russia in bypassing sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="34">The schemes, which are Vladimir Putin at the summit пожурил Minsk.</seg>
<seg id="35">"By these schemes," said Romanchuk Огоньку "," are not the Belarusian businessmen and Russian companies.</seg>
<seg id="36">They worked for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today the scheme destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Russian business is in desperate need to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of the Belarusian authorities.</seg>
<seg id="38">The second story, "the expert continues," is linked to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not averse to the production of the raw material of Belarus with the Russian market.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Ukrainian producers about 4 billion of exports to Russia, and the Belarusian производственно-торговые scheme now could be very popular. "</seg>
<seg id="40">According to Романчука, the role of the host site for the negotiations, the EU and the CU is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of the development of economic ties with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="41">He recalls that the loss of the agricultural sector of the EU sanctions against Moscow are estimated at 10 billion euros, and the Commission is currently proposed 5.45 only 125 million euros in compensation.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Belarusian president could offer to Brussels to work together to minimise the consequences for еврофермеров.</seg>
<seg id="43">This can raise the authority of Lukashenko to the EU to unprecedented height.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hospitality without initiatives</seg>
<seg id="45">Catherine Ashton thanked the authorities for the initiative for the summit.</seg>
<seg id="46">But the paradox is that the Minsk from his active role in the birth of the format, and the CU + открещивается Belarusian leader at a meeting with Ukrainian counterpart emphasized that the new format and it was.</seg>
<seg id="47">"It was your suggestion to come, without any навала discuss, not with бухты-барахты decide, after the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU, to sort out the situation, which at that time was in Ukraine," he said in front of cameras to Peter Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, observers interpreted it as an attempt to calm Moscow, she reportedly was originally against the mediation, which greatly increases his political weight.</seg>
<seg id="49">In the Belarusian diplomatic establishment carefully emphasize that cooperation between the EU and Belarus in the organization to not pursue the land lucrative goals, and the ultimate goal of this format in the future - the creation of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.</seg>
<seg id="50">"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts which, in other fields, in particular in the field of security, and the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation," the Foreign Ministry said "Огоньку", which in recent times has been carefully select words.</seg>

<seg id="3">His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later discloses that Putin had in mind the hint that восточноукраинская territory under the control of the separatists will become part of Russia, but that we need to reconsider its status within Ukraine, to give русскоговорящему region to protect their rights and interests.</seg>

<seg id="10">Only the government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions, "said Peskov.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is not a matter for discussion between Russia and Ukraine, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and an internal Ukrainian conflict."</seg>
<seg id="12">The intervention by the Kremlin's press secretary, to rectify incorrect "interpretation of the words" Putin stressed the decision of the Russian leadership to behave in relation to the breakaway rebellion in the east in any other way than to open the seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the population are ethnic Russians 2-миллионного.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow had to withstand much more heavy battle to attach even Луганскую region of eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and, as the majority of the 6.5 million residents are Russians, and polls before the start of the conflict, showed broad support for the desire to stay within Ukraine.</seg>

<seg id="18">However, his opinion on autonomy, it seems, is very different from the view of the Kremlin and повстанцев-сепаратистов, and which is accused of abetting in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="19">Last call for Putin to Kiev to negotiate with the leaders of the separatists, as with equal, followed by new наступлениями rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks rolled into previously peaceful areas of the eastern Ukraine along the Sea of Azov.</seg>
<seg id="20">Russia and the separatists have taken control of the city in the past, the Новоазовск the Ukrainian security services say they are afraid that he is beginning a campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory to the Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="21">This led to a large-scale civilian and military efforts to strengthen when the port of Mariupol, with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Новоазовском and narrow 27 on the Crimean peninsula.</seg>

<seg id="1">Anger has turned out to be the most versatile and functional human emotion</seg>

<seg id="11">Anger, as well as in animals, is a threat to their own power: Exaggerated manifestation of that force to agree and to obey.</seg>
<seg id="12">Man inflated поджимает nostrils and lips with the same purpose, and a frog that надувается or бабуин, which demonstrates their fangs.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Anger" runs "refusal to accept the situation, and the face immediately takes the form of effectively has demonstrated the opposite side of the consequences of this failure.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the most striking is that none of the components гневного faces is not arbitrary, they are one and the same, "said anthropologist John Туби.</seg>
