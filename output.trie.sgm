<seg id="1">Recalling a very American ideal that labor rights are human rights</seg>
<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have offered the bill, which is protected by the unions as a civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">"where unions, jobs and the middle class," says Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, who is co-chair of the Congress of Progressive factions.</seg>
<seg id="4">That's why I proudly represent the expansion of rights of workers with the symbol of the civil rights movement by John Lewis.</seg>
<seg id="5">This bill will give workers the same legal opportunities when discrimination organization of trade unions, and other forms of discrimination, stopping force opponents of trade unions</seg>
<seg id="6">Modification of the law on the regulation of labour relations in such a way as to allow workers encountering discrimination for participating in organizations, trade unions, to seek justice in civil courts - and receive compensation and punitive payments - a sensible and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it's certainly not radical initiative - at least by American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the best way to understand that offer Ellison, Lewis and co-authors of the bill - to remember a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the attacks, which trade unions were in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - the Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, to expand and to respect labour rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time, remember, millions of Americans, when this country simultaneously defend democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur was ready and his assistants have helped the country to accept the constitution, so to ensure that autocracy which Хидеки Тодзё was replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included text that explicitly recognized that "the right of workers to organize, and on negotiations and collective action is guaranteed."</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Эйзенхауер and his assistants helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that fascism Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recognizing that workers will need to be organized and be heard in the new state, Germans have included an article that openly stated: "the right to form associations to protect and improve labour and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict or seek to diminish that right, will have no legal force; measures for these purposes, be declared illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">When former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which was World Declaration on Human Rights, which in 1948 will be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to organize and join unions to protect their interests."</seg>
<seg id="17">Generations of Americans took for granted basic position that labor rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country advised on the other countries about how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans have explained that the right to organize labor unions - and to this union participated as equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies, must be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now, when these rights are under assault in America, wisely, indeed, return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize, and to ensure that their voices were heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:</seg>
<seg id="21">History is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now everyone knows that trade union movement is not undermined power nation, but increased them.</seg>
<seg id="23">Raising living standards of millions, unions miraculously created a market for industry and raised a whole nation on fragile level of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack the unions, forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.</seg>
<seg id="25">History remembers should and to us.</seg>
<seg id="26">Official recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the protection of civil rights, to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions - was long overdue.</seg>
<seg id="27">Keith Ellison and John Lewis Ukraine ideals that historically expanded America did promise democracy reality.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the U.S., a federal judge on Sunday temporarily has blocked the introduction of the law of Louisiana, which his supporters say he likely will close all five абортных clinics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to this measure, which was signed by the Governor of Louisiana Bobby Джинадлом in June and was supposed to go into effect on 1 September, doctors who do abortions, were obliged to have powers of patients in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the judge's decision means that at the moment, doctors can continue to do legal abortions, continuing to look for such authority.</seg>
<seg id="5">"complainants will be allowed to work legally, continuing actions to gain power," wrote in his decision the judge John деГрэвеллз.</seg>
<seg id="6">The hearing will be scheduled within a month, at which the judge made a more permanent solution on this law.</seg>
<seg id="7">The defenders of the right to abortion with joy met this decision, the last in decisions against similar measures, saying it will give doctors more time to receive hospital authority.</seg>
<seg id="8">"today's decision ensures that women Louisiana will be protected Industies law which seeks to deprive their health and rights," said Nancy Нортап, president and head of the Center for reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the five clinics.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the decision to the doctors of the two clinics, which are not played claimants in the case, and also filed a declaration on authority.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of the 11 states that have adopted similar laws, and the courts recently acknowledged such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="11">Key part of техасского law that would have closed most of the remaining clinics in this state, were blocked by federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fighters for the right to abortion, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association say the law on the powers of impose on doctors restrictions, which are not necessary from the point of view of medicine.</seg>
<seg id="13">Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, though some also noted their positive effect in closing clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only one doctor, which makes abortions in Louisiana, is in the hospital, said the Center for reproductive Rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all the other doctors in the state will be forced to cease to perform this procedure, this doctor, fearing for their safety, would cease to perform this procedure reported group.</seg>

<seg id="1">What will the introduction of quotas for domestic products</seg>
<seg id="2">Not less than half of products for each type of goods in range trading networks should be the Russian production, says Duma deputy from the Just Russia Oleg Nilov.</seg>
<seg id="3">The MP has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures for domestic manufacturers, writes the newspaper Izvestia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The document will still some points to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.</seg>
<seg id="5">It concerns goods that are not produced in Russia. <... > According to the rest of the groups of products, which are produced in Russia Vester will provide at least half of their shelves domestic producers, "Nilov.</seg>
<seg id="6">Together with the amendments to Article of the Russian Federation "in the bill provides for the introduction of changes in Tax Code laying down lines rate VAT 10% for products produced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea to introduce a 50% quota -процентную in trade networks included in the stimulus bill for Russian producers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The shop will have several times more domestic goods.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the initiative can have both a positive and negative effect, say the experts.</seg>
<seg id="10">Attorney Налоговик ", a member of an independent centre of expertise" Public Duma Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive, and will lead to growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">The key will be, farmers, small shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">They will be able to sell more, and this means that profits will grow.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, they will have the right to dictate retailers their conditions and prices, because those will be forced to buy their goods.</seg>
<seg id="14">Russian manufacturers will be able to increase the volume of its activities and sales that will pay higher taxes than before.</seg>
<seg id="15">It will increase revenue, create new jobs, any industry will begin to expand any faster осваиваться would be contribution to GDP growth.</seg>
<seg id="16">Russia's dependence on foreign food fall several times, however, not immediately, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="17">Earlier Russian enterprises often could not go on the shelves of local shops due to high competition from foreign analogues.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche liberated and sigh of relief.</seg>
<seg id="19">But do not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary inspections to the Russian market will be available food from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="20">In other words, it is now "time periods" when former players have already left, and new is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nearly a month can be of demand for Russian raw materials, as well as rising prices on finished products, "said АиФ.ru first Vice President all-Russian" Russian club financial directors, Tamara Kasyanov.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clearly, the idea to sell in each category at least 50% of food products will be sector for local producers.</seg>
<seg id="23">In that case, they will compete with each other, not with goods that through subsidies of another State, are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="24">In other words, the struggle for the buyer will unfold between companies, working on a single law industry.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, notes Kasyanov, Russian producers can meet 50% of domestic needs compatriots not in all aspects.</seg>
<seg id="26">And in this situation commercial networks will have to "дотягивать" share of Russian goods up to half of the range.</seg>
<seg id="27">In connection with this increase concerns that the president will be available substandard goods.</seg>
<seg id="28">Perhaps under the guise of produced in Russia will be delivered to foreign products with перебитыми labels, "adds an expert.</seg>
<seg id="29">A negative effect of introducing quotas feel large trading networks, especially those which выгодней cooperate with importers.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is logical that the will suffer and foreign suppliers, as demand for their products will decrease.</seg>
<seg id="31">Litvinenko does not exclude that the law on quotas on domestic goods can respond and the consumers.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fact is that some products of the Russian production can yield quality imported ones, while shops will boosting prices on the second as a scarce commodity.</seg>
<seg id="33">About the early 2000s idea of import substitution economists started talking again in February this year because of ongoing devaluation of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="34">Now against the background of difficult relations with the West, the question of the import of products becomes even more relevant.</seg>
<seg id="35">The law is designed to oblige retailers in the formation of the orders to suppliers to domestic producers.</seg>
<seg id="36">Then we much faster and more confident come to import substitution and the planning system of production on necessary types of products will be created in a short time, "says MP Oleg Nilov.</seg>
<seg id="37">Especially effective mechanism be quotas for those agricultural sectors where potential is especially high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.</seg>
<seg id="38">Our farmers really able to fully cover the counters of Russian shops.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition, a powerful impulse can get and uranium production.</seg>
<seg id="40">As is known, the biggest share of imports remains on offer - from 30% to 35%.</seg>
<seg id="41">It turns out, momentum% still on Russian products, "says Kasyanov.</seg>
<seg id="42">Experts are of the opinion that the introduction of quotas for domestic products contribute импортозамещению and can speed up this process.</seg>
<seg id="43">But itself to импортозамещению this initiative will not, as this requires a range of measures, I am sure Litvinenko.</seg>
<seg id="44">In any case 50% sold goods according to this initiative still can be brought from abroad, which means full import substitution will happen, but significant steps in this direction will be done.</seg>
<seg id="45">The same little set quotas, must still improve in the country production of domestic products to these quotas.</seg>
<seg id="46">These quotas as such guarantees and provide, "the expert.</seg>

<seg id="1">Inflation out of the vacation.</seg>
<seg id="2">Whether Russians feel a sharp rise in prices</seg>
<seg id="3">As a result of the November sanctions Russia and the West inflation in Russia but not in forecasts уложится authorities, convinced analysts "VTB Capital."</seg>
<seg id="4">According to experts, the deferred effects антисанкций will lead to inflationary early in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the latest forecast, in 2014 inflation will be 6,5-7,5% next year and the less - 6.5%.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to newspaper Kommersant, "this week, ministry should make" small but fundamental "changes in macroeconomic forecast up to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the publication, the department can lower assessment of inflation in 2015, which will eliminate the expected progeSOFT revenue growth of the population.</seg>
<seg id="8">In forecast suggested that food sanctions Russia act a year - until August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">In such a situation could be to assume such high inflation?</seg>
<seg id="10">The current situation suggests geared shock, but понижательный trend inflation will not change, "said the source of the newspapers in been.</seg>
<seg id="11">Economists from the VTB Capital "do not share expectations economic bloc governments regarding inflation and predict price growth in 2014 at the level of 8%.</seg>
<seg id="12">The main effect of food bans will come together with the possible introduction in the regions of the Russian Federation sales taxes (GAP) in 2015, are convinced experts.</seg>
<seg id="13">Inflationary peak at 9% in February, after which the annual pace of price growth will decline, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="14">By the way, last week Rosstat let the first inflation results after Russia introduced "neat sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="15">АиФ.ru interviewed experts and found their inflationary expectations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Artem Деев, head of research at FC AForex:</seg>
<seg id="17">Prices have already observed in key segments.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moreover, when began to appreciate socially significant products, the government was forced to launch measures system monitoring price stability in order to prevent risks unjustified price increases in the short term.</seg>
<seg id="19">Suppliers and retailers already report on a daily basis before regulators that authorities knew exactly who, when and for what reason will trigger higher prices.</seg>
<seg id="20">Key factors in the consumer price index remain enormous rates of capital flight, excessive refinancing the banking sector from the Russian мегарегулятора, internal convert due to escape in foreign currency, as well as an embargo on the import of food products from the countries that joined the sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="21">If inflationary pressures remained under control, the cost of a minimum basket of products not jumped to 12% for the one only a quarter.</seg>
<seg id="22">The ban on the import of food products provoked shock proposals on the domestic market and led to a completely логичному increase the final cost.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because at the current stage we cannot fully run the mechanism of import substitution, and increase self-sufficiency of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production, sanctions will continue to be growth risks inationary component.</seg>
<seg id="24">If you add one and fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as ухудшенными prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year inflation may well exceed 8%.</seg>
<seg id="25">Alexander Разуваев, director of the analytical department "Alpari"</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month to zero it was also above the current level, another thing that then it offset rapid economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="27">I think, at the end of the year inflation will be 8-8,5%.</seg>
<seg id="28">Plato Магута, managing assets of the Fund Магута "</seg>
<seg id="29">An external factor associated with sanctions against Russia, while successfully contained, but if there is further strengthening pressure primarily on financial sector - this can lead to a certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations, which usually traditionally manifest themselves in purchases of currency to protect their savings.</seg>
<seg id="30">It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance will try to smooth the weakening of the ruble, as methods and government regulation.</seg>
<seg id="31">But prices traditionally begins after a lull over the summer and, possibly, this fall will become more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="32">The target level of consumer inflation in Russia in 7.5%, most likely, a weapon, as Russia has another financial savings.</seg>

<seg id="27">And this example: "a participant when filling out application must specify" specific performance "without words:" or equivalent "," should "," from "," more, "" less, "" similar "" or "," type "," a similar type, "" lower, "" lower, "" higher, "" may, "" can have, "" may, "" earlier "," not earlier, "" higher, "" is not allowed.</seg>
<seg id="28">Thus, customers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of applications of contractors.</seg>
<seg id="29">Another problem 44-ФЗ, according to Евсташенкова, was the need to assess the application quality through "paper" proposal.</seg>
<seg id="30">Considering the application, really can be assessed only qualified contractor, but not the quality of the works, to which even began cooking.</seg>
<seg id="31">The quality of the works can be assessed only on their acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="32">At the expert council also was asked to take a margin income from the upper to the lower echelon to disappeared intermediate contractors.</seg>
<seg id="33">The chairman of the expert committee, espionage, FAS Andrei Цариковский believes that it should not, as responsible for the order should генподрядчик.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, as in the famous репризе of Arkady Raikin normalises sleeping: "пуговицам claims have?"</seg>

<seg id="2">In the former home of gold and горнозаводчиков Евдокима and his son Ivan Демидова on the October Revolution 57 / 1 (former Big Kazan) 18 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="3">The eighteenth century since the construction hardly changed, except ветхость.</seg>
<seg id="4">Outsiders people go here, as the excursion, and tenants more suffer than rejoice, from its privileges - the right to live in старейшем Ufa house whose walls remember commander Alexander Suvorov.</seg>
<seg id="5">Date buildings house amongst others, historians point to the two dates - 1730 and 1737 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in any case, it turns out that the nearly 300 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The old yard, always open the door, the squeaky staircase.</seg>
<seg id="8">Doors in the apartments are located near each other, walls chair covers were cracked, and in просветы peeling plaster places visible from the street.</seg>
<seg id="9">All the honest word.</seg>
<seg id="10">But local residents are told: "you don't think it is."</seg>
<seg id="11">Live in a wooden house the 18th century is very difficult, "says Tatiana 1961, a resident of apartment # 3.</seg>
<seg id="12">The object is on госохране, but money for its content does not stand out tens of years, and we feel museum artifacts, which the authorities simply have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">The last repair was 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The wall even though with great difficulties stay, but the foundation of the entire прогнил.</seg>
<seg id="15">Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, and моются once a week in public bath.</seg>
<seg id="16">How can we be content in such conditions?</seg>
<seg id="17">The road passes directly under the windows, even pedestrian zone.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tatiana will put off curtain.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now you can see what before was only heard it: under the windows of the cars.</seg>
<seg id="20">You see, glass дребезжат constantly, windows open can't, and by noise used to.</seg>
<seg id="21">A person gets used to, to the good and bad.</seg>
<seg id="22">Our apartment still top, thanks to her husband, hands him gold.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, two rooms, three of them live with her son.</seg>
<seg id="24">And the other families conditions much worse, on the second floor ceiling at a little more than one and a half meters tall.</seg>
<seg id="25">For contrast Tatiana offers go to guests to the roommate out of the apartment No. 6 Lyudmila Старостиной.</seg>
<seg id="26">Us woman with threshold offers up a cup of coffee and with a taut smile says:</seg>
<seg id="27">We have a one-bedroom apartment, 14.5 m ² on four people and live: we with her husband and daughter with her granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="28">I am here with the birth, another housing was not never, "Lyudmila обводит eyes room: 3028-IV, two sofa the letter" g "; one of them was granddaughter with a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="29">Very closely and differs little from a domestic interior: only ceilings beautiful, "historical."</seg>
<seg id="30">But with ceiling regularly flows: tap system below.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lyudmila said about his apartment routinely and surprisingly simultaneously, as Italian, the house which stands on Roman ruins.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is, brings in one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:</seg>
<seg id="33">Water spent about 40 years ago during the last repair.</seg>
<seg id="34">Then made us a small kitchen in закутке and toilet from the former self-struggles.</seg>
<seg id="35">We live just where квартировал Demidov family, lived on the second floor of the servants.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our apartment not privatized, and why?</seg>
<seg id="37">Real estate in Ufa say privatization.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still get only apartment, can't apply for more.</seg>
<seg id="39">Already four months ago promised us расселить, but further promises.</seg>
<seg id="40">Not used to complain and I will not.</seg>
<seg id="41">In this apartment (room!) lived a whole the: my grandparents, mother with Dad, I with my husband and my daughter with her granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="42">Things happened during that time.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, doorbell rats scurried about the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="44">Look at the walls флигеля, they one-meter wide thickness.</seg>
<seg id="45">They say the solution was involved in eggs, so long rests.</seg>
<seg id="46">House built thoroughly, thanks Демидовым!</seg>
<seg id="47">Perhaps only so as long as no one killed a crumbling battlement ceiling or сваей.</seg>
<seg id="48">Only construction still slowly dying on the eyes: boards and log homes are rotting, floors have repeatedly failed, we pouring cement, but all useless - solution goes into the ground, as well.</seg>
<seg id="49">They say and have, under our room the concealed лаз and move to the river White, who had once lived here old Believers to hide from danger, in which case.</seg>
<seg id="50">Their.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lyudmila Allard tells how it came some historian, pleaded wield that he started in the flat excavations.</seg>
<seg id="52">And then urged to give them housing space in exchange for its однушку on October.</seg>
<seg id="53">Lyudmila historian refused:</seg>
<seg id="54">Where are we over in однушку?</seg>
<seg id="55">And here at least a tiny hope is that will give housing more spacious.</seg>
<seg id="56">We agree on the exchange, would not have won.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, the family Старостиных nothing and not won.</seg>
<seg id="58">The biggest dream Ludmila to расселили, and daughter with one 16-year-old granddaughter gave a separate room.</seg>
<seg id="59">The two families have identified two-room apartment instead of the majestic ruins, in which two generations live now.</seg>
<seg id="60">The girl was pretty, and Olesya Карсакова from No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor at home.</seg>
<seg id="61">There squeezed in two out of 23 m ², apartments, lives her big family.</seg>
<seg id="62">All us seven people, children two.</seg>
<seg id="63">See for yourself what conditions.</seg>
<seg id="64">Plaster your butt falls off pieces of, and window frames, the walls in the kitchen and the cross-cutting hole.</seg>
<seg id="65">Water in кране all year only cold.</seg>
<seg id="66">Walking about the apartments of the old home, you can ensure that all lucky spouses Lavrentyev from apartment No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="67">They occupy the most spacious rooms of the first floor.</seg>
<seg id="68">You're right, places.</seg>
<seg id="69">In the 75 squares, directed three people.</seg>
<seg id="70">We live in those rooms, where legend has it stopped Suvorov during his stay in Ufa, "says the head of the family of Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentyev.</seg>
<seg id="71">High ceilings, spacious.</seg>
<seg id="72">One bad - all around the train wreck falling apart at the seams, collapsing.</seg>
<seg id="73">Neighbors probably already told.</seg>
<seg id="74">Most suffering with floors: wooden boards сгнили, the earth literally went from under the feet.</seg>
<seg id="75">I put подпорки, wedges; in the hall still nothing, and in another room walk as on a seesaw качаемся, so all was not cemented.</seg>
<seg id="76">About house merchant Евдокима Демидова Aleksandr Dmitrievich can tell better than any guide.</seg>
<seg id="77">To золотопромышленнику applies to the native, speaks of it with admiration.</seg>
<seg id="78">Indeed, the personality was fantastic: host Кагинского and Узянского plants built houses, отливал guns and bells, kept Ural mines.</seg>
<seg id="79">Merchants are proud heirs property an ancestor, but live under one roof with history no longer want.</seg>
<seg id="80">I settled here even as a child, in the 1940s, the 20th century, "says Alexander Dmitrievich.</seg>
<seg id="81">Then around stood wooden premises for карет, barn and sentry boxes, subsequently снесенные.</seg>
<seg id="82">In 1968, wanted to remove and our house, but something prevented.</seg>
<seg id="83">In the 2014: again поманили new housing.</seg>
<seg id="84">We, as on command, collected all documents обегали the instance, and suddenly learned that moving to an apartment in 2015 or 2016.</seg>
<seg id="85">Something already doesn't believe in all this.</seg>
<seg id="86">Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan, to learn the fate of homes.</seg>
<seg id="87">Officials the occupier.</seg>
<seg id="88">Sent from one table to another, and then, as in mockery, given paper without signatures and stamps: "the Ministry of Culture does not against resettlement residents."</seg>
<seg id="89">I have even a feeling that our house has long been not in terms of the city, because he was at number 57, then became 57 A, now 57 / 1.</seg>
<seg id="90">As if his already demolished in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="91">"a planet" turned to the head of sector User management for Ufa Vladimir Барабашу.</seg>
<seg id="92">The house down the street the October Revolution 57 / 1 included resettlement Old housing.</seg>
<seg id="93">I can't be responsible for the actions of officials 1970s, only know that at the time there was a plan to demolition of all old houses, despite the historical significance.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fortunately, this has not happened, and the current authorities - to restore all the ancient home of the October Revolution, representing architectural value, "successfully.</seg>
<seg id="95">Residents soon planned расселить on new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="96">According to Барабаша, restore House Демидова will be Italian experts who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="97">Now in Italy passes architectural Biennale, and the project "Old Ufa" presented there in the other.</seg>
<seg id="98">I hope that by 2016 all former Old Kazan street will be best Western Hotel Tigra was renovated, "said the official.</seg>
<seg id="99">Home will order, that was before, three centuries ago.</seg>
<seg id="100">The house Демидова, is likely to become a museum, open to all comers.</seg>
<seg id="101">In addition, at governmental level decided to make street at the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="102">On weekdays, unfortunately, does not work, too much workload roads in the city.</seg>
<seg id="103">Расселить people from the future museum Vladimir Барабаш promises in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="104">However, it is unlikely that they will be: their new apartments will be the same area that current.</seg>
<seg id="105">Only from another era.</seg>

<seg id="6">The soundtrack - a mixture of 199.4 and rap, and melodies - жизнерадостны.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Henry had to get through some difficult memories of childhood.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the death of his mother was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often reflects on the relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was very inaccessible.</seg>
<seg id="10">You never saw his face, you only heard his voice: "don't make noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Отстань from sisters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Шевелись!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers Seymour and Hilton that were adults, when I was a child, walked with him down the pub and talked about such things as a form of you, the beauty of the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">I have never talked with him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was so неулыбчивым guy in the corner, who read the newspaper most of my life.</seg>
<seg id="17">Henry recently opened литейную studio in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in the days of his father, he could look at what must have been his life.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now there's a little bit better, but it is dark, дымные, depth have Sheol with outbreaks of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father залезал in a bathtub and just lay there, and you have heard, as he slowly begins to sing about themselves, because he wanted to отмыться from little workshop.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I came in there, I realized that he did years and years to earn us as ever, and I began to appreciate it more.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, Henry left the childhood devoid of parental love.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never cuddled, never said, "I love you."</seg>
<seg id="23">Only when her mother became ill at the end of her life, we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you.</seg>
<seg id="24">The birth of her own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love with which he lacked in childhood.</seg>
<seg id="25">You can stop this "I love you"?</seg>
<seg id="26">Just don't hug me!</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I'm 22!</seg>
<seg id="28">With Don French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why me with her not to make friends?</seg>
<seg id="30">She's a great mother</seg>
<seg id="31">They are still great friends with French, in which he was married 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="32">Don is a good man.</seg>
<seg id="33">Why should I not to be friends with Don?</seg>
<seg id="34">She's a great mother.</seg>
<seg id="35">The mother of Henry was diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="36">He was one of what killed her.</seg>
<seg id="37">So, when I very, very recovered and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "you have to take radical measures.</seg>
<seg id="38">Then I began serious training фитенсом, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="40">And it's boring.</seg>
<seg id="41">No one eats carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">A change of career trajectory Henry reflected, perhaps, in his noble, briefly подстриженной beard.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he received the recognition of critics for his Othello, he completely immersed in theatre.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Комедия followed errors," and then "guest" Огаста Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">This work is different from sitcoms and comedies that were неотъемлимым attribute his busy professional life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He began his career, when he was 16 and worked at the factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">DJ noticed, as he parodies on the stage, and wrote about it in "New."</seg>
<seg id="48">His career in television began in the mid seventies: "quite a long time I was the only black пародистом / first on television."</seg>
<seg id="49">He studied at work.</seg>
<seg id="50">I not only had to grow in the eyes of the public, I had to learn how to be an effective machine on delivery jokes between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working on television, and it was very hard.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny in "New faces" in 1975</seg>
<seg id="52">As his manager had the right to "Black and white show minstrels," light entertainment program, in which people "чернили themselves face", Henry found that is in it for five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">My family is a very disliked.</seg>
<seg id="54">I, like, hopefully, this has never been with me, but I don't regret that did it.</seg>
<seg id="55">Although it was a strange, worthy of condemnation position, I worked for and work with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="56">But what was "has awards light entertainment classics on British television years and years," and "grotesque the black people."</seg>
<seg id="57">Introducing characters who were abusive to culture blacks in the UK, and her perfume, Henry worked in alternative комедийном project in the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="58">The first season "Shaw Lenny Henry" was broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as, among other things, the chef Гэрет Блэклок from the comedy series "Biased!".</seg>
<seg id="59">Commercials, documentaries, TV series and roles in movies took the next ten years of his life, but after his series on the BBC in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "what are you going to do next, Len, because some think you тянешь time or slowly сворачиваешь aside."</seg>
<seg id="60">Next was a series of documentary broadcasts on Radio 4 called "What good in...?"</seg>
<seg id="61">The first was about Шекспире.</seg>
<seg id="62">I was allergic to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">We cannot say to me adequately taught this at school, and I thought that this is, in many ways, the prerogative of white people middle class with колготками and cabbage at the bottom of the front.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I liked him very afraid.</seg>
<seg id="65">All who we took an interview for transmission, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Денч said: "you have to try.</seg>
<seg id="66">Not ругай it as long as you don't know what you are talking about.</seg>
<seg id="67">Произнеси aloud some of these words, and you will realize why we all love Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry read 20 rows monologue from Othello for documentary, and his зацепило.</seg>
<seg id="69">I have the feeling that I can do it.</seg>
<seg id="70">It's like my head выправили.</seg>
<seg id="71">"that's what it is, this is a serious case, Treat seriously, situated his text, conduct a study.</seg>
<seg id="72">So, the process of rehearsals was tough, and I read this play months and months before we have set.</seg>
<seg id="73">And she had success.</seg>
<seg id="74">It seemed, they were waiting for disaster, and it is not happened.</seg>
<seg id="75">Soon we started "Комедию errors."</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I am in the National Theatre, and I just could not believe it until the end.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you have changed."</seg>
<seg id="78">A technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his case - entertain the public.</seg>
<seg id="79">"the Pacific voice inside me said:" you have to work 10 minutes until they operations computer "."</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead, assistant director announced that view will resume as soon as the problem will be solved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I walked away from the scene and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."</seg>
<seg id="82">It's not my responsibility.</seg>

<seg id="3">Only sometimes a woman told him that he is too serious, hard, tough, and maybe a little раздражительный.</seg>
<seg id="4">And then she пожимала his hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">He saw in his irritability.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was колючим as hair, yes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The last victim of this колючести was little novel, from which he was more than usually, lonely and boring life, and perhaps even some satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Эйлинн Соломонз was pulsating fragile beautiful with взлохмаченными hair and трепещущим heart from the northern island village, even more remote and harsh than Port Ройбен.</seg>
<seg id="9">She came to the south with master, which Кеверн believed her aunt, with the latter in the house in crude, but like the paradise Valley under the joyful "Райская Valley."</seg>
<seg id="10">No one lived in the house for several years.</seg>
<seg id="11">Pipes were trickling in baths were sitting motionless spiders, слизни left their footprints on all windows, confident that the house belongs to them; garden зарос weeds similar to giant кочаны cabbage.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was like a cottage from the book for children, while frightening and a wonderful, full of secrets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Opinion of the author: Howard Джейкобсон, whose novel "J" is included in лонг-лист Букеровской Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">The shortlist will be announced next week</seg>
<seg id="15">Кеверн and Эйлинн sat, holding hands, broken sun loungers among the high grass, enjoying the unexpectedly warm spring day; they both absentmindedly connect to cheap console, which provided the country appeasing music and 3-zmianowy news, when, looking at the crossed brown legs, he remembered the old song long forgotten black performer that loved to listen to his father, and curtains in the house.</seg>
<seg id="16">You too big legs.</seg>
<seg id="17">In view of the inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type on the console does not lose.</seg>
<seg id="18">They were not banned - nothing actually not been forbidden - just their no longer lose.</seg>
<seg id="19">They become архаичными, as the word "archaic."</seg>
<seg id="20">Public taste did what would never have managed to achieve orders and regulations, and the same as among the books people chose memoirs rich, staying in poverty, cooking books and love the novels, of all the music they chose ballads.</seg>
<seg id="21">For this day, Кеверн began to play the ideation piano and a rough comic voice praise great legs Эйлинн.</seg>
<seg id="22">Эйлинн not realized.</seg>
<seg id="23">"this was a popular if jazz pianist named Фэтс Уоллер," he said, mechanically placing two fingers to his lips.</seg>
<seg id="24">So always did his father to stop letter "J" before she слетит with his lips.</seg>
<seg id="25">It started with games in which they played when he was small.</seg>
<seg id="26">His father played in it with his father, as he told him.</seg>
<seg id="27">Start the word with "J", forgetting to two fingers to his mouth, and it will cost you a penny.</seg>
<seg id="28">It was not a very funny game then and it was a lot of fun now.</seg>
<seg id="29">He knew that from him this waiting, that's all.</seg>
<seg id="30">He had to explain what is jazz.</seg>
<seg id="31">Эйлинн never heard.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jazz is played, even though he was not explicitly prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="33">Improvisation went out of style.</seg>
<seg id="34">In life the only one "if."</seg>
<seg id="35">When the music started, people wanted to know exactly where it will end.</seg>
<seg id="36">With wit exactly the same way.</seg>
<seg id="37">His unpredictability acted people on nerves.</seg>
<seg id="38">But jazz was wit, marked with music.</seg>
<seg id="39">Although he reached the age of 10 years, never слышав about Sammy Дэвисе Младшем, Кеверн knew about jazz from the paternal полусекретной коллеции CDs.</seg>
<seg id="40">But at least he did not have to speak Эйлинн that Фэтс Уоллер was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">Given her age, it is unlikely that she remembered a time when popular singers were not black.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again, no laws or pressure.</seg>
<seg id="43">Education meant that each segment agreed with gratitude - gratitude those spared the fate of, "with the principle of group predispositions.</seg>

<seg id="48">Each according to his abilities.</seg>
<seg id="49">As she had heard only ballads Эйлинн was difficult to understand how offensive words that just sung her Кеверн, could be set to music.</seg>
<seg id="50">Music is an expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">"they are not really offensive," said Кеверн.</seg>
<seg id="52">Except, maybe, for people who have great legs.</seg>
<seg id="53">My father have never offended, but he loved that song.</seg>
<seg id="54">He said too much, but launched garden gave him the illusion of security.</seg>

<seg id="63">Nothing, that he would like to watch.</seg>
<seg id="64">"well, if you say," she said, in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="65">But this still does not explain why you me her sing.</seg>
<seg id="66">She seemed really upset.</seg>
<seg id="67">I have too big feet?</seg>

<seg id="69">You cannot say no.</seg>

<seg id="77">I have such a distortion.</seg>
<seg id="78">It was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="79">He wanted it to be funny.</seg>
<seg id="80">Attempts to joke often made him awkward situation, because, like his father, he lacked the soothing charm that could mitigate the cruelty, крывшуюся in? jokes.</seg>
<seg id="81">Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.</seg>

<seg id="83">Despite the good eyes.</seg>

<seg id="85">So that's the intoxication could not serve as his excuse.</seg>
<seg id="86">In his emotion, she seemed lighter as пальмовые leaves in weather system.</seg>
<seg id="87">"I like you very much because you stupid head," she said.</seg>
<seg id="88">Although not like you very much.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was sorry it and because of the excessive brutality of his words, and because of fear which appeared in her eyes when she gave him.</seg>
<seg id="90">She thought that he was her will?</seg>
<seg id="91">She has not talked to him about life on the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that, in its basic features the здешнюю.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same huge icy ocean befell them both.</seg>
<seg id="93">The same the men, even more sensitive and capricious after that happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened than their ancestors, Smugglers and разрушители, shopped in rage from pub to pub, ready to raise a hand on any woman, посмевшую refuse them or upset them.</seg>
<seg id="94">Stupid head?</seg>
<seg id="95">They would have shown her a fist, if she was not cautious.</seg>
<seg id="96">First would've kissed, kiss now became the most common erotic expression of irritation between a man and a woman; an antidote from fresh ballads, too, which provide proper console - first kiss her, and then hit.</seg>
<seg id="97">Excessive clarification, according to Кеверна because the kiss itself was already DVD films.</seg>
<seg id="98">The Эйлинн Соломонз showed that he needs to leave.</seg>
<seg id="99">He rose from push as the old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She herself felt lead weight, but the weight of his grief surprised her.</seg>
<seg id="101">This was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They barely knew each other.</seg>

<seg id="116">I must also ask you: you атеистка?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I think that is not obliged to answer," replied Эсме Нуссбаум.</seg>
<seg id="118">You lesbian?</seg>
<seg id="119">Эсме again insisted on his right to privacy and silence.</seg>
<seg id="120">Feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Again silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I ask," Luther Рабиновиц finally said, "not because I am against atheism, лесбийства or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">There is no prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="124">We are the servants of society without prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="125">But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely reasonable and a good in themselves, may sometimes distort the results, such as those that you showed me.</seg>
<seg id="126">It is obvious that you предубеждены against the church, and what you call "malevolent" and "rude", others would be interpreted as an expression of natural healthy and intensity.</seg>
<seg id="127">Continue to нудеть about IN THAT happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened, as if it happened, if it happened, yesterday, it means depriving the country needed her life force.</seg>
<seg id="128">Эсме Нуссбаум огляделась around until Рабиновиц said.</seg>
<seg id="129">For his head pink, as equipment, led the letters repeated advice that "Офнау" gave the country the last quarter of a century or more.</seg>
<seg id="130">Улыбайся his neighbour, the energy of his spouse, listen ballads, walk, talk on the phone to organise, communicate, fairytale city, listen, соглашайся, извиняйся.</seg>
<seg id="131">Conversation is better than silence, the word song better than the written word, but there is nothing better love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I fully understand that you want to say," quietly replied Эсме Нуссбаум when satisfied that her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I don't want to say anything, except that we don't he so effectively as we convince ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">I am worried about that unless we are ready, we will find repeat mistakes that initially led to ТОМУ THAT happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened.</seg>
<seg id="134">Only this time we выбросим their anger and mistrust not on the other.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Рабиновиц joined finger-tips in sitting.</seg>
<seg id="136">This gesture was supposed to mean an infinite patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"you go too far," he said, "calling" mistakes "actions that made or not made our grandfathers.</seg>
<seg id="138">You go too far and when say that they have their "anger" and "mistrust" to "other."</seg>
<seg id="139">The man should not need: that, in the past, the present, we are not talking about "us" and "them."</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "us" and no "other."</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time disorder - that's all that we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"for which, to be honest with ourselves," dare to insert Эсме, "no part of society may well justify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="143">I do not accuse.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it is bad or good, what is done is done.</seg>
<seg id="145">Then it was back then.</seg>
<seg id="146">Nothing to speak - here we agree.</seg>
<seg id="147">And how not to blame anybody, we should not and excuses if it was appropriate or if it was something to fix.</seg>
<seg id="148">But why the past, if not to learn "</seg>
<seg id="149">Past Update to we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I can add to that one word -</seg>
<seg id="151">Great Pyramid Luther Рабиновица fallen apart.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I'll review your report", he said, by letting go of her.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, on the way to work, her knocked a biker who rode on the sidewalk, as described passers-by "in vicious rage."</seg>

<seg id="7">Markets will wait for the Bank a clear plan how to cope with a eurozone recovery, as well as the threat of deflation, with inflation of just 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation that the head of the ECB Mario Draghi later this week may give further signals that he is contemplating scheme of quantitative easing in the eurozone, similar to those that have used the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although some growth is better than no growth, braking effect growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty in the manufacturers becomes more obvious," said Rob Dobson, senior economist public.</seg>

<seg id="83">I know that he does not like to remember it, but they are very close with six classmates, and they go to a gym from time to time and burn candles there.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was younger, he suffered from this - I remember he was lying on the couch, facing away from us, for hours.</seg>
<seg id="85">Did not sleep, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys. Дамиру now 17, he above me, nice, smart and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that a few hours I was so sure that he died and that I never see more.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I was able to recover from the explosion and rose to his feet, I огляделась, I saw hell around when parts of bodies were lying everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely sure that it is not possible to my little boy could survive in this hell.</seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember that I shouted to him:" Damir, Run, убегай ", but again I was so sure he heard me.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips, how to achieve a better quality of underwater photos and video</seg>
<seg id="2">If you want to take pictures or shoot video under the water, you have a number of options.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is waterproof "Point and Shoot," for example, Nikon Coolpix AW120, or экшн-камера, for example, GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I took these pictures on a family holiday with several cameras, all for the price of about $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">No matter what equipment you use, some rules have to comply with in order to achieve the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Перепроверяйте your equipment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you waterproof camera, make sure that case cameras and other tightly closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, set up their camera for the type of photos or video that you shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some cameras and camcorders have regimes shooting or object type that optimise exposure for затемненных underwater conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in the water, notice how deep your equipment can fall.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are only 5 feet, others - 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Look at our leadership ratings and digital cameras for both traditional and водонепроницаемых models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Remove a few frames - because many of them never get.</seg>
<seg id="14">The "point" have LCD that can help you assign pictures, while the экшн-камер they are usually not.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have LCD, it will be difficult to see under the water, and will be a random process.</seg>
<seg id="16">So do a few frames.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also, if your camera is serial shooting mode, which takes several frames with a slightly different plant exposition, use them.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">The amount of light is significantly reduced, the deeper you нырнете under water.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, stay at the surface, when you're shooting in the pool, a river or ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">It also will allow you to transfer more colors in the photos; the deeper you go far, the less color you will see.</seg>
<seg id="22">Подплывайте closer to objects.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is a great tip for shooting on the land, but he even more important under the water because of затемненных light conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">Especially important if you're shooting on экшн-камеру: this equipment often comes with a fixed, широкоугольной lens, which means that you have to get closer to objects, if you want to fill the frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was such a man, whose force of personality could shake all around, even in such a giant organization like the National Health Service.</seg>
<seg id="2">Консультирующий anaesthetist, he devoted his career deliverance patients from suffering illness and the tortures.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among those who spoke to him, recalls his wife, MI-6 officer who had to live with devastating effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that as long as Dr. passionate about being diagnosed and diseases, those who is mainly concerned about something totally different - pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, however, he was to those who suffer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I did not feel, as usual," he wrote in May last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was hard to find the strength.</seg>
<seg id="8">Struggling with symptoms similar to flu, he found that irritated reproaches his wife, Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want all happened sooner rather than later," said he.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Juliet left for a week, Lawson found it unusual and it is not clear why upset.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked colleague make X-rays chest.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks before he went skiing in the Alps first.</seg>
<seg id="14">The results of the X-rays came.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was mesothelioma, a terminal cancer, which affects плевру, or shell.</seg>
<seg id="16">For most cancers it is difficult to determine an exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although some smokers from lung, for example, not all patients lung cancer smoked.</seg>
<seg id="18">But with attributable to mesothelioma differently.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases the cause is contact with asbestos, grainy construction material, which once called "a miracle" but which, as we now know, mortally dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us mesothelioma - disease, which can be not to pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos, in the end, "material from the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in the UK since the 1960s, when these industrial ban came into force.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even when it has been used, only people from specific sectors worked in close contact with him: трубоизолировщики, builders, carpenters and docks, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">Industrial toxin from another era, he hardly seen as cause for concern today.</seg>
<seg id="25">But such a calm.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it turns out, is now at the peak of the epidemic мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="27">Here from мезотелиомы kills more people than in any other country on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the annual mortality rate about 2500 people, more than two times more people dying from the disease than as a result of road accidents.</seg>
<seg id="29">The annual number of deaths from мезотелиомы since 1980 and projected the number of deaths in the future in the UK</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason we feel his deadly consequences now, is that, although the use of asbestos illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), for the development of мезотелиомы go usually tens of years.</seg>
<seg id="31">And attack мезотелиомы is not limited to veterans specialties industrial construction.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was, and in many cases remains, laid in the house where we live, where we work, schools, where we learn, and shops, where we go shopping.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention in class, the level of prosperity, profession or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">Bastions of избранности, from the fashionable London department stores to private schools, as it turned out, not salvation.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parliamentary building is riddled with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even hospitals, which are meant to treat us, were reservoirs this deadly a carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was not трубоизолировщиком.</seg>
<seg id="39">In fact, he had to think where he could come into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he realized.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it seems that could be a lot of asbestos in tunnels in the hospital Guy, where I spent six years on it," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">All students, nurses, doctors and грузчики - used these тоннелями.</seg>
<seg id="43">I wonder how many of my peers expect the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">It was a question, to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.</seg>
<seg id="45">"of the four doctors, which we in the hospital Guy and have subsequently developed mesothelioma for the past five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I alone remained alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us expect this disease?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Лоусону was diagnosed with "mesothelioma" when he was 48 years old.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">To live so long.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty percent attributable to mesothelioma patients die in 8 months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">She always lethal.</seg>
<seg id="52">So, now we can only repeat question Лоусона: "how many of us expect the same disease?"</seg>
<seg id="53">According to a leading expert in the UK, Professor Джулиану мезотелиоме Пито, most likely assume that between 1970 and 2050, when asbestos epidemic in Britain should an himself, will die about wealthy people.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most now are that die that way.</seg>
<seg id="55">Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada Alamy</seg>
<seg id="56">Fastest reports from halls Court where victims often seek compensation, shows how far spread attack мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="57">In this June, for example, Marks & Spencer acknowledged that the have Джэнис Ellen contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked in the nine years from 1978 to 1987, clothing departments at two sites, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs Ellen was only 18 years old when she started work at M & S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now her two children older than 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="61">"before this happened," she says, "I never heard about мезотелиоме, I barely knew about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="62">Me in the head and could not come, it will affect me.</seg>
<seg id="63">Few people really know a lot about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="64">In fact, asbestos is not one substance, and a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">They get their name from the word "асбестиформ" which means fibrous structure that informs them strength and flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="66">Of these six, three were often used in construction.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, much more often than other occurs in buildings today.</seg>
<seg id="68">It has been used in roofing panels, outdoor, thermal insulation, boiler pipes and toilets, even in the hundred cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">He less смертелен than other forms of asbestos, but still recognized as the EU and the World Health Organization "serious source of damage health," which can lead to death.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, brown asbestos (амозит) and blue asbestos (крокидолит).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that "there are good, though indirect reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with attributable to mesothelioma [in the UK]."</seg>
<seg id="72">Employee Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the main company shop on Oxford Street, London Alamy</seg>
<seg id="73">Джэнис Ellen may not thought of myself as a typical victim мезотелиомы, but the work Julian Пито suggests that her story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that "a significant percentage of мезотелиом when there is no known impact at work or at home, were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment."</seg>
<seg id="75">Most of this impact, he says, is "a normal use and exposure to weather" in our building.</seg>
<seg id="76">No one, it seems, can be sure that he is safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">The report Goddard Consulting, which was considered Westminster Palace, demonstrates how people, even in the heart of government, could be exposed to unconsciously.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines for the premises of parliamentary committees were infected with asbestos, deadly fibres which could contain in motion something so harmless as "strong flows of air."</seg>
<seg id="79">Members of parliament is that they pursue their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.</seg>
<seg id="80">Although Directorate for Parliament insisted that Westminster Palace received a "clean bill," now she recognized that it is necessary to work on the £1 billion on reconstruction of Parliament, by upgrading electrician and removing asbestos, and that after the general election 2015 members of parliament, will meet in the conference centre and their fertility rates collapse nearby, and not on the green benches was.</seg>
<seg id="81">The report Goddard noted that "the situation with asbestos is not Poland in accordance with different rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">It is impossible to know whether this error management cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All you can do is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">One of those who have not managed to identify his contact with asbestos, is Graham cost, the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson, the cost, 50 years, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I worked at the hospital, which successfully brought claims associated with asbestos," he says, "But I can't prove this in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It's so hard to remember all the places where he worked, and dates.</seg>
<seg id="88">He remembers clearly, so this day in early December 2009 when his wholly overcame something that was like the flu.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and he was in the middle of operations late in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly were shaken as me.</seg>
<seg id="91">It started very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terrible.</seg>
<seg id="93">I thought I can't drive all the way home.</seg>
<seg id="94">The cost of being a doctor, knew that pain comes from including checking for iframe loads, shell around the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="95">However, like Джэнис Ellen, he just did not have reason to suspect мезотелиому.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the end, he could not walk to work a month.</seg>
<seg id="97">US doctors doing chest x-rays and плевральные катетеры to pull fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis.</seg>
<seg id="98">And yet his condition оставлось without diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">Gradually his health improved and he returned to work.</seg>
<seg id="100">But from time to time the same symptoms returned, often after he was sports and was breathing hard.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, one of the patients Эбботта came to him in office with similar symptoms, and he was later diagnosed with "mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="102">But even then the cost not linked it with its own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">In the end, his patient was on dozens of years older and worked with asbestos directly.</seg>
<seg id="104">The connection in this case was obvious.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011 the Эбботта deteriorated again, and консультировавший his doctor showed him the results of the CT and X-ray images group of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, exactly two years after the cost began to feel ill, sensor, camera, was introduced in the cavity between the shell of his chest and shell his light.</seg>
<seg id="107">I'm an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I usually just go further, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="109">I'm not too upset about it, to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife, experienced.</seg>
<seg id="111">The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I have said that it is mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham cost mesothelioma diagnosis:</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly cost sank in meetings with nurses Macmillan, one of which suggested he contact a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">It was then he realised the scale of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"it turns out that asbestos is widely used, especially in large public buildings, where quite often was asbestos once on the pipes," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">People who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings, now get sick this disease.</seg>
<seg id="117">Thus, mesothelioma now affects more young people нетипичных professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous isolated asbestos pipes in hospitals were in basements, however it is unlikely that affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees, the tunnels connecting nearby landmasses can bring together to get from one building to another (as Andrew Lawson), or ate in the basements of canteens (how often did Graham cost) almost certainly really were exposed to toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">For several decades after the war, it turns out, hospitals were a place where, in theory, pulled life for поциентов, but place that constituted a threat to life for doctors who treated them.</seg>
<seg id="121">His still continue to remove today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students set their burners Бунзена rotates on asbestos</seg>
<seg id="123">And it is not only hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and мэриях because of their amazing insulating and if characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="125">Schools too.</seg>
<seg id="126">In fact, many, most likely, for the first time were exposed to asbestos in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="127">Across the country, countless lessons chemistry, students set their burners Бунзена on asbestos cradle.</seg>
<seg id="128">There were websites highlighting the problem of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as floor tiles or roof сараев usually contained asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"this is an industrial poison, in a huge number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Лоусона in a case against hospitals Guy.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case the only contact that could remember woman, was the demolition garden shed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So be careful, снося garden sheds.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effect of the diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is huge.</seg>
<seg id="134">"to realize it, is quite a lot of time," says Graham cost.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to continue, but realized that I could not focus on what I do.</seg>
<seg id="136">I stayed in surgery two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I realized that I have to go and deal with them.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I don't meet Christmas</seg>
<seg id="139">One of the most difficult things was the transition from doctor to patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">As countless patients before him, he remembers was confused information that should have been.</seg>
<seg id="141">"it was difficult to understand," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked your doctor" How many I have time? "</seg>
<seg id="143">Gave me about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember I thought, "Well, I no longer meet Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's all. "</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, as it is the mechanics of how we are in life, "the very act of breathing - causes cancer, which kills.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases мезотелиомы caused by contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos consists of tiny fibers.</seg>
<seg id="149">When asbestos is being destroyed and carcinogenic fibers, they can get stuck in плевре, shell.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibers are annoying плевру and can cause mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the problem occurs because of breathing the needle fibers of asbestos," Professor Tom Трежер, кардиоторакальный surgeon, who came in 2001 in hospital Guy.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is the hospital, where, as suspected Andrew Lawson, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, the leading centre for treatment мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="153">Трежер knew Лоусона and treated some other who probably was exposed to while in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">When Sally Goodin Sally goodun Etc asbestos in lung tissue, says Трежер, "breathing them unload on the periphery, where is the shell.</seg>
<seg id="155">This basically invasive process from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="156">Conventional treatments of other forms of cancer is much less effective in мезотелиоме.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of surgery, for example, cause hot debate.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some think it should try.</seg>
<seg id="159">Трежер does not agree.</seg>
<seg id="160">"you can't cut плевру," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">Around it is good with a knife.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, this cancer is "not very well is chemotherapy," which "acts", but not people.</seg>
<seg id="163">"from time to time there are patients who live a long time," says Трежер.</seg>
<seg id="164">But in the end, they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some patients are living much, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">Writer Stephen Jay Gould who died 20 years after he was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years after diagnosis, Graham cost continues to fight.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he became ill attributable to mesothelioma, Эбботта acquainted with Andrew Лоусоном, which, four years after diagnosis, single-handedly turned into offices support and consultation for these same patients.</seg>
<seg id="169">"yes, Раковая cheerfully Central," he said, when they called.</seg>
<seg id="170">"he was very positive," says the cost.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was diagnosed four years ago, and he still is very energetic.</seg>
<seg id="172">First Эбботту offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and would have prolonged his life only a month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was in despair," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, "managed to give the somewhat more positive agenda."</seg>
<seg id="176">Meeting with several specialists, cost decided to continue treatment with Professor Лоиком Ланж-Лаздунски, professor institutes in hospital Guy.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we had the advantage that I don't need it, I just called them, and they took me," admits Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">Likely the patient would have to get the direction and approval for funding.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money play a crucial role for patients with attributable to mesothelioma to get the best available treatment.</seg>
<seg id="180">However, when such treatment, finally, inevitably are ineffective, many patients face another financial cause for concern "about the future of families that they will leave.</seg>
<seg id="181">And then they ask the courts for compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Price Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"it has been known that asbestos is harmful for health, since 1898," says Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But that changed in the 1960s, is that it became clear that even very small amounts of could expose health risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">It was then the bad faith.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and hospital Guy eventually resolve the case, but this was not "settlement at full cost," according to Morgan, as Lawson could not clearly prove that his mesothelioma was a result of contact with asbestos in hospital Guy.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation into his death, a representative of the hospital Guy still confirmed, however, that "asbestos in the basement, about, was removed in the 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="188">It was too late for Andrew Лоусона.</seg>
<seg id="189">How to asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">In fact, tie deadly contact with asbestos to one company or place of work - usually through dozens of years after that - was a big problem for patients with attributable to mesothelioma requiring compensation.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have the owner or closed down.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance archives could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who is protected from lawsuits, know that on their side, which plaintiffs, of course, no.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, this year took serious new legislative acts which facilitate patients with attributable to mesothelioma process recovery of compensation, even if their former employers can not be tracked.</seg>
<seg id="195">In accordance with this law, was created £350-миллионный fund of funds, which is financed by the insurance industry for those who was diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact, but who are not with whom to sue.</seg>
<seg id="196">In such cases, patients will receive 80 percent of the amount that the court could award in a case about compensation - about £pirates.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected each year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with attributable to mesothelioma, believes that £350 million represent a "very good work" for the industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"this is the deal, written by companies for insurers," he says, hinting that the sum is a quarter of that insurers would have to pay, if not intervened time and sick with attributable to mesothelioma could track the company and file a lawsuit.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even Mike Пеннинг, previously minister for work and pensions, acknowledged that the law "is imperfect."</seg>
<seg id="201">But Пеннинг, and Morgan recognize that, with seven people die every day, rapid action was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="202">"people suffer so much, and they need help today," said Пеннинг during the second reading of the Bill about мезотелиоме in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">By the time Graham cost was in the hands of Professor Лоика Ланж-Лаздунски 19 months.</seg>
<seg id="204">After primary consultations Ланж-Лаздунски recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Трежера, he believes.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was followed by radiation for and chemotherapy - тритерапия in which Ланж-Лаздунски boasts all 40 percent of patients surviving for five years.</seg>
<seg id="206">The cost felt a surge of strength.</seg>
<seg id="207">"this is, of course, one of the most important things," says the cost.</seg>
<seg id="208">You see this in patients all the time.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is a force that supports you.</seg>
<seg id="210">When сдаешься, condition can deteriorate very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham cost went to the surgery in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">By the end of August he finished the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">Subsequent scan showed no trace of disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had a scan in March [2014].</seg>
<seg id="215">There were several spots [cancer] in my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I just was within reach 50.</seg>
<seg id="217">This is not a threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="218">This is the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="219">And again the cost went through six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now there is no trace of tumors.</seg>
<seg id="221">However, this process as physically and emotionally heavy.</seg>
<seg id="222">You can think about practical things - about finance, when I die, for example, or that we need to show his wife how timer on a big PRB.</seg>
<seg id="223">When you get bad news, you become безрадостным.</seg>
<seg id="224">You need to look forwards.</seg>
<seg id="225">As his father Ellie, 16 years old, and Тэмзин, 14 years, it is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">"it's difficult for parents," he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.</seg>
<seg id="228">For the first time when I was diagnosed, I told the girls that I had the disease, which means that I shall not live for up to old age.</seg>
<seg id="229">They reacted very differently.</seg>
<seg id="230">Тэмзин very gregarious and energetic.</seg>

<seg id="233">It did not say much.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters promise revenge</seg>
<seg id="2">China's parliament decided Sunday to not allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reforms.</seg>
<seg id="3">Such a move is likely to mark the beginning of a long promised protests in Hong Kong as activists began planning and mobilization in a matter of hours after that statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the 11th National People's Congress, in fact, communist leaders to remove all the candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it's not обмануло our expectations, but still leads in rage," said legislator Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's not what Beijing promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">They lied to the people of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is obvious that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defending the decision of China, Li Fey, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the 11th National People's Congress, said that to allow public nomination for election of the head of the Hong Kong would be too "protests."</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing promised to allow residents of the region to choose by voting the head of government, starting in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chinese leaders have presented the Sunday decision as a democratic step forward, as it gives гонконгцам right to direct the vote; however, the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process in his hands with the commission to the candidates, rigidly controlled from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, according to a new article, only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be admitted.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision was taken after the summer, when there have been some of the most large-scale and have received broad publicity protests in Hong Kong for many years.</seg>
<seg id="14">For a large part of after campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, which threatened to cut off the financial district in Hong Kong if Beijing does not guarantee of this universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sunday night, a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central gathered in the rain to Hong Kong government headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="16">The demonstration organizers announced that their movement is moving to a new phase of civil disobedience and that they rise up on the waves of protest in subsequent weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, they have not reported the details, obviously, to avoid problems with government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In онлайн-заявлении organizers reported that movement "обдумывало capture any central district only as exceptional measures, action that can be taken only if all the possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We regret to inform you that today, all possibilities have been exhausted and the dialogue is central district.</seg>
<seg id="20">Public authorities in Hong Kong were preparing to Beijing a few days, and on Sunday at the headquarters of the government were reinforced security measures involving police and barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">The unrest is the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their own city.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also increases fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, begin to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some criticize the movement Occupy Central, saying that his demonstration to jeopardize business is the lifeblood of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="25">"protest, which they say, it can result in a large economic damage, depending on how many people will participate and how long," said lawmaker Regina Yip, which long ago criticizes movement.</seg>
<seg id="26">We do not want to spread anxiety that Hong Kong out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This view, which is harmful for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chinese state media also gave reports in recent days in which Hong Kong activists democratic movement were shown диверсантами considering Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral law, which drew 7th participants - more than one-fifth of voters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="30">In July tens of thousands came out to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists raise the question of race and behaviour of the police after Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">Unarmed teenager was killed police officer in Фергюсоне, Missouri, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">Coming raise hands, chanting: "hands up, don't стреляй" while they wait in line in.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Фергюсоне, Missouri, teenager Michael Brown killing 45 blogger Miriam зоила Perez noticed the shift in интернет-разговоре among white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">In her experience, white feminists stamps comments put gender above race, when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, as was growing tension in the Midwest and attracted national attention, Peres saw answers white women who focused 100 percent on the race.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared with the reaction of black women shortly after the killing on 9 August, personal essays with such titles as "thoughts about Фергюсоне from white women" and "Феминизм is not only about угнетении women" appeared relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Peres they demonstrated a significant shift.</seg>
<seg id="9">"in feminism, I don't think there are many people who are talking about white skin and Privileges on such a high level," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People feel the need to say something about what happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is a very symbolic for the crisis with which we are faced, and because (the situation in Фергюсоне) is so tied to race, they felt that it should be.</seg>
<seg id="12">For Professor of English at the University of Ohio Кориты Mitchell Ferguson has laid bare problems that blacks American mother face every day, but which are not perceived as "women's problems" in the cultural sphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner and get 150 лайков from everywhere," says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">When I write something about how colored people are under assault in his own country, silence clearly.</seg>
<seg id="15">"why women safely publicly talk about relationships, but not about security in the public sphere?" she asks.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women, like Mitchell, who studied questions of race, gender and sexuality in US history, there is no dichotomy between issues relating to race and gender issues.</seg>
<seg id="17">From their point of view, blacks, women are in a position to clearly separate the problems; they are faced with a complex reality every day.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women now bring together issues of race and gender in feminist мейнстриме, Энджела Хэттери, professor of women's and gender studies at the University of George Mason, said that their predecessor did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"between 1865 and 1890 years линчевали at least 10,000 black men, and the base that is almost always served as the rape of white women," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="20">Need a white woman, was the story to justify Nepal.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the point of view of Хэттери, the gap between white and black women occurred when white суфражистки, for example, Susan B. Anthony looked at the situation in the late 1800s, and saw that the fight for suffrage will be effective only for one of the groups: women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"they decided to lay eggs in a basket voting rights for women and the right to vote for blacks would appear later," told Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="23">To look back on such things gives us a clear idea of why colored women don't trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We did nothing good.</seg>
<seg id="25">We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to white women united against mob lynchings of the women of the South for preventing mob lynchings.</seg>
<seg id="27">This group appeared nearly 40 years after blacks women for the first time asked to help, said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">From the point of view of Mitchell, the reactions of white feminists on problems raised situation in Фергюсоне, "the behavior of the police, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white a feminist had to" catch up "problems that blacks women cope in several generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is true, it would be great if a militant, have such a [traditional феминистическая] ideology, would seriously for the right to educate a child, as they relate to the right to contraception?" asked Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="30">The second wave feminists who made careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to контрацептивам, now are beginning to understand what that means.</seg>
<seg id="31">Known white activist феминистического movement Gloria Стайнем two weeks after the killing of Michael Brown took Фейсбуком and published a sharp article колумнистки Guardian Rebecca Carroll to white Americans took more participation in protests on racism.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope that women who have the other, but a similar reason to understand the danger in the body, and points of view to racial problems that significantly differ in surveys of the public - will be at the head of the change," wrote Стайнем.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Стайнем guarantee for the more пересекающийся feminism, which includes and problems of race and gender, her comments about race in America still fascinate some.</seg>
<seg id="34">American entrepreneurial Institute researcher Christina Соммерс, author of "Who stole feminism?," She The People that young men in the United States, especially colored young people, "is much more vulnerable than their sisters," but the value Стайнем Фергюсоне contradict criticism, which it clear earlier.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">But when the White House recently initiated a small program, "Сторож my brother" to help vulnerable black and испаноговорящим changed remarkably young men, followed the reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Стайнем.</seg>
<seg id="37">Police relationship with the black community is not the only problem, продвигающая helm of traditional feminism.</seg>
<seg id="38">After border the United States arrested around 63000 minors without the south-western border countries this year, immigration reform again came to the surface - this time as the problem of women.</seg>
<seg id="39">Andrea Меркадо, co-chair of the organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to apply this problem as important for women, she had only to share stories immigrant women.</seg>
<seg id="40">"they speak for themselves," said Меркадо.</seg>
<seg id="41">When the vast majority of working visas are issued [иммигрантам-мужчинам], women who come with them, find themselves in positions, vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="42">"these stories find resonate with women's organizations," she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Economic Development Ministry wants to accelerate the growth of the market between</seg>
<seg id="2">This week the Ministry of Economic Development will make the government a comprehensive plan for the development of clean transport in Russia, told the deputy director of the Ministry of Oleg Плужников the Round Table, which held the newspaper Vedomosti at the Moscow show - 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">The plan drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals - reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is expected that the document will be passed in late September and early October, says Плужников, proposed measures concern the electric cars and hybrids - development plan for газомоторном fuel in Russia already have.</seg>
<seg id="5">The plan (a copy of Vedomosti) is designed for 2014-2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">Evaluation criteria to develop electricity and hybrid transport and decide how to promote the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">The government report, which will be described tax and customs support measures for quality, will be prepared by December 2014; the concessional lending and preferential leasing will appear by April 2015; and proposals to reduce prices, stimulate and create a service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014-2015, it is expected to make changes to the regulations to ease conditions for construction charge infrastructure (after, filling stations, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, federal officials intend to for 2015 to formulate proposals for regional authorities to also promote the use of clean transport - in the form of granting him benefits in movement and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and the expansion of government purchases of such transport.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, the Ministry of Economic Development by October 2014 will make in the list of indicators of regional authorities criteria that reflect the effectiveness of support production of environmentally clean transport, development charge infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="11">Single market in Russia is still only formed in 2013 throughout the country sold about 100.</seg>
<seg id="12">In early 2014 обнулена an import duty on electric cars, so sales will be approximately 500 pieces, predicts CEO of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey Pankov.</seg>
<seg id="13">But opened growth makes electric cars any visible: in 2013 in Russia, according to the Association of European Businesses, sold segment million cars and light commercial vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="14">While in Russia Sunderland imports only Mitsubishi Motors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Start import is preparing Renault - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says director of strategic planning and partnerships Renault in Russia Nicolas Ремиз.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most of the other manufacturers of electric transport took in respect of Russia taking a wait-and-see approach.</seg>
<seg id="17">The development of electric cars have and Russian manufacturers GAZ directors, "", "," but the мизерный.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in January - July 2014, according to the "АСМ-холдинга," Avtovaz released 30.</seg>
<seg id="19">Demand is also degrading because of cost, admits director of AvtoVAZ the pharmaceutical Sergei Аманов, without state support the breakthrough in this segment will not.</seg>
<seg id="20">The development of the Russian market in electric cars in addition to the cost of cars (those electric cars that are sold in Russia, on average, twice as much as analogues with internal combustion engine) is poor charge infrastructure (retails sites - units), sighs of "Автостата" Sergei Целиков.</seg>
<seg id="21">Because of cost and low rate of electric cars cost in the next 3-4 years remain нишевым segment of the Russian market, forecasts editor in chief "Авторевю" Mikhail Подорожанский, Целиков agrees with him.</seg>
<seg id="22">Car manufacturers, in contrast, say that some models of electric cars are close to normal.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Russian market between good prospects, the important thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "электромобильность" real; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of new charging stations, underscores the President of BMW in Russia Wolfgang Шлимме.</seg>
<seg id="24">Such infrastructure projects implements, for example, the "Россети": in Moscow several stations, soon there will be about 80.</seg>
<seg id="25">Negotiations on building the network retails sites are and with other regions.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to Director of "Россетей Vladimir Софьина, the company believes the single market and is ready to build gas stations across the country, but there are problems: a small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging different brands.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, "Россети" as network company cannot engage in sale of electricity, to do it in relation to charging.</seg>
<seg id="28">Pankov believes the most effective measure state support of the formation of the single market progeSOFT customs duties.</seg>
<seg id="29">Zero rate will act before the end of 2014, its extension, expansion of preferential list.</seg>
<seg id="30">Replacement transport tax on ecological (the idea is being discussed and concerns all machines) also will support the market, but not as noticeably as customs preferences, said Pankov.</seg>
<seg id="31">Vehicle tax in Russia is small, said Pankov, unlike, for example, from Norway, where the tax has led to a sharp increase in electric sales - now they account for 12% of the market.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia need and stimulus measures to, for example free parking in the city centre (as already made in Moscow), I am sure Pankov, or any single of dedicated lanes, which in Russia.</seg>

<seg id="3">All known for a long time: we are talking "Belgium" - mean mussels, we say "mussels" mean "Belgium".</seg>
<seg id="4">Restaurant like глубокомысленно say that the success of schools depends on three factors: this cocktail and again.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are some places, not that good, and even great, but any невезучие.</seg>
<seg id="6">In short, the Palm, I remembered that once there was a cafe "am" (in honor of the TV shows), then "its" and "Beaujolais" and beer "Friendship".</seg>
<seg id="7">Now here again beer, but not ностальгически-советская, and Belgian.</seg>
<seg id="8">Above ground there is only the tip of the iceberg: and a couple of tables, all the rest space devoid of even the hint of sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="9">But here, as in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, colourful, instead of windows - TVs, where swim девушки-русалки.</seg>
<seg id="10">Belgian institution in St. Petersburg has long been not in novelty, so to compare with it.</seg>

<seg id="1">The dollar rose on MICEX above 37 rubles on news about upcoming West new sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2">It's a new historical record.</seg>
<seg id="3">The dollar calculations "tomorrow" to 10: 29 Moscow time grew to 26.9 cents and was 37,02 ruble, the euro was rising by 30 kopecks to 48,73 ruble, the Moscow stock exchanges.</seg>
<seg id="4">Бивалютная basket grew by 28 cents to the level of the previous closing and cost 42,28 ruble.</seg>
<seg id="5">The dollar was up to Crimean events high on February 19, 2009 - then he cost 36,43 ruble, and on March 3, 2014, he was already 37,005 ruble.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the night of August 29, the White House said that President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed the possibility of introducing additional sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The weakening of the ruble is a long-term character, and in tandem with the euro, and in tandem with the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="8">The long-term forecast assumed this mark, "says senior analyst" Alpari "Anna Bodrov's.</seg>
<seg id="9">Everything that has to do with Ukraine, one way or another will be reflected on the courses.</seg>
<seg id="10">As long as this continues, investors will respond.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, rumors about the invasion troops not confirmed nor on the one hand, but the market was very emotional.</seg>
<seg id="12">All talk about the fact that he was resistant to such news, yesterday were перечеркнуты.</seg>
<seg id="13">Week, according to forecasts, will be closed around these levels - 36,90 and 37,05 roubles to the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="14">The tax period ended, oil prices weak, policy, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine are all links in the same chain.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also the forecast inflation: to current prices for the autumn by end-2010 from 5 to 10%.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon, moreover, are seasonal vegetables and fruits, and a vacuum until network переориентируются on other suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="17">"the dollar went up to 37 rubles, passed it and came back, some powerful hysteria," said head of markets "Opening Broker Konstantin Bushuev.</seg>
<seg id="18">Will still watch, will enter on Saturday promised sanctions, as will meet NATO.</seg>
<seg id="19">The ruble, according to him, weakened sharply after the tax season, then went news on Ukraine, the Central Bank last week said that before the end of the year to a floating exchange rate and waives any currency interventions.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you look at daytime wobble, it is no different from previous during this month, all have spooked the mark in 37 rubles, "analyst.</seg>
<seg id="21">And so, in terms of turnover nothing powerful has not happened.</seg>
<seg id="22">Worrying times for currency market were, I remind you, when at the end of January, though the currency, as well as the third of March, when the Central Bank отгрузил a record number of currency.</seg>
<seg id="23">In UFS IC see the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="24">First of all, this increase in the revenue part of the budget from the export operations, as well as to increase the competitiveness of domestic manufacturers at the expense of more expensive imports, says principal analyst at UFS IC Alexei Kozlov.</seg>
<seg id="25">The negative points include doubling of the price of imported goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of the investment in the Russian economy, growing inflationary pressure and, as a result, become the cause of more expensive borrowing money, which, in turn, slows down the country's economic development.</seg>
<seg id="27">In terms of market shares, devaluation of the ruble several smoothes over fall in share prices, expressed in rubles.</seg>
<seg id="28">For example, MICEX index during trading Thursday fell 1.67%, and the RTS Index lost 3.27%.</seg>
<seg id="29">Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of reduction of indices due to the weakening ruble during the day more than 1.5%.</seg>
<seg id="30">The weakening of the ruble is an emotional character and explains mass desire to buy currency.</seg>
<seg id="31">In practice, gradually emotions go to, and quotes ruble partially or fully restore lost ground.</seg>
<seg id="32">"believe, soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency near level of 36 rubles to the dollar," said Alexei Kozlov.</seg>

<seg id="1">The tax burden on entrepreneurs Washington zone is growing as economic recovery</seg>
<seg id="2">Восстанавливающаяся economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Account for taxes on the state and local level for companies across the country, moderately increased in the past year, when accelerated the recovery, according to a new study, published last week, and companies in the Washington area is no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion in treasury of the state and local level in fiscal 2013, to 3.8 percent more than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tax burden on business in the state and local level last year increased by 4.3 percent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent the year before, and it was the third straight year of growth after avoiding each other years when smaller accounts in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">Taxes, grew faster, 4.3 percent than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to the research, which was held firm, professional services, Ernst & Young and the Center for taxation, the tax policy.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of tax revenue in the District, 56 percent, in taxes on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of tax revenue in Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the amount of tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="10">To a large extent, the growth of tax revenues caused by return to same level of the value of real estate companies, researchers say that raised property taxes by 3.7 percent this year, after three years in a row, when growth was less than 1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large share of these revenues in large states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same thing is happening in the Washington area.</seg>
<seg id="12">Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion property taxes on the state and local level in the past year, to $9.6 billion more than in 2012 - a growth of 4.2 percent, compared with the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the observed return value at real estate has a similar effect on the growth of tax revenues for the state and local level in Maryland, where property taxes barely exceed one-fifth of the tax bills of companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">Virginia and the District of Columbia pay tax accounts for about half of the state and local level, in the form of property taxes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"what is happening in Maryland is that such a large part of their real estate, especially tax base around the District of Columbia, belongs to either the government or nonprofit organization, which does not pay property taxes," said Douglas Линдхолм, executive director of the Center on taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, Maryland forced to much more rely, for example, on income taxes to pay for the same service in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent growth in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot fully explain the recovery of the real estate market.</seg>
<seg id="18">Income entrepreneurs also, it seems, is going to be, according to this data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Chinese companies may increasingly raise capital in the corporate income tax to the state of $2.3 billion to $2.1 billion more than in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland has collected $1 billion corporate income tax, the most in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although trends directed in one direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase with the same speed in all three areas.</seg>
<seg id="22">The level of growth in the District of Columbia was on the same level as the average across the country, 4.3 percent, while growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only in Virginia was the rise of tax revenues below average, 4.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">In Virginia was the lowest corporate income tax from three jurisdictions (each of which the same corporate rate) equal to 6 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Maryland corporate rate of 8.25 percent, while in the district it relatively high - 9,975 percent.</seg>
<seg id="26">Like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that in Virginia lower taxes for entrepreneurs on the state and local level and, in general, more favorable climate in terms of taxes for entrepreneurs than in Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="27">District not assessed in this study.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite its advantage, Virginia is competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south.</seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina recently signed a legislative act that corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="30">If the state will continue to reach goals on tax moves into the country in the next year, this law could bring rate income tax for entrepreneurs even to 3 percent by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="31">Meanwhile, a small business in the Washington area, it seems, feels better and thus pay more taxes on the state and local level, according to a recent study.</seg>
<seg id="32">Taxes for entrepreneurs, paid in the form of individual income tax the owners of small businesses - a transitional structure, the things most small firms - in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, with much greater speed growth than taxes for предпринимателй in general.</seg>
<seg id="33">Researchers say the trend and an increase in revenues from taxes on businesses across the country are likely to persist this year, when tax revenues in the state and local level, the 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.</seg>
<seg id="34">However Вашингтонская zone can fail, as reducing federal spending affects the labor market in the region.</seg>

<seg id="15">And this was not necessarily bad, on the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="16">Force Royal Blood that they do not claim the idea of new Lennon and McCartney (rather very mark in successors Motörhead), but brought numerous рок-дуэты from ghetto инди-клубов.</seg>

<seg id="3">He developed a system of how to take books of старшекурсников, offering them rated compensation that they delayed their sale.</seg>
<seg id="4">"my textbook on mathematical analysis, which usually costs $180, I received for a semester for $10 and biscuits" Chick-fil-A "," says Schroeder, 19 years who learns in Ковенант College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The literature on last semester cost would be $430, he says.</seg>
<seg id="6">He spent $120.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the Council of the colleges, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and training, but the students have a number of options to reduce these costs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Students increasingly choose online stores and creative ideas, such system ’.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rent books is becoming more popular, allowing students to use a book during the semester, and often costs significantly cheaper than buying them.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Нибо Инкорпорейтид", which holds more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of rental books increased twice since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">Industry studies show that about a quarter of books in university bookstores during the past spring semester were taken, says vice president "Нибо" Trevor Meyer.</seg>

<seg id="13">Here's introductory course on the best ways to make a bargain.</seg>
<seg id="14">Purchase in store</seg>
<seg id="15">Sometimes, if you'll come out in the Internet, the price of a new book may be one third from the one that you will see in the university bookshop.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Mathematical analysis" Ron this, Bruce Edwards's and Robert Хостетлера worth about $290 privately, but a new instance of can be purchased for $239,99 on the site Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Buying a used</seg>
<seg id="18">If you are not against others' made or damage, second-hand textbooks is a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"mathematical analysis" sold for $93,49 in подержанном form on Chegg.com.</seg>

<seg id="21">The book sold for $48 new.</seg>
<seg id="22">Teachers, for example, Ingrid Брейси, director of "College without walls" at the University of Massachusetts in Эмхерсте, offers students refine their professors, you cannot use previous editions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes updates are insignificant.</seg>
<seg id="24">In such cases, old publications often can be found in a very small fraction of the cost of the last edition.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition to websites Amazon and Chegg, Half.com, "eBay Inc.," popular alternative to buy used books.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hire</seg>

<seg id="28">You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, a student could rent a "Математический analysis" for a semester for about $20.</seg>
<seg id="30">Find out the rules of the store, where you take books, including any fines that you can write for, underscore and damage.</seg>
<seg id="31">If you take a book, remember: if you do not upon a book, fines may even exceed the cost of the new instance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Electronic books</seg>
<seg id="33">Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks is another option.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sometimes such books actually take, purchasing electronic license for a certain period for retailers, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rent "Mathematical analysis" on the site Chegg.com for six months will cost about $61.</seg>
<seg id="36">Брейси says that students who study literature, often can find the best prices, as many classic works now you can download for free while literature on natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.</seg>
<seg id="37">No matter what, осмотритесь.</seg>
<seg id="38">Joe Голт, 29, who was going to begin study in Legal school Пеппердин, recommends that use ISBN number to book prices, as this ensures that you are looking for precisely the right you text.</seg>

<seg id="39">Санкционное menu</seg>
<seg id="40">On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of specific economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which is basically food sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="41">The country is prohibited import beef, pork, meat and offal names from poultry, meat, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cheese, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausage and sugar syrups.</seg>
<seg id="42">The restaurants began чехарда with suppliers: prices for products, to counterparts from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="43">This is impact on expensive restaurants with монокухней France, Italy, Spain, in which products supplied directly from the "maternal" countries.</seg>
<seg id="44">Общепиту had to education before.</seg>
<seg id="45">For example, when in early 2014 Rosselkhoznadzor banned import of Australian beef, and the year before - the American and Canadian meat.</seg>
<seg id="46">In return suppliers established supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="47">But sanctions лета-2014 were far more serious.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree that infer from the ban fry Atlantic salmon and trout, безлактозное milk, seed potatoes, сахарную corn, peas and onions for replanting.</seg>
<seg id="49">The Italian Валерио hopes that sanctions may even смягчиться.</seg>
<seg id="50">As long as part of the restaurants there is in conditions of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="51">According to the company "East-West", one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment accounted for up to 70%.</seg>
<seg id="52">"expensive restaurants have to change the menu under that produce local farmers and other countries," says Sergei Mironov, Resurrection, owner of the agency "Рестконсалт."</seg>
<seg id="53">If the strong, for him it's not going to be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="54">Only we have very little such chefs, and for the development of a new menu may take two or three months.</seg>
<seg id="55">From the restaurant Brasserie Тригель "Bridge" prepared: refuse will have from 10-15% dishes, even half of the menu - recycle.</seg>
<seg id="56">In restaurants with mixed kitchen are starting to replace dishes, for example steak from the marble beef - on Beef Stroganoff, says Sergei Mironov.</seg>
<seg id="57">"cheeses from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian, cheese, cheese from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," lists the "East-West" Oksana Глибчук.</seg>
<seg id="58">Cream and milk products from Europe have counterparts in Russia and Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="59">Chicken from the United States may be replaced by chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and семга from Norway - salmon, семгой, those from Belarus and Chile.</seg>
<seg id="60">The absence of vegetables and fruits of European production may be offset by a rise of domestic manufacturers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.</seg>
<seg id="61">According to Mironov, Budget network restaurants rebuild will be easier than премиальному segment: it is unlikely that there were all able to distinguish Italian mozzarella is from the Russian.</seg>
<seg id="62">Although it is difficult to have to establishments Ginza Project, he says.</seg>
<seg id="63">The Ginza Project a few dozen restaurants under different brands and with their menu.</seg>
<seg id="64">To replace leave plenty of time, "said Mironov.</seg>
<seg id="65">In Ginza comment refused, citing the lack of owners in the country.</seg>
<seg id="66">The owners of a cafe Caucasian and toppled a central kitchen stress that products from the former Soviet republics ароматнее European</seg>
<seg id="67">But a lot and restaurants, which sanctions almost hits.</seg>
<seg id="68">These include institutions with kitchen CIS: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.</seg>
<seg id="69">"the Georgian kitchen no expensive products," says Хатуна Колбая, owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and cafes "Vai мэ!".</seg>
<seg id="70">All cheeses for us do in Russia, the basis of many dishes - chicken breast, exotic herbs we don't use. "</seg>
<seg id="71">In institutions Колбаи until removed from the menu of dishes.</seg>
<seg id="72">Timur colon, owner of the restaurants "Чайхона N1" with Uzbek cuisine, sanctions also might alert: change he will have only sausages on New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="73">If Russia our owned imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we even win in price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="74">From the CIS can be cheaper to get to engineering, sausages, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit.</seg>
<seg id="75">The fact that brought from Central Asia, much better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="76">About Uzbek tomatoes all know that they are tasty, sweet.</seg>
<seg id="77">About Spanish no one says so.</seg>
<seg id="78">After sanctions representative Минсельводхоза Uzbekistan Олимбой Артыков said that plans to increase export плодовоовощной products to Russia twice by 2016.</seg>
<seg id="79">About its intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after sanctions said Belarus and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="80">Restaurants now that responded to the request "," Money ", also quite calmly respond to sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="81">The McDonald's said that localization exceeds 85% and network works with 160 Russian suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="82">According to Tatyana Богдановой, head of Department of working with suppliers of the Charles Bridge, about 80% of products network buys in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties in supply vegetables and increased prices for meat products that produce from the imported raw materials.</seg>

<seg id="90">Even in Georgian restaurants the dishes will grow by 5-10%, admits Колбая.</seg>
<seg id="91">"East-West" do not deny: "for example, the Belarusian milk products since August lowest by 10-15%."</seg>
<seg id="92">"Brazilian suppliers raised prices for pork almost two times," complains Sergei Cancer, Deputy General Director "Стардогс."</seg>
<seg id="93">Chicken legs chicken 35%.</seg>
<seg id="94">Expect prices from China, maybe they остудят hot Brazilian head.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the near future in "Стардогсе" will increase the prices by 8%.</seg>
<seg id="96">Is very undesirable to raise prices, "says Cancer.</seg>

<seg id="110">We are catching нерку, an easy way for software interaction, important, горбушу, it is "royal salmon."</seg>
<seg id="111">Yes, they are not as fat as the Norwegian salmon, because it is wild fish.</seg>
<seg id="112">Norwegian salmon is same aquaculture.</seg>
<seg id="113">His hands take - he didn't even stirs.</seg>
<seg id="114">And our Far Eastern salmon you in the hands do not retain.</seg>
<seg id="115">Only institutions without special claims agree to replace Italian mozzarella is domestic</seg>
<seg id="116">In the window of his tent's entrance lie prawns with биркой "Magadan", cod,, муксун, mussels with Crimea, manager from the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="117">Galkin is confident that it is high time to move on fish from the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="118">According to statistics, fishing in Russia in 2013 - more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="119">Imports of fish in 2013-м - about 800 thousand tons.</seg>
<seg id="120">Shop "his people" works with 2012, sells fish through the online store, before sanctions served even one and a half dozen restaurants, such as "Simple things."</seg>
<seg id="121">Now to Галкину received applications from 15 restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="122">The same land is you can do from our fish, "he горячится.</seg>
<seg id="123">We заморочились, tried different recipes.</seg>
<seg id="124">Now land sell through online store per million rubles a month.</seg>
<seg id="125">Our fish cheaper in a few times, and delivery is maximum 15 rubles per kilogram.</seg>
<seg id="126">In the tent bears me prepare portion of "Philadelphia" with кетой.</seg>
<seg id="127">Unlike rolls with семгой these account for longer chew, but consciousness that this fish, native to our forces.</seg>
<seg id="128">On the site shop "his people" have even note: recoil Keyserts from different islands can vary and sea окуня.</seg>
<seg id="129">In суши-барах, however, replace Norwegian salmon prefer Chilean.</seg>
<seg id="130">Galkin explains that поварам laziness to invent new recipes with Far East fish.</seg>
<seg id="131">"the Russian fish suppliers we have not yet offered," gives its explanation owner Killfish Bar Dmitri Evseev.</seg>
<seg id="132">About the same situation with other products: Russian producers could all niche, but this is not happening.</seg>
<seg id="133">According to founder and co-owner project LavkaLavka Boris Акимова, it can now be rather the imports from Europe and America imports from China, Israel and Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="134">There are large multinational corporations, which have a powerful logistics and large volumes.</seg>
<seg id="135">They can quickly replace blocked imports unlike our farmers.</seg>
<seg id="136">The ban will benefit primarily large manufacturers of other countries, "says Akimov.</seg>
<seg id="137">However, in the last month of the industry received and more alarming than food sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="138">The off-schedule audits of Rospotrebnadzor was temporarily suspended the activities of three companies McDonald's in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg.</seg>
<seg id="139">"we are studying the essence of claims claims to determine the actions necessary to open the restaurants for visitors," said "Деньгам" in McDonald's.</seg>
<seg id="140">No one really understands that will happen.</seg>
<seg id="141">If all the limited food sanctions, this is one option that you can survive, "said on condition of anonymity a restaurant consulting company.</seg>
<seg id="142">If we begin to close McDonald's across the country, the scenario will be quite different.</seg>

<seg id="2">Has to be to help with traffic - so the Central Bank intends to encourage the introduction of in Russia "европротокола."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Bank of Russia has developed the draft guidance, according to which, on 1 September this year to obtain payments on current has when you can do without help.</seg>
<seg id="4">It, however, is only about cases where the accident was framed by "европротоколу" without the participation of traffic police.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is, if the accident has only two cars, there is no physically affected persons, damage does not exceed the limit and both the driver reached consensus on who the culprit of the accident.</seg>
<seg id="6">2 August limit payments on "европротоколу" is 50 thousand, and from October 1, in Moscow, St. Petersburg and in the Moscow and Leningrad areas he will be promoted to 400 thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="7">The point is that sometimes, even with minor damage, in a situation where an accident can be on "европротоколу" drivers, in an accident, cause.</seg>
<seg id="8">Since when has the policy to refund without reference was traffic.</seg>
<seg id="9">Parameters laid out in the draft guidance, and are designed to eliminate this obstacle in the way of implementing "европротокола" in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to them, the maximum payout for has in connection with the accident, without police, must not be lower than the limit for "европротоколу."</seg>
<seg id="11">But she can't be above the limit, the treaty has insurance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The idea, of course, useful and theoretically capable of relieving as employees Smith and road.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it does not come in elation or car drivers, nor insurers.</seg>
<seg id="14">The last now talk about a serious threat to growth and fraud to which may result in the introduction of new rules has.</seg>
<seg id="15">As for the drivers, it is difficult to imagine what kind of work will have to do to overcome as the Russian conservatism.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driver in most cases will be hours to wait for inspectors, small accident because more robust.</seg>
<seg id="17">And it remains that will be easier - win swindlers or convince drivers in reliability "европротокола."</seg>
<seg id="18">Savings certificate will make personalised and irrevocable</seg>
<seg id="19">The Finance Ministry wants to block savings certificates on bearer, but will allow banks to make them the безотзывного contribution.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Finance Ministry is preparing a bill which would prohibit savings certificates to bearer.</seg>
<seg id="21">Recently, this tool is gaining popularity, as rates is higher than on bank deposits.</seg>
<seg id="22">The fact is that savings certificates for the deposit insurance system, and the bank they are cheaper because do not have to make payments to the Fund Deposit Insurance Agency (pointed).</seg>
<seg id="23">Successfully situation that this step will be taken because of the small and medium-sized banks, spreading such certificates, and will suffer from it Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which, according to pointed, control 98% of demand.</seg>
<seg id="24">And the share of Bank of Moscow, according to agencies, is about 3.5%.</seg>
<seg id="25">The problem, explains pointed out, is that customers a small bank that bought such a certificate, in case of withdrawal it licenses are trying to obtain money in pointed.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates on bearer, may assume that their investments are.</seg>
<seg id="27">Reasonable lack of insurance payments on these certificated in case of license revocation the bank can lead to misunderstandings and social tension.</seg>
<seg id="28">In practice, agencies were cases when holders предъявительских certificates tried to seek insurance redress through the court, "said in pointed.</seg>
<seg id="29">The problem, of course, made-up.</seg>
<seg id="30">For paying customers certificates still nobody will, as they have under the law, there is no right to compensation from the state.</seg>
<seg id="31">If the case was that the tool is insured in pointed, together with him banned would and metal accounts, which means citizens are in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.</seg>
<seg id="32">Since these accounts do not end up in the deposit insurance, but their existence until no one deprives.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is likely that certificates for are very comfortable, which actually can act as квазиденег.</seg>
<seg id="34">The move does not control: any client of the bank can buy a certificate to any citizen, and cashing such a certificate can change a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is not by chance that the draft that savings certificate should be a valuable paper, which must be stored in depositories.</seg>
<seg id="36">And Putin to 125,000 banks such certificates are allowed to release without the right to early redemption.</seg>
<seg id="37">That is a similar безотзывного contribution, which long dream of bankers.</seg>

<seg id="21">The press service of the High Representative of the Union for foreign policy and diplomacy Catherine Ashton failed to answer questions about what Brussels expects relations in the new format.</seg>
<seg id="22">A spokesman for Ashton Maya Косьянчич only said "Огоньку" that on issues of war and peace this topic is not a priority.</seg>
<seg id="23">While there were reports that the next meeting place for Ukrainian issue involving officials in the new format may be and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="24">A drop of tar for Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that about him, it turns out, personally asked the representatives of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, at the final briefing Alexander Lukashenko made it clear: all parties not against to Minsk remained the central platform for meetings in both format Россия--ОБСЕ--Украина and at the level of Heads of State and high representatives of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="26">This means that "the last dictator in Europe" acquires the status of quite рукопожатного European leader who helps to solve a global problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">Best friend European farmer</seg>
<seg id="28">Already the EU delegation, which included еврокомиссаров on trade and energy, in conclusion: the main underlying reason for the summit is not the tragic situation in Donbas, and economy.</seg>
<seg id="29">In fact, сверстанное meeting schedule future talks on the supply of gas and to overcome fears CU on the agreement about an association of Ukraine with the EU looks achievement more extensive than peace declaration without specific dates and numbers.</seg>
<seg id="30">Trade Commissioner Karl De Гюхт, however, on: EU officials "arrived in Minsk to find solution to the political crisis which has economic consequences, and not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="31">It seems, however, that in the economy, the crisis in Ukraine "works" for Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its consequences - and primarily mutual Western sanctions and Russia - give Minsk, who until he feels санкционное pressure, the room for maneuver.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to the head of the Mises Research Centre, Belarus Yaroslav Романчука, European investors actively interested in opportunities for the supply of agricultural products in Russia in bypassing sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="34">The nominated delivery scheme for which Vladimir Putin at the summit пожурил Minsk.</seg>
<seg id="35">"by these schemes," said Romanchuk "Огоньку," are not the Belarusian businessmen and Russian companies.</seg>
<seg id="36">They worked for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Russian business urgently need to somehow restore them, even through mediation Belarusian structures.</seg>
<seg id="38">The second story, "the expert continues," is associated with the fact that many Ukrainian companies not averse to establish production in Belarus of raw materials also with focusing on the Russian market.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Ukrainian producers about 4 billion of exports to Russia, and the Belarusian производственно-торговые schemes now may be very popular. "</seg>
<seg id="40">According to Романчука, the role of the host site for negotiations the EU and TC is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of the development of economic ties with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="41">He recalls that the loss of agricultural sector the EU sanctions against Moscow are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the Commission is currently proposed 5.45 only 125 million compensation.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Belarusian president to Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for еврофермеров.</seg>
<seg id="43">This can raise the authority of Lukashenko in the EU to unprecedented height.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hospitality without initiatives</seg>
<seg id="45">Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative for the summit.</seg>
<seg id="46">But the paradox is that Minsk from his active role in birth format TS + EU открещивается, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with Ukrainian counterpart emphasized that the new format and it became.</seg>
<seg id="47">"it was your suggestion to come, without any навала discuss, not with бухты-барахты decide, after signing the Association Agreement with the EU, understand the situation, which at that time was in Ukraine," he said, before the cameras to Peter Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, observers interpreted it as an attempt to calm Moscow, she reportedly was originally against mediation Minsk, which greatly increases its political weight.</seg>
<seg id="49">In Belarusian diplomatic establishment carefully stress that Belarus the interaction of the EU and on his land does not pursue a lucrative goals, and the ultimate goal of this format is to create in the future a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.</seg>
<seg id="50">"this is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts that in other areas, in particular in the field of security, and promotes the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation," said "Огоньку" in Belarus, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, where in recent years looks with words.</seg>

<seg id="18">The main problem Cities грехов-2 "is in another.</seg>
<seg id="19">Frank Miller was good, because both рисовальщик bed joined comic and нуар, and as a director, turned an idea of how to comics on the screen.</seg>
<seg id="20">Comic and нуар - two aggressively opposing "reality."</seg>

<seg id="34">It is neither the American version of Socialist Realism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The first "City of sins" was remarkable it is that desperate, but seamlessly joined comic with нуаром.</seg>
<seg id="36">For the first time on the screen comic came alive at this point, without their graphic nature and not pretended to be "real" film.</seg>

<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian government can give eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and an internal Ukrainian conflict."</seg>

<seg id="13">Moscow had to withstand much more heavy battle to attach even Donetsk and Луганскую region of eastern Ukraine, since most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian, and polls before the conflict showed a desire to remain within Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">Autonomy, which Russian diplomats discussed at international forums gave regional governments in the Ukraine power to trade agreements and foreign policy, in fact, passing the Kremlin actual control over the territory, which would teamed the main territory of Russia with unverifiable.</seg>

<seg id="19">The last call Putin to Kiev to negotiate with the leaders of the separatists, as with equal, followed new наступлениями rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks rolled into eastern Ukraine from formerly peaceful areas along the Azov Sea.</seg>
