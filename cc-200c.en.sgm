<seg id="1">Recalling a very American ideal that labor rights are human rights</seg>
<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis suggested that the bill, which is protected by the unions as a civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Where there are jobs, unions and the middle class," says Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, who is co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive factions.</seg>
<seg id="4">That is why I am proud to represent the Act of expanding the rights of workers, along with the symbol of the movement for civil rights by John Lewis.</seg>
<seg id="5">This innovative bill will give workers the same opportunities for legal discrimination against organizations that the trade unions and other forms of discrimination, opponents of stopping union power</seg>
<seg id="6">Changing the law on regulating labour relations in such a way as to allow the workers encountering discrimination for participation in trade union organizations, to seek justice in the civil courts - and receive compensation and punitive damages payments - a sensible and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it's certainly not radical initiative - at least by American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the best way to understand the fact that offer Ellison, Lewis and co-authors of the bill, "recall is a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the attacks, which the unions have been subjected to in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country, Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, to expand and to respect human rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country simultaneously defend democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas MacArthur and his assistants have helped the country to adopt a constitution, so convinced that, in order to ensure that the command of autocracy Хидеки Тодзё was replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included text that explicitly acknowledged that "the right of workers to organize and to negotiate, and the collective action is guaranteed."</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Эйзенхауер and his assistants have helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that fascism Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recognizing that workers will need to be organized and be heard in the new state, Germans have included an article, which openly stated: "The right to establish associations in order to protect and improve employment and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict or seek to diminish that right, will have no legal force; measures to this end, may be declared illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">When former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which was World Declaration on Human Rights, which will be adopted in 1948 by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and included stating that "everyone has the right to organize and join unions to protect their interests."</seg>
<seg id="17">Generations of Americans take for granted our basic position that labor rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country was advised by other countries about how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans have explained that the right to organize labor unions - and the fact that this union has participated as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - should be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now, when these rights are under assault in America, wise, indeed, return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to ensure that their voices were heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:</seg>
<seg id="21">History is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the nation's power, but increased them.</seg>
<seg id="23">Raising the living standards of millions, unions miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to fragile level of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack the unions, forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.</seg>
<seg id="25">History remembers how should and to us.</seg>
<seg id="26">Official recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the protection of civil rights, to prevent discrimination against organizations, trade unions, was long overdue.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the U.S., a federal judge on Sunday temporarily has blocked the enactment of the law in Louisiana, which his supporters say he is likely to close all five абортных clinics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to this measure, which was signed by Governor of Louisiana Bobby Джинадлом in June and was supposed to go into effect September 1, doctors who do abortions, were obliged to have powers of patients in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nevertheless, the judge's decision means that, at present, doctors can continue to do legal abortions, while continuing to seek such powers.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally, continuing actions to gain power," he wrote in his decision, Judge John деГрэвеллз.</seg>
<seg id="6">A hearing will be scheduled within the next month, at which the judge made a more permanent solution on this law.</seg>
<seg id="7">Advocates for abortion rights welcomed this decision with joy, the last in a chain of decisions against similar measures, saying this will give doctors more time to receive hospital authority.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today's decision ensures that the women will be protected from Louisiana as one aspect of the law, which seeks to deprive them of the health and human rights," said Nancy Нортап, president and head of the Center for reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the five clinics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the decision applies to doctors from two clinics, which were not claimants in the case, and also filed a declaration on authority.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, and the courts recently acknowledged such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="11">Key parts of texas law that would have shut most of the remaining clinics in this state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fighters for the right to abortion, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association say that laws about the credentials of doctors to impose restrictions that are not necessary from the medical point of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Abortion opponents object that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, though some also noted their positive effects in the closure of clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only one doctor who does abortions in Louisiana, the receiving authority is in the hospital, according to the Center for reproductive Rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all the other doctors in the state will be forced to stop performing the procedure, the doctor, fearing for their safety, would cease to perform this procedure, the group said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they would punish doctors doing abortions as long as their statements are waiting for the decision of the authority.</seg>

<seg id="1">What will the introduction of quotas on domestic products</seg>
<seg id="2">Not less than half of products for each type of product in the range trading networks should be the Russian production, says Duma deputy from Just Russia, Oleg Nilov.</seg>
<seg id="3">The MP has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures for domestic manufacturers, writes the newspaper Izvestia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The document will still детализироваться, in order to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.</seg>
<seg id="5">This applies to goods that are produced in Russia. <... > According to the rest of the groups of products, which are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to give at least half of their shelves domestic manufacturers, "Nilov told the publication.</seg>
<seg id="6">Together with the amendments to the article "On the basis of state regulation of trading activities in the Russian Federation," the bill provides for the introduction of changes to the Tax Code, laying down a 10% rate of VAT in Norway with the implementation of the products produced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea to introduce a 50% quota -процентную in trade networks included in the stimulus package for Russian producers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The shop will appear in several times more than domestic goods.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the initiative may have both positive and negative effects, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to attorney Налоговик ", a member of the independent think-tank" Public Duma Sergei, "Litvinenko for the Russian economy, as well as for domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive in nature, and will lead to growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">The advantage will be key, farmers, small shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">They will be able to sell more, and it means that profits will grow.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms and prices, retailers because they will be forced to buy their goods.</seg>
<seg id="14">Russian manufacturers will be able to increase the volume of its sales activities and that will lead to pay higher taxes than before.</seg>
<seg id="15">This will increase budget revenues, will create new jobs, any industry begin to expand any faster осваиваться, will be introduced to contribute to the growth of GDP.</seg>
<seg id="16">Russia's dependence on foreign food down several times, though not immediately, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="17">Earlier, Russian companies are often unable to fight their way to the shelves of local stores due to higher competition from foreign counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche liberated and sigh of relief.</seg>
<seg id="19">But do not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary checks at the Russian market we get food from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="20">In other words, it is now "calm" moment when former players have already left, and the new has not yet come.</seg>
<seg id="21">Almost a month later, you can talk about modern demand for Russian raw materials, as well as rising prices for finished products, "said Vice President АиФ.ru first all-Russian social organization" Russian club financial directors, "Tamara Kasyanov.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clearly, the idea of selling in each category at least 50 per cent of Russian food products will help to consolidate the sector for local producers.</seg>
<seg id="23">In that case, they will have to compete with one another, not with products that subsidies at the expense of another state, are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="24">In other words, the fight for customers will unfold between companies, working on a single law industry.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, says Kasyanov, Russian producers are able to meet 50% of domestic needs compatriots not on all items.</seg>
<seg id="26">And in this situation commercial networks would have to "share" дотягивать Russian goods up to half of the range.</seg>
<seg id="27">In this regard, increasing fears that the store will be available substandard goods.</seg>
<seg id="28">Perhaps under the guise of produced in Russia, will be delivered to foreign products with labels перебитыми, "adds an expert.</seg>
<seg id="29">A negative effect of introducing quotas are large trading networks, especially those who cooperate with выгодней importers.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is logical that, when such a scenario will suffer and foreign suppliers, because the demand for their products will decrease.</seg>
<seg id="31">Litvinenko did not rule out that the law on quotas on domestic goods may impact on consumers.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fact is that some of the Russian-made products can yield quality imported ones, while shops will be boosting prices on the second as a scarce commodity.</seg>
<seg id="33">About the early 2000s import substitution idea economists have started talking again in February this year because of the ongoing devaluation of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="34">Now, amid the uneasy relations with the West, the question of refusal to the import of products becomes even more urgent.</seg>
<seg id="35">The law aims to compel retailers under orders to suppliers reckon with domestic producers.</seg>
<seg id="36">Then we are much faster and more confident we will go on the path of import substitution and planning system of the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter period of time, "says the MP Oleg Nilov.</seg>
<seg id="37">Especially effective mechanism be quotas for those agricultural sectors, where the potential is especially high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.</seg>
<seg id="38">Our farmers are able to fully cover the shelves in Russian shops.</seg>

<seg id="1">Inflation came out of the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="2">Whether the Russians feel the sharp increase in prices</seg>
<seg id="3">As a result of Western sanctions and the November inflation in Russia but not in forecasts and уложится authorities believe, "VTB Capital analysts."</seg>
<seg id="4">According to experts, the deferred effects антисанкций will lead to inflationary ever in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the latest forecast, the Economic Development Ministry in 2014 inflation will be 6,5-7,5% the following year - less than the 6.5 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to the newspaper Kommersant this week, "the ministry should make a" small but significant "changes in macroeconomic forecast up to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the publication, the Office may lower estimate of inflation in 2015, which will eliminate progeSOFT expected revenue growth of the population.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the forecast, it was assumed that the Russian food sanctions apply a year - until August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">In such a situation, you could assume such high inflation?</seg>
<seg id="10">The current situation involves onetime shock, but понижательный trend of inflation does not change, "the source said in the paper so far.</seg>
<seg id="11">Economists from VTB Capital "don't share expectations regarding inflation and government economic bloc forecast price growth in 2014 at the level of 8%.</seg>
<seg id="12">The main effect of product bans will come together with the possible introduction of the Spine sales tax (GAP) in 2015, experts believe.</seg>
<seg id="13">Inflationary spike in 9% in February, after which the annual pace of price growth will decline, some experts believe.</seg>
<seg id="14">Incidentally, last week, pursued by the first let inflation results, after Russia imposed a "neat sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="15">АиФ.ru interviewed experts and found them inflationary expectations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Artem Деев, head of research at FC AForex:</seg>
<seg id="17">Already there has been a rise in prices for goods.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moreover, when I began to appreciate the socially relevant products, the government was forced to launch measures to monitor systemic risks to price stability, in order to prevent unreasonable price increases in the short term.</seg>
<seg id="19">Suppliers and retailers already report on a daily basis before regulators that authorities knew exactly who was where and for what reason will trigger an increase in prices.</seg>
<seg id="20">Key factors for the growth of the consumer price index continues to be tremendous pace of capital flight, excessive refinancing the banking sector from the Russian мегарегулятора, internal convert because of the population fleeing in foreign currency, as well as an embargo on the import of food from countries that joined the sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="21">If inflationary pressures remained under control, the cost of a minimum basket of products have not jumped by 12% in a single quarter.</seg>
<seg id="22">A ban on the import of food products provoked shock proposals on the internal market and led to the utterly логичному ultimate value enhancement.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because at this stage we are not able to fully launch the mechanism, import substitution as well as increase self-sufficiency of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production, sanctions will continue to be the growth component of the inflationary risks.</seg>
<seg id="24">If you add another here and fiscal reasons related to the lack of trust in the national currency, as well as ухудшенными prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year, inflation could exceed 8%.</seg>
<seg id="25">Alexander Разуваев, director of the analytical department of Alpari. ""</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 1990s, inflation sometimes hit 20-30% per month to zero, it was also higher than current levels, another thing that then it is offset by rapid economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="27">I think, at the end of the year inflation will be 8-8,5%.</seg>
<seg id="28">Plato Магута, managing assets of the Criminal Code, "the Fund Магута"</seg>
<seg id="29">An external factor associated with sanctions against Russia, while successfully contained, but if there is a further increase of the pressure, first and foremost, for the financial sector - this can lead to certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations, which usually manifest themselves in traditionally purchases cash currency to protect their savings.</seg>
<seg id="30">It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance will try to smooth the rouble weakening, as market practices and government regulation.</seg>
<seg id="31">But prices traditionally begins after a lull over the summer, and perhaps this fall will become more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="32">The target level of consumer inflation in Russia to 7.5%, most likely, a weapon, as Russia has another dividend.</seg>

<seg id="15">"As regards the proposed settlements for the constructive elements, but in practice this is implementable, because when constructing buildings often use different technologies," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is no secret that develops стройрынок thanks largely to госзаказу.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the Chairman of the Board "expert opinion" Catherine Лезиной procurement professionals community, today the state is the most effective customer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Deputy director of the pharmaceutical industry ’ s centre of capital construction Vladimir Malakhov drew attention to the fact that the market can be divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and the company that owns outsourced competence and does not allow for this field of competitors.</seg>
<seg id="19">He believes that the creation of a transparent market is only possible when access to contracts that Turkey will maximize the impact someone's manager.</seg>
<seg id="20">The council of experts was asked to form a government system in such a way that one and the same performer may not receive more than one contract worth more than 1 billion rubles, or several contracts worth more than $1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="21">In минстрое believe that this approach must be evaluated from the point of view of the business impact, and effectiveness of management.</seg>
<seg id="22">As explained by Elena Zhukova, in this case, you will need to endow customer functions, which will lead to an increase in the number of normal customer and budgetary expenditure on its content.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the same time, the customer will need to have the knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by contractors, as well as their safety.</seg>
<seg id="24">Often this will be determined by who will be responsible for the security of an object as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of highly skilled players should be in connection with the Federal Reserve expected to receive state order for part-time work and a small amount of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="26">The deputy head of the Institute of procurement экспертно-консультационного Alexander Евсташенков believes that the procurement procedure is now in business to Scor contractor.</seg>
<seg id="27">And this example: "A participant when filling in the application must indicate" specific performance "without specifying the words" or equivalent "," should "," "," "more," "less than," "similar" "or", "type", "type", not a "lower," "lower," "higher," "can," "may," "might," "earlier" and "no earlier", not "higher," "not allowed" and so on.</seg>
<seg id="28">Thus, customers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of applications, customer organizations.</seg>
<seg id="29">Another problem, according to 44-ФЗ Евсташенкова, was the need to assess the quality of application of the proposal through a "paper" member.</seg>
<seg id="30">Looking at a proposal that actually can be assessed only a qualified contractor, but not the quality of the works, to which hadn't even started, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="31">The quality of the works can be assessed only when their acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Experts also suggested the council was to move a margin income from the top to the bottom, disappeared to intermediate contractors.</seg>
<seg id="33">Chairman of the Board, and espionage expert at FAS Andrew Цариковский believes that it is not worth it, as responsible for the order should генподрядчик.</seg>
<seg id="34">But otherwise, as in the famous репризе Arkady Raikin normalises sleeping: "Пуговицам claims to have?"</seg>

<seg id="2">In the former home of gold and горнозаводчиков Евдокима and his son Ivan Демидова on the street of the October Revolution, 57 / 1 (former Big Kazan) 18 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 18th century since the house was virtually unchanged, if not considered ветхость.</seg>
<seg id="4">People are strangers here, both on tour, and residents are more than delighted, from his privilege - the right to live in the house, the walls of which Ufa старейшем remember commander Alexander Suvorov.</seg>
<seg id="5">Date buildings house amongst others, historians point to the two dates - 1730 and 1737 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in any case, it turns out that the nearly 300 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The old yard, always open the door, squeaky staircase.</seg>
<seg id="8">Doors in the apartments are located near each other, the walls, the chair covers were cracked and peeling plaster просветы places visible from the street.</seg>
<seg id="9">Everything seems to be the honest word.</seg>
<seg id="10">But local residents are told: "You don't think it is."</seg>
<seg id="11">Live in a wooden house in the 18th century is very difficult, "says Tatiana (1961, a resident of apartment # 3.</seg>
<seg id="12">The object is on госохране, but its content has not allocated the money for dozens of years, and we feel museum exhibits, about whom the authorities simply forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">The last renovation was 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The wall even though with great difficulties, but the foundation of the entire прогнил.</seg>
<seg id="15">Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, but comes out from shower once a week in a public bath.</seg>
<seg id="16">How can we be satisfied in such conditions?</seg>
<seg id="17">The road passes directly under the windows, even a pedestrian zone.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tatiana dented curtain.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now see what before was only heard: Under the windows of the cars stream rushes.</seg>
<seg id="20">You see, glass дребезжат constantly, can't open a window, and got used to the noise.</seg>
<seg id="21">The same person the whole gets used to the good and the bad.</seg>
<seg id="22">Our apartment is still a top, thanks to her husband, he has golden hands.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, we have two rooms, three of them live with her son.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for other families, the conditions are much worse, even ceilings on the second floor of a little more than one and a half metres tall.</seg>
<seg id="25">In contrast to Tatiana offers guests the roommate out of the apartment No. 6 Lyudmila Старостиной.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nice friendly woman with threshold offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile said:</seg>
<seg id="27">We have a one-bedroom apartment, 14.5 m ² for four people, and we live with her husband and daughter with his granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="28">I've been here from the birth of another boundary, has never been seen before, "Lyudmila обводит eyes room: Sofa Measures, two of the letter" g "; one of them was the granddaughter with a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="29">Very closely and differs little from a domestic interior: Only beautiful ceilings, "historical."</seg>
<seg id="30">But with the ceiling regularly flows: Tap system worn.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lyudmila said about his apartment and amazing at the same time, simply as trends, which is home to Roman ruins.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is one very old and brings in a recent, everyday and legendary:</seg>
<seg id="33">Water spent about 40 years ago during the last repair.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the same time we had a tiny kitchen and bathroom in закутке from former чулана.</seg>
<seg id="35">We live in a time where квартировал Demidov, the family lived on the second floor of a servant.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our apartment didn't privatized, and why?</seg>
<seg id="37">In Ufa, privatization say property values is not.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still only get cozy apartment, can't apply for more.</seg>
<seg id="39">Already four months ago, we promised to provide further promises, but it didn't matter.</seg>
<seg id="40">Not used to complain and I will not.</seg>
<seg id="41">In this apartment (room!) lived for an entire dynasty: My grandparents, mum and dad, I'm with my husband and my daughter with his granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="42">Things happened during that time.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, здоровенные rats ran in the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="44">Look at the walls, they one-meter wide thickness.</seg>
<seg id="45">They say the solution was involved in eggs, so long rests.</seg>
<seg id="46">House built thoroughly Демидовым, thank you!</seg>
<seg id="47">Perhaps, just so no one killed or сваей обрушившимся ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="48">Only building still slowly dying there in his eyes: The board and a log house, гниют floors have repeatedly failed, we pouring cement, but all the useless - solution goes into the ground, as well.</seg>
<seg id="49">They say it is "under our room the лаз and move to the river White, who had once lived here, the old believers to hide from danger, in which case.</seg>
<seg id="50">Persecuted them.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lyudmila Starostina said to him came as a historian, he begged to be let into the apartment, he began excavations.</seg>
<seg id="52">And then urged to give them housing space in exchange for its однушку in October.</seg>
<seg id="53">Lyudmila historian refused:</seg>
<seg id="54">Where are we in вчетвером однушку?</seg>
<seg id="55">But there is at least a tiny hope that will give housing more spacious.</seg>
<seg id="56">The second exchange, we would not have won.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, the family Старостиных nothing won.</seg>
<seg id="58">The biggest dream, Ludmila расселили, and daughter gave his granddaughter of one 16-year-old from a separate room.</seg>
<seg id="59">Then there are the two families have identified two-room apartment instead of the majestic ruins, in which two generations living now.</seg>
<seg id="60">Pretty girl, миниатюрная Olesya Карсакова apartments from No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.</seg>
<seg id="61">There in two cramped squeezed into airless apartments with a total area of 23 m ², called apartments, lives with her large family.</seg>
<seg id="62">We just seven people, two children.</seg>
<seg id="63">See for yourself what kind of conditions.</seg>
<seg id="64">Butt falls off pieces of plaster and window frames, the walls in the kitchen and to include cross-cutting holes.</seg>
<seg id="65">The water in the кране only cold all year round.</seg>
<seg id="66">Walking about the apartments in the old house, so you can make sure that the most fortunate of spouses Лаврентьевым apartment No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="67">They occupy the most spacious rooms of the first floor.</seg>
<seg id="68">You are right, a lot of places.</seg>
<seg id="69">In the area of 75 square, directed three man.</seg>
<seg id="70">We live just in those rooms, where legend has it stopped the police during his stay in Ufa, "says Alexander Lavrentyev, the head of the family.</seg>
<seg id="71">High ceilings, spacious.</seg>
<seg id="72">One bad - all around the train wreck that is collapsing, falling apart.</seg>
<seg id="73">Neighbors probably already told.</seg>
<seg id="74">Most suffering we have with floors, wooden planks, сгнили land literally went out of the legs.</seg>
<seg id="75">I put подпорки, wedges; in the hall still nothing, while in another room, as we walk on a seesaw качаемся, so all was not cemented.</seg>
<seg id="76">About house merchant Евдокима Демидова Aleksandr Dmitrievich can tell you better than any guide.</seg>
<seg id="77">To золотопромышленнику refers to the native, speaks of it with admiration.</seg>
<seg id="78">Indeed, the personality was fantastic: The owner and Кагинского Узянского plants built houses, отливал guns and bells, kept woman mines.</seg>
<seg id="79">Property heirs купеческой forefathers proud, but live under one roof with history no longer want.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am settled here, even as a child, in the 1940s, the 20th century, "says Alexander.</seg>
<seg id="81">Then around stood wooden premises for / stables and, subsequently, снесенные sentry boxes.</seg>
<seg id="82">In 1968, wanted to remove, and our home, but something prevented.</seg>
<seg id="83">The same story was repeated again in 2014: Поманили new housing.</seg>
<seg id="84">We, as a team, gathered all the necessary court documents обегали, and suddenly learned that moving to an apartment in 2015 or 2016.</seg>
<seg id="85">Something already doesn't believe in all this.</seg>
<seg id="86">Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan, to learn the fate of homes.</seg>
<seg id="87">Officials of the occupier was not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="88">Sent from one desk to another, but then, as mockery, given on paper without the signature and seal: "The Ministry of Culture is not objecting to the resettlement of tenants."</seg>
<seg id="89">Even I have a feeling that our house has been there for a long time in terms of the city, because he was under the number 57, then became 57 A, now 57 / 1.</seg>
<seg id="90">As if he had already been demolished in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="91">"A planet" urged the head of analytical work on the land management sector resources Ufa Vladimir Барабашу.</seg>
<seg id="92">A house on the street of the October Revolution, 57 / 1 is included in the resettlement programme dilapidated housing.</seg>
<seg id="93">I can't be responsible for the actions of officials in the 70s, only know that at the time there was a plan for demolition of old homes, despite the historical significance.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the authorities - to restore all the old houses down the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value, is successfully implemented.</seg>
<seg id="95">Residents soon is expected to provide new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="96">According to Барабаша, restore House Демидова are Italian specialists who took part in the restoration of buildings in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="97">Now in Italy passes architectural Biennale project, and "Old Ufa" presented there, among others.</seg>
<seg id="98">I hope that by 2016 all former Old Street will be on best Western Hotel Tigra was renovated, "said the official.</seg>
<seg id="99">Home will look like a proper, who was earlier, three centuries ago.</seg>
<seg id="100">House Демидова, is likely to become a museum, open to all comers.</seg>
<seg id="101">In addition, at ministerial level the decision over the weekend to make streets pedestrian.</seg>
<seg id="102">On weekdays, unfortunately, don't get too big, the workload of roads in the city.</seg>
<seg id="103">People from the future museum provide Vladimir Barabas promises in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="104">However, it is unlikely that they will be: Their new apartments will be of the same area that current.</seg>

<seg id="2">Never say, "I love you"</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was one of seven children born to a family of immigrants from Jamaica in Dudley in is in 1958.</seg>
<seg id="4">His father, who died when Henry was 19, he worked in a factory, and their relationship has been limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry репетирует comedy, "Редкие records Rudi," which is partially based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of programmes on Radio 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mix of рэгги and rap, and melodies - жизнерадостны.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, Henry had to get through some difficult memories of childhood.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the death of his mother was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often mused about the relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was very inaccessible.</seg>
<seg id="10">You never saw his face, you only hear his voice: "Don't make noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">The отстань sisters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Шевелись!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch the cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers Seymour and Hilton that were older, when I was a kid, walked with him in the pub and talk about such things as a form of beer glasses, the beauty of the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">I have never talked with him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was so неулыбчивым guy in the corner, reading a newspaper which is a big part of my life.</seg>
<seg id="17">Henry recently opened the studio are in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in the days of his father, he was able to look at what must have been his life.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now there's a little bit better, but it's dark, дымные labyrinths' full extent, depth of Tartary with outbreaks of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father залезал in a bathtub and just lay there, and you have heard, as he slowly begins to sing to myself, because he wanted the отмыться broadcasting studio.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I came back, I realised that he was doing it years and years to make us, as ever, and I began to appreciate it more.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nevertheless, Henry came from a childhood devoid of parental love.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."</seg>
<seg id="23">It was only when her mother became ill at the end of her life, we started to talk: "I love you, I love you, I love you.</seg>
<seg id="24">The birth of her own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love with which he lacked as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">You can stop it, "I love you"?</seg>
<seg id="26">Just don't hug me!</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I'm 22!</seg>
<seg id="28">With Don French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why would I not be friends with her?</seg>
<seg id="30">She's a great mother</seg>
<seg id="31">They are still great friends with the French, to whom he was married for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="32">Don is a good man.</seg>

<seg id="35">Henry was the mother's diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="36">He was one of what killed her.</seg>
<seg id="37">So, when I was very, very recovered and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take drastic measures.</seg>
<seg id="38">Then I began serious training фитенсом, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It's very hard.</seg>
<seg id="40">And that's boring.</seg>
<seg id="41">Nobody eats carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">A change of career trajectories of Henry reflected, perhaps in his noble, briefly подстриженной бороде.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he received the recognition of critics for his Othello, he completely immersed in theatre.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Mistakes" Комедия followed, and then "guest" Огаста Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">This work is different from sitcoms and comedies that were неотъемлимым attribute his busy professional life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He started his career, when he was 16 and worked in a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">Deejay remarked as he parodies on the stage, and wrote about it in "The new faces."</seg>
<seg id="48">His career in television began in the mid seventies: "Quite a long time I was the only black пародистом / first on television."</seg>
<seg id="49">He learned on the job.</seg>
<seg id="50">I not only had to grow up in front of the public, I had to learn how to be an effective vehicle for delivering jokes between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working on television, and it was very hard.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny in the 'New faces "in 1975</seg>
<seg id="52">As his manager had the right to "Black and white minstrels" show, light entertainment program, in which people "чернили themselves face," Henry found that stands in it for five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">My family is a very disliked.</seg>
<seg id="54">I, like, hopefully, this will never be with me, but I don't regret doing it.</seg>
<seg id="55">Although it was strange, worthy of condemnation position, I worked for large venues and learned to work the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="56">But what was "which received awards light entertainment on British television classics for years and years," and was "grotesque, to black people."</seg>
<seg id="57">Introducing characters who were black culture in the UK, and her perfume, Henry worked in alternative комедийном project in the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="58">The first season of "Show Lenny Henry" was broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as, among other things, the chef Гэрет Блэклок from the comedy series "Biased!."</seg>
<seg id="59">Commercials, documentaries, television series and roles in films took the following ten years of his life, but after his show on BBC in 2008 "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "what are you going to do next, Len, because it seems to me that you're тянешь time or quietly сворачиваешь aside."</seg>
<seg id="60">Next was a series of documentary broadcasts on Radio 4 called "What's good for...?"</seg>
<seg id="61">The first was about Шекспире.</seg>
<seg id="62">I was a genuine allergy to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">That is not to say that I've taught this at school, and I thought that it was, in many ways, the prerogative of white people with middle-class колготками and cabbage at the bottom of the front.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I am very afraid of him.</seg>
<seg id="65">Everything, from whom we took an interview for transmission, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Денч said: "You need to try.</seg>
<seg id="66">Not ругай it as long as you don't know what you are talking about.</seg>
<seg id="67">Произнеси aloud some of these words, and you will understand why we are all so love Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry read 20 rows from a monologue by a recent documentary for Othello, and his зацепило.</seg>
<seg id="69">I had the feeling that I can do it.</seg>
<seg id="70">Like my head выправили.</seg>
<seg id="71">"That's what it is, this is a serious case, Treat seriously, your appliances, a small study of the original text.</seg>
<seg id="72">So, the process of rehearsals was tough, and I read this play for months and months before we put it.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">It seemed that they were waiting for a disaster, but it has not happened.</seg>
<seg id="75">Soon we began "Комедию mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I was at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you have changed."</seg>
<seg id="78">The technical problem arose, and Henry felt instinctively that his job is to entertain the public.</seg>
<seg id="79">"Pacific voice inside me said: 'You have to work 10 minutes until they чинят computer". "</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead, assistant director announced that view will resume as soon as the problem will be solved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I walked away from the scene and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."</seg>
<seg id="82">It's not my responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can't let someone else deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="84">"You're playing in, stay in the role of". "</seg>
<seg id="85">In "Henry in the theater Дачесс заборах"</seg>
<seg id="86">Learn the text for "Заборов" was difficult.</seg>
<seg id="87">Panic is quite useful, she strengthens muscle.</seg>

<seg id="90">So I держусь this.</seg>
<seg id="91">I really love it.</seg>
<seg id="92">I love being in the репетиционном hall.</seg>
<seg id="93">By the way, Henry is still thinking comedian - all the way our conversation перебивают flashes his humor, when he starts something, he finishes to parody.</seg>
<seg id="94">I just decided not to work in стендапе, because this thing with instant gratification from a room full of strangers, I think, quite dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="95">If you want to do all the time, this can lead to a standstill.</seg>
<seg id="96">I sometimes work in "Прямом broadcast in Apollo, when I want, but, in the main, I don't get so much pleasure as before.</seg>
<seg id="97">I ask whether he will tour стендапа ever again.</seg>
<seg id="98">The joy of sitting in a room with the director, who helps shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think that will ever willingly withdraw from it.</seg>
<seg id="99">This is his new incarnation?</seg>
<seg id="100">I think so.</seg>
<seg id="101">I like to be an actor.</seg>
<seg id="102">It's pretty fun.</seg>

<seg id="2">They растворялись best say exactly as they gradually разваливались as cardboard box, which was left in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="3">But sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, hard, tough, and maybe a little раздражительный.</seg>
<seg id="4">And then she пожимала his hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">He saw in his irritability.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was, as колючим hair, yes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The latest victim of this колючести was little novel, from which he waited longer than usual, deliverance from lonely and boring life, and perhaps even some satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Эйлинн Соломонз was pulsating with взлохмаченными fragile beautiful hair and трепещущим heart from northern island village, an even more remote and harsh than Port Ройбен.</seg>
<seg id="9">She came to the south with спутницей older than himself, whom Кеверн believed her aunt, while the latter has inherited a house in crude, but similar to the joyous paradise under the name "Райская Valley."</seg>
<seg id="10">No one lived in the house for several years.</seg>
<seg id="11">The pipes were trickling in bathtub sat motionless, spiders, слизни left their footprints on all the windows, confident in the fact that the house belongs to them; garden зарос weeds, like giant кочаны cabbage.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was like a cottage from children ’ s books, simultaneously frightening and enchanting, with a garden full of secrets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Opinion of the author: Howard Джейкобсон, whose novel "J" is included in the лонг-лист Букеровской Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">The shortlist will be announced next week</seg>
<seg id="15">And Кеверн Эйлинн sat, holding hands, broken the sun loungers in the high grass, enjoying surprisingly warm spring day; they both "connected to your console, which provided cheap country music and appeasing 3-zmianowy news, when, glancing at her brown legs crossed, he remembered the old song long forgotten black performer that he loved listening to his father, curtains down in the house.</seg>
<seg id="16">You got big feet too.</seg>
<seg id="17">In view of the inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type on the console is no longer lost.</seg>
<seg id="18">They were not banned - nothing in fact was not prohibited them - just no longer lost.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have become архаичными, as the word "archaic."</seg>
<seg id="20">Public taste did what would have never managed to achieve orders and regulations, and in the same way that people choose among books of memoirs rich, staying in poverty, cookbooks and love the novels, of all the music they chose ballads.</seg>
<seg id="21">This afternoon, my cardinal Кеверн began playing the piano ideation and rough comic voice praise great legs Эйлинн.</seg>
<seg id="22">Эйлинн not understood.</seg>
<seg id="23">"This was a popular if jazz pianist named Фэтс Уоллер", he told her, automatically placing two fingers to his lips.</seg>
<seg id="24">So did his father to stop the letter "J" before she fall from power immediately from his lips.</seg>
<seg id="25">It started with the game, in which they played when he was little.</seg>
<seg id="26">His father played in it with his father, as he told him.</seg>
<seg id="27">Start with "J" word, forgetting put two fingers to his mouth, "and it will cost you a penny.</seg>
<seg id="28">It was not a very fun game then, and it was not very fun right now.</seg>
<seg id="29">He knew that from him for this, that's all.</seg>
<seg id="30">He had to explain what is jazz.</seg>
<seg id="31">Эйлинн never heard.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jazz is also played, although he was not explicitly prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="33">Improvisation went out of fashion.</seg>
<seg id="34">There was only one place in my life "if."</seg>
<seg id="35">When the music started, people wanted to know exactly where it will end.</seg>
<seg id="36">With wit in exactly the same way.</seg>
<seg id="37">His unpredictability had acted on people's nerves.</seg>
<seg id="38">But jazz was wit, marked with the help of music.</seg>
<seg id="39">Although he has reached the age of 10 years, never слышав about Sammy Дэвисе Младшем, Кеверн knew about jazz from paternal полусекретной коллеции CDs.</seg>
<seg id="40">But at least he did not have to speak Эйлинн that Фэтс Уоллер was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">Given her age, it is unlikely that she remembered a time when popular singers were not black.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again, there are no laws or pressure.</seg>
<seg id="43">Society was docile, and this meant that each segment it agreed with gratitude - the gratitude of those spared destiny, "with the principle of group predispositions.</seg>
<seg id="44">People афро-карибского origin on temperament and physical characteristics suitable for the good of sport and entertainment, and they sang and ran.</seg>
<seg id="45">With Индостана natives, as if by nature talented in everything that concerned the electronics, so that no family is left without a working phone number online.</seg>
<seg id="46">What is left of the Polish diaspora, the effectiveness of internal work; what is left of the Greek plate, the price.</seg>
<seg id="47">Natives from the Persian Gulf, and whose grandfathers did not have to leave the country, when that happened, IF NOT THAT ВООБЩЕ happened happened, in fear that accused them of inciting flame, in fear, in fact, that the flame will absorb them, with the restaurants and not get лабне, staring and yearned from leisure.</seg>
<seg id="48">Each according to his abilities.</seg>
<seg id="49">As she had heard only ballads Эйлинн was hard to understand how offensive words, who had just sung her Кеверн, could be set to music.</seg>
<seg id="50">Music is an expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">"They are not really offensive," said Кеверн.</seg>
<seg id="52">Except, maybe, for people who have great legs.</seg>
<seg id="53">My father never offended no one, but he loved this song.</seg>
<seg id="54">He said too much, but launched a garden gave him the illusion of security.</seg>
<seg id="55">No word could not penetrate the US giant leaves similar to капустные.</seg>
<seg id="56">Эйлинн still did not understand.</seg>
<seg id="57">Like your father could love this?</seg>
<seg id="58">He wanted to say that it was a joke, but he did not want to again if it eases up two fingers to his lips.</seg>
<seg id="59">And so she had thought he was strange.</seg>
<seg id="60">"To him it seemed funny," he said instead.</seg>
<seg id="61">She shook her head, Кеверну недоверчиво close review.</seg>
<seg id="62">The whole world was nothing but her копны иссиня-черных hair.</seg>
<seg id="63">Nothing, that he would like to watch.</seg>
<seg id="64">"Well, if you say so," she said, in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="65">But this still does not explain why you sing it to me.</seg>
<seg id="66">She seemed really upset.</seg>
<seg id="67">I have too big feet?</seg>
<seg id="68">He looked at them again.</seg>
<seg id="69">You cannot say no.</seg>
<seg id="70">Ankles, maybe a little bit.</seg>
<seg id="71">And you say you hate me, because my ankles are too thick?</seg>
<seg id="72">I hate you?</seg>
<seg id="73">Of course, I don't hate you.</seg>
<seg id="74">It's just this stupid song.</seg>
<seg id="75">He could say: "I love you," but it was too early.</seg>
<seg id="76">"I like you very much because you have thick ankles", tried to say he instead.</seg>
<seg id="77">I have such a perversion.</seg>
<seg id="78">It was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="79">He wanted it was ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="80">Attempts by the joke often made him awkward situation, because, like his father, he was missing the soothing charm that could mitigate the cruelty, the крывшуюся шутках.</seg>
<seg id="81">Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.</seg>
<seg id="82">Maybe he, Кеверн, wanted.</seg>
<seg id="83">Despite the good eye.</seg>
<seg id="84">Эйлинн Соломонз she blushed and stood up with the console and Strait опрокинув wine that they drank.</seg>

<seg id="86">In her excitement she seemed lighter as пальмовые leaves in the weather system.</seg>
<seg id="87">"And you, I like you very much because you have a head amounts to pointless," she said.</seg>
<seg id="88">Although not like you very much.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was sorry her and because of the excessive brutality of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she gave him the state.</seg>
<seg id="90">She thought that he hit her?</seg>
<seg id="91">She has not talked to him about life on the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that, in basic terms, it was like a здешнюю.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same huge icy ocean struck on both of them.</seg>
<seg id="93">The same used to be men, even more sensitive and capricious after IS THAT happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened than their ancestors, the smugglers and разрушители, shopped in fury from pub to pub, ready to raise a hand on any woman, or to deny them посмевшую поддразнить them.</seg>
<seg id="94">Amounts to pointless head?</seg>
<seg id="95">They would have shown her a fist, if she wasn't careful.</seg>
<seg id="96">Would be first kissed, kiss now became the most common erotic expression of irritation between a man and a woman; an antidote from fresh ballads, which Google is the first console to kiss her, and then hit.</seg>
<seg id="97">Excessive clarification, according to Кеверна because the kiss itself was already DVD films.</seg>
<seg id="98">Эйлинн Соломонз case showed that he needs to leave.</seg>
<seg id="99">He rose from шезлонга, as an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She felt herself a lead weight, but the weight of his grief surprised her.</seg>
<seg id="101">This was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They barely knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">She watched as he goes, and out of an upper window, watching as he goes, her companion, a man, himself at взваливший themselves.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam, the outgoing garden, she thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">She felt a stab of sympathy towards him and men in general, even though some of them and raised her hand.</seg>
<seg id="106">The man, from the pulpit, with отвернувшийся back пристыженный ’, the ability to fight left him - why she felt she knew so well, if she could not recall a single case, until today, when she saw this?</seg>
<seg id="107">Again one Эйлинн Соломонз looked at their feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">For twenty years before the events described above or so Эсме Нуссбаум, an intelligent and energetic 32-летняя исследовательница who worked in "Офнау" unofficial service of the Community control mood, has prepared a report on the low and medium levels of violence in those parts of the country, where it was expected that it will be reduced, if not over entirely, given the money and power, which have been allocated to its eradication.</seg>
<seg id="109">"A lot has been done, and a lot is being done," she wrote, "in order to mitigate the innate aggressiveness of people who fought in wars and won most of them, especially among these спутанных branches and narrow расселин terrain where, despite hovering over изгородями church spires, gentle breathing human kindness was rarely in history.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, some quality, it turns out, неискоренимы.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher the spire, it would seem, the низменнее those passions that he зарождает.</seg>
<seg id="112">People shed tears over the sentimental stories about drinking, skipping преодоленных obstacles and announces its overheated belief in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness retains its strong grip as in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is evidence that a new depth and an angry задиристость in homes, in the workplace, on roads and even in playgrounds.</seg>
<seg id="113">"You have a habit of payments to write too much," said her adviser, having read the report as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="114">It seems to me that you should read shorter novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">Эсме Нуссбаум lowered her head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask you: You атеистка?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I think that is not obliged to answer," replied Эсме Нуссбаум.</seg>
<seg id="118">You lesbian?</seg>
<seg id="119">Эсме again insisted on his right to privacy and silence.</seg>
<seg id="120">A feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Silence again.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I ask," said Luther Рабиновиц finally, "not because I am against atheism, лесбийства or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">Here we have no prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="124">We are the servants of society without prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="125">But some kinds of hypersensitivity, absolutely reasonable and a good in themselves, they may sometimes distort the results, such as those that you have shown me.</seg>
<seg id="126">It is obvious that you yourself предубеждены against the church, and what you call "malevolent" and "rude", others would be interpreted as an expression of natural and healthy intensity.</seg>
<seg id="127">Continue нудеть about THAT happened, IF ANY ВООБЩЕ happened, as if it had happened, if at all, has happened yesterday, it means depriving the country needed her life force.</seg>
<seg id="128">Эсме Нуссбаум огляделась on parties until Рабиновиц said.</seg>
<seg id="129">Over his head, like a pink comfort letters led repeated advice that "Офнау" gave the country the last quarter of a century or more.</seg>
<seg id="130">His neighbour, улыбайся value of his spouse, listen to ballads, walk, talk on the phone, organise, talk, listen, this fairytale city, соглашайся извиняйся.</seg>
<seg id="131">The conversation is better than silence, word of the song better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I fully understand that you want to say," answered quietly Эсме Нуссбаум when satisfied that her adviser had finished talking, "and I don't want to say nothing, except that he was not as effective as we convince ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">What worries me is that if we are not prepared, we find that repeat mistakes, which initially led to ТОМУ THAT IF ВООБЩЕ happened, happened.</seg>
<seg id="134">Only this time, throwing their anger and distrust the other.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Рабиновиц joined the tips of his fingers in a sitting.</seg>
<seg id="136">This gesture was supposed to mean an infinite patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"You go too far," he said, "calling" mistakes "actions that made or not made our grandfathers.</seg>
<seg id="138">You go too far and when talking about what they threw away their "anger" and "mistrust" in the "other."</seg>
<seg id="139">In your place, people should not need since then about the fact that, in the past, but it is currently defending, we don't talk about "us" and "them."</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "us" and no "other."</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of turmoil - that's all that we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"For which, to be honest with ourselves," ventured insert Эсме, "neither part of society may well justify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am not accusing anyone.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it's bad or good, what is done is done.</seg>
<seg id="145">Then it was back then.</seg>
<seg id="146">You don't need to say anything more - here we agree.</seg>
<seg id="147">And as one should not blame anyone but don't make excuses, and, if that was appropriate, or if it might have been something to fix.</seg>
<seg id="148">But why past, if not to learn "</seg>
<seg id="149">Past Update to ensure that we have forgotten him.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I can add to that one word -</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther Рабиновица pyramid collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I'll review your report," he said, and dismissed her.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, on the way to work, a biker who rode her knocked on the sidewalk, passersby, described as "a vicious rage."</seg>

<seg id="3">The business index (PMI) for the eurozone manufacturing sector is not happy about high superstar incomes fell to 50.7 in August, dropping from July 20-25.</seg>
<seg id="4">The value of above 50 indicates growth.</seg>

<seg id="6">The values were received before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Markets will wait for a clear plan of how to cope with stopping the eurozone recovery, as well as the threat of deflation, with inflation of just 0.3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi later this week may give further signals that he is contemplating scheme of quantitative easing in the eurozone, similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Although some growth is better than no growth, braking effect of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers becomes more obvious," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at happy about high superstar incomes.</seg>
<seg id="10">The manufacturing sector PMI in Germany, a major trade partner of Russia in the EU, has fallen to the lowest level for 11 months of 51.4.</seg>

<seg id="16">Howard Арчер, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that can be said about the August survey index of business activity in the eurozone manufacturing sector is that it shows that the sector is still growing."</seg>
<seg id="17">He added: "Eurozone manufacturers, obviously, are finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension - particularly associated with the Russia / Ukraine - adds uncertainty still difficult conditions in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">This increasing tension, apparently hit by business - and especially on the confidence of consumers, and is likely to lead to the fact that some orders are delayed, or even cancelled, especially large orders.</seg>

<seg id="55">We would never say that they killed or dead.</seg>
<seg id="56">We say that they stayed in the gym.</seg>
<seg id="57">I remember my trip to London so well, especially in a toy shop, where I was allowed to choose whatever I wanted, and travel in a car with an open top.</seg>
<seg id="58">But now he is afraid for such places as Ukraine, where war leads to such grief, which he survived and his friends.</seg>
<seg id="59">This horror comes back to you every day, but I would love it if I could stop remembering him</seg>

<seg id="68">She was grateful to "Sheri Blair and its fund for the award and the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="69">I would like to call Sheri and just say to herself, that 10 years have passed, but I still remember a meeting with her and her husband in London and how they helped Дамиру and me.</seg>

<seg id="74">She said: "I still think that this world was no better over these 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="75">Today in Ukraine a war, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children were killed and would be killed.</seg>
<seg id="76">It's just the same as our children.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think for many people, war is a news broadcast, that they listen to when they get bored or when they're busy with something else.</seg>
<seg id="78">I just know that these people feel, the horror of it.</seg>
<seg id="79">And I can't stop feeling it.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.</seg>
<seg id="81">Damir grew up and became very soft and quiet boy, he's quite aggressive and angry.</seg>
<seg id="82">He does not seek revenge, for example, he did not just fixed on it in this last nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not like to remember it, but they are very close with six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and burn candles there.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember that as he lay on the couch, and away from us for hours on end.</seg>
<seg id="85">Did not sleep, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I also remember how he threw all of his weapons and other military toys. Дамиру 17 now, he's taller than me, nice, smart and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">To me it is hard to believe that a few hours I was so sure that he is dead and that I never see more.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I was able to recover from the explosion and rose to his feet, I огляделась hell, I saw around me, when parts of bodies were lying everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely sure that it is not possible to my little boy could survive in this hell.</seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember that I cried to him:" Damir, Run, "убегай, but again I was so sure that he had not heard me.</seg>
<seg id="91">But he heard, and ran off.</seg>
<seg id="92">So life goes on for us, unlike so many others.</seg>

<seg id="110">George doesn't like to look at this picture, and she was buried in a book closet at home.</seg>
<seg id="111">I understand, but I also think that the photos of people from all around the world feel our pain.</seg>
<seg id="112">George says now: "It is important that this never happened.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I doubt that we ever learn the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">People continue to investigate this tragedy and will never learn the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">Now they investigate this collapse of the Boeings in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Whether we will ever know what it was called?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world is going to something very bad.</seg>
<seg id="118">"I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, and nobody wants a war, because it is happening?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing for this pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need to have a little bit of tens of years to forget it.</seg>

<seg id="162">She's in my soul, and worse, when the anniversary is approaching.</seg>
<seg id="163">I'll go and will attend the ceremonies, which will be held, to celebrate her.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know that George did not go.</seg>
<seg id="165">For him it should be even stronger, because he was there, but I'm not.</seg>
<seg id="166">I was waiting for him at home and could not help.</seg>
<seg id="167">I am so grateful to God that he came back to me. Here in Beslan imprint lies on each.</seg>

<seg id="170">It's hard to take when something so terribly unfair, happens to you.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was a boy, he loves sports, but I can't do this because of the knee.</seg>
<seg id="172">He had several operations, he can walk, but cannot exercise.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say that the 50 per cent he overcame this nightmare, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.</seg>

<seg id="178">I know the family, where the children were born, but I know and widows who never were married.</seg>

<seg id="183">Why are they killing each other?</seg>
<seg id="184">The war is very close to our country right now, and I can hardly believe it.</seg>
<seg id="185">We were a close-knit country in the past, how did it come about that we are fighting now?</seg>
<seg id="186">Men and children are suffering, I'm sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine, and many will be killed.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips, how to achieve a better quality of underwater photos and videos</seg>
<seg id="2">If you want to take photos or shoot video under water in front of you a whole range of options.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is waterproof "мыльница", for example, the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or, for example, GoPro mounts экшн-камера Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which sold for about $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I took these pictures on a family holiday with the help of several cameras, all for the price of about $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">No matter what equipment you are using, you need to comply with several regulations, in order to achieve the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Перепроверяйте their equipment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera case and other departments closed tightly.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, set up their camera for the type of photos or videos that you shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some of the photos and video cameras filming or object type is regimes that exposure to optimise mages underwater conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in the water, notice how deeply your equipment can fall.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are aimed only at 5 feet, others - 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Look at our leadership and the ratings of digital cameras for both traditional and catalog models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Remove a few frames - because many of them don't enclosures.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" The H3 is the LCD, which lets you assign images, whereas the экшн-камер them usually don't.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have LCD, it will be difficult to see under the water, and the frame is a random process.</seg>
<seg id="16">So do a few frames.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also, if your camera is serial shooting mode, which takes several shots with slightly different plant exposure, use them.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay near the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">Significantly reduces the amount of light, the deeper you нырнете under water.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, stay at the surface, when you're shooting in a swimming pool, a river or ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">It also allows you to transmit more colors in the photos; the deeper you get, the less you see color.</seg>
<seg id="22">Подплывайте closer to filming locations.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is excellent advice for shooting on the land, but it's even more important under the water because of the mages lighting conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">Especially important if you're shooting on экшн-камеру: This equipment often comes with a fixed, широкоугольной lens, which means that you have to get closer to the objects of filming, if you want to fill the frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was such a man, whose force of personality could shake things around, even in such a giant organization like the National Health Service.</seg>
<seg id="2">Консультирующий anaesthetist, he has devoted his career as deliverance from patients suffering from illness and reducing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among those who spoke to him, recalls his wife, MI-6 officer was who had to live with devastating effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that as long as Dr. passionate about being diagnosed and diseases, those being treated mostly worried about something else -- the pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, however, he appeared to those who suffer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I never felt, as usual," he wrote in May last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I found it difficult to find in themselves the strength.</seg>
<seg id="8">Struggling with symptoms similar to flu, he found that his wife, Джулиет reproaches irritably.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want all happened sooner rather than later," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Джулиет went on for a week, Lawson found that unusual and it is not clear why he was upset.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked a colleague to chest X-rays.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks before he went skiing in the Alps, surgical.</seg>
<seg id="14">Results of the X-rays came.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was mesothelioma, a terminal cancer, which affects плевру shell, or lungs.</seg>
<seg id="16">For most cancers, it is difficult to determine an exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although some people succumb to cancer of the lung, for example, not all patients develop lung cancer smoked.</seg>
<seg id="18">But with attributable to mesothelioma differently.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, grainy construction material, who once called the "miracle," but which, as we now know, deadly dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us is disease mesothelioma, which you could not pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos, in the end, is the stuff from the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in the UK since the 1960s, when these industrial ban came into force.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even when it has been used, only people from specific sectors worked in close contact with him: Трубоизолировщики, builders, carpenters and artists, such as computers.</seg>
<seg id="24">Industrial toxin from another era, he hardly seems cause for concern today.</seg>
<seg id="25">But such a calm erroneously.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it turns out, is now at the peak of the epidemic мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="27">Here мезотелиомы dies from more people than in any other country on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="28">The annual death rate at about 2500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease than as a result of road accidents.</seg>
<seg id="29">The annual number of deaths from мезотелиомы since 1980 and projected the number of deaths in the UK in the future</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason we feel its deadly consequences right now, lies in the fact that, although the use of asbestos and it is illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), for the development of мезотелиомы go usually tens of years.</seg>
<seg id="31">And attack мезотелиомы veterans specialties is not limited to industrial construction.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was, and is, in many cases, remains in the house where we live, where we work, offices, schools, where we learn, and shops, where we go shopping.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention in class, the level of prosperity, profession or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">Bastions of избранности from fashion, London department stores to private schools, as it turned out, not salvation.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parliament building is riddled with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even hospitals that are meant to cure us of deadly reservoirs have proved to be a carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was not трубоизолировщиком.</seg>
<seg id="39">Strictly speaking, he had to think where he might have come into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he realized.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It seems that there might be a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital where I spent six years on it," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">All are students, nurses, doctors and грузчики - used these тоннелями.</seg>
<seg id="43">I wonder how many of my peers expect the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">It was a question, to which, unfortunately, he was able to give a partial response.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Of the four doctors who in Guy's Hospital and have subsequently developed mesothelioma for the past five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I alone remained alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us expect this disease?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Лоусону was diagnosed with mesothelioma, "" when he was 48 years old.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">Live so long is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty percent attributable to mesothelioma patients die within eight months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is always fatal.</seg>
<seg id="52">So, now, we can only repeat the question: "How many of us Лоусона rebuild this disease?"</seg>
<seg id="53">According to the UK's leading expert, Professor Джулиану Пито, most likely assume that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain should an individual die about themselves, their success.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most now are not that die that way.</seg>
<seg id="55">Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada telecentres are being set up</seg>
<seg id="56">A quick review of reports from the halls of the court, where victims are often seek compensation, shows how far spread attack мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="57">In this June, for example, Marks & Spencer acknowledged that Ellen Джэнис who have contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, apparel departments at two sites, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs Ellen was only 18 years old, when she started working at M & S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now her two children more than 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Before this happened," she says, "I had never heard about, I barely knew about's Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="62">And in my head I could not come, that it will affect me.</seg>
<seg id="63">Few people really know a lot about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="64">In fact, asbestos is not one substance, and a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">They get their name from the word "асбестиформ", which means the fibrous structure, which gives them the strength and flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="66">Of those six, three were often used in construction.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotile, widely known as white asbestos and other more commonly found in buildings today.</seg>
<seg id="68">It has been used in roofing panels, used his thermal insulation boilers, pipes, Art, even in the Turkish First Football League titles won.</seg>
<seg id="69">He less смертелен than other forms of asbestos, but still recognised by the European Union and the World Health Organization "major source of harm to health," which can lead to death.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, brown asbestos (амозит) and blue asbestos (крокидолит).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts have speculated that "there are good, though indirect reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with attributable to mesothelioma [in the UK]."</seg>
<seg id="72">Employee Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the main store on London's Oxford Street, telecentres are being set up</seg>
<seg id="73">Ellen Джэнис may not have thought of themselves as a victim, but Julian Пито мезотелиомы work suggests that her story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that "a significant percentage of мезотелиом when there is no known exposure at work or at home, were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment."</seg>
<seg id="75">The bulk of this impact, he says, is "a normal use and exposure to weather" in our buildings.</seg>
<seg id="76">No one, it seems, can't be sure that he is safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">The report Goddard Consulting, which was in the palace of Westminster, demonstrates how people, even in the heart of government, could be exposed to unconsciously.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009, Goddard said that technical mines and pipelines for the premises of parliamentary committees were infected with deadly asbestos fibers, which can contain the movement, something so harmless as "strong currents of air."</seg>
<seg id="79">Members of the parliament often blame the fact that they are pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.</seg>
<seg id="80">Although for maintenance of Parliament insisted that Westminster Palace received a "clean bill of health," and now she recognized that it is necessary to work on the £1 billion on reconstruction of Parliament, by upgrading electrician and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, members of parliament, will meet in the conference centre nearby countries, and not on the green benches related.</seg>
<seg id="81">Goddard report noted that "the situation with the asbestos was ruled not in accordance with the various rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">It is impossible to know whether this error management cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All that you can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">One of those who have not managed to identify his contact with asbestos, the cost is Graham, general practitioner.</seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson, the cost, 50 years, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I worked at the hospital, which has successfully brought claims associated with asbestos," he says, "But I can't prove this in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It's so hard to remember all the places where he worked, and dates.</seg>
<seg id="88">What he remembers clearly, so this day in early December 2009 when his wholly overcame something that was like the flu.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly were shaken as me.</seg>
<seg id="91">It started very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terrible.</seg>
<seg id="93">I thought I can't drive all the way to homes.</seg>
<seg id="94">The cost of being a doctor, knew that pain comes from, including checking for iframe loads of shell around the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="95">However, like Джэнис Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect мезотелиому.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the end, he could not walk to work a month.</seg>
<seg id="97">7.8 doctors doing chest x-rays and put плевральные катетеры to pull fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis.</seg>
<seg id="98">And yet his condition оставлось without a diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">Gradually, his health has improved, and he returned to work.</seg>
<seg id="100">But from time to time, those same symptoms returned, often after he engaged in sports, and he breathed heavily.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, one of the patients came to him in Dubai office with similar symptoms, and he was later diagnosed with mesothelioma. ""</seg>
<seg id="102">But even then the cost is not associated with their own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">In the end, his patient was on ten years older and worked directly with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">In this case, the connection was obvious.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011, the situation worsened again, Dubai and showed him his doctor консультировавший results of the CT and X-ray images of the group.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, exactly two years after the cost began to feel ill, sensor, equipped with a camera, was introduced into his chest cavity between the shell and shell of his lung.</seg>
<seg id="107">I'm an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I usually just go further, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="109">I'm not too upset about it, to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife, experienced.</seg>
<seg id="111">Biopsy results came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that it was mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham: Cost диагностирована mesothelioma</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly sank in the cost of meeting with Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested he contact a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">It was then he realised the scale of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turns out that asbestos is widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos was once quite often in the pipes," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, now succumb to the disease.</seg>
<seg id="117">Thus, mesothelioma now affects more young people, atypical professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous isolated asbestos pipes in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees who were on pedestrian tunnels connecting nearby landmasses can bring together to get from one building to another (as Andrew Lawson), or eat in canteens basements (how often did Graham cost) almost certainly really were exposed to toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">For several decades after the war, as it turns out, the hospital was a place where, in theory, life remains in place, but поциентов, which constituted a threat to life for doctors who treated them.</seg>
<seg id="121">It still continues to remove today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students set their burners Бунзена 3rd on tap</seg>
<seg id="123">And it's not just hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and мэриях due to their amazing and fire-resistant insulating characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="125">Schools too.</seg>
<seg id="126">In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the classroom for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="127">Nationwide, on countless chemistry lessons, students set their burners Бунзена 3rd on tap.</seg>
<seg id="128">Websites appeared, highlighting the problem of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as floor tiles or the roofs of the sheds are usually contained asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"It's an industrial poison, in a huge number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Лоусона Guy in a case against the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case, where the only contact with the woman could remember was the demolition garden shed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So be careful, снося garden sheds.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effect of the diagnosis, when we know that the disease is incurable, is huge.</seg>
<seg id="134">"To realize it, is quite a lot of time," says Graham cost.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn't focus on what I'm doing.</seg>
<seg id="136">I spent two weeks in surgery.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I realized that I had to go and deal with them.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I don't meet Christmas</seg>
<seg id="139">One of the most difficult things was the transition from doctor to patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">As countless patients before him, he remembers how confused by the amount of information that had to be taken.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was difficult to understand," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked his doctor" how many I have time? "</seg>
<seg id="143">Gave me about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember, as I thought, "Well, I don't meet Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's all. "</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, as it is the mechanics of how we are in life, "the very act of breathing -- causes cancer, which kills.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases are caused by мезотелиомы contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos is composed of tiny fibers.</seg>
<seg id="149">When asbestos is being destroyed and the carcinogenic fibers, they can get stuck in the lungs, плевре shell.</seg>
<seg id="150">Irritating плевру asbestos fibers and may cause cell mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem is due to the inhalation of asbestos fibres needle," Professor Tom Трежер, кардиоторакальный surgeon, who came to the hospital in 2001, Guy.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is the hospital, where, as suspected, Andrew Lawson, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="153">Трежер knew Лоусона and treated some of the others who, perhaps, was exposed to while working at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">When Western asbestos into the lung tissue, "says Трежер, breathing them unload on the periphery, where the shell.</seg>
<seg id="155">It is, in essence, invasive process from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="156">Conventional treatments of other forms of cancer is much less effective at's.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, cause hot debate.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some think it's worth a try.</seg>
<seg id="159">Трежер disagrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">"You can't cut плевру," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">Cannot be good around her with a knife.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, this cancer is "not very good", which "chemotherapy", but not people.</seg>
<seg id="163">"From time to time there are patients who live a long time," says Трежер.</seg>
<seg id="164">But ultimately, they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some patients are living much, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">Writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after he was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years after diagnosis, Graham cost continues to fight.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he became ill attributable to mesothelioma, Dubai acquainted with Andrew Лоусоном, who, four years after diagnosis, single-handedly turned into offices of support and advice for the same patients.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Yes," its Раковая Central, he said, when they called.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," says the cost of operations.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was diagnosed with four years ago, and he still is very energetic.</seg>
<seg id="172">First Эбботту offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and had prolonged his life only a month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was in despair," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, "managed to somewhat more positive agenda."</seg>
<seg id="176">The cost of meeting with several specialists, decided to continue treatment with Professor Лоиком Ланж-Лаздунски institutes, professor of surgery at Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage in that I don't need directions, I just called them and they took me," admits Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">The consultants would have to get the direction and approval for funding.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money plays a decisive role for patients with attributable to mesothelioma, in order to get the best available treatments.</seg>
<seg id="180">But when such treatments become ineffective, finally, inevitably, many patients face another financial reason for concern "about the future of the families that they would leave.</seg>
<seg id="181">And then they ask the courts for compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan, of Field Fisher Price Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It has been known that asbestos is harmful to human health, since 1898," said Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But that changed in the 1960s, it became clear that even very small quantities can put their health at risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">It was then spoke about the bad faith of companies.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and hospital Guy, ultimately, resolve the matter, but this was not a "settlement" at full price, according to Morgan, as Lawson could not prove unequivocally that it was the result of mesothelioma is exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation into his death, hospital spokesman Guy finally confirmed, however, that "asbestos in its basement, mentioned above, was removed in the 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="188">It was too late for Andrew Лоусона.</seg>
<seg id="189">How to remove asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">In fact, tie deadly contact with asbestos to one company or place of work - usually through dozens of years after that - it turned out to be a big problem for patients with attributable to mesothelioma, demanding compensation.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers replaced owner or shut down.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance archives could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who have protected from lawsuits, knows that time is on their side, plaintiffs have, of course, no.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, this year took serious new legislative acts which facilitate the process of recovery attributable to mesothelioma patients with compensation, even if it is impossible to keep track of their former employers.</seg>
<seg id="195">In accordance with this law, was created £350-миллионный fund of funds, which is financed by the insurance industry, for those who had been diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove the contact, but not anyone with whom to sue.</seg>
<seg id="196">In such cases, patients will receive 80 percent of the amount that the court could award in a case for compensation - about £120000.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful claims under this scheme is expected to be every year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with attributable to mesothelioma, believes that the £350 million represent a "very good job" for the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"This transaction, insured for insurers," he says, hinting that the sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay if it had not intervened, with a temporary period attributable to mesothelioma patients and would have been able to trace the company and sue in the usual way.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even Mike Пеннинг, previously minister for work and pensions, acknowledged that the law "imperfect."</seg>
<seg id="201">However, Morgan and Пеннинг and admit that, though seven people die every day, rapid action was needed.</seg>
<seg id="202">"People suffer so much, and they need help now," said Пеннинг during the Bill's second reading in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">By the time Graham cost was in the hands of Professor Лоика Ланж-Лаздунски 19 months.</seg>
<seg id="204">After the initial consultation Ланж-Лаздунски recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Трежера, he believes to be effective.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was followed by radiation and chemotherapy -- in which тритерапия Ланж-Лаздунски boasts a solid 40 percent of patients surviving for five years.</seg>
<seg id="206">The cost of felt a surge of strength.</seg>
<seg id="207">"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says the cost of operations.</seg>
<seg id="208">You see these patients all the time.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is a force that supports you.</seg>
<seg id="210">When сдаешься, condition can deteriorate very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham went to the cost of the operation in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">By the end of August he finished last of six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">Subsequent scans showed no trace of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I did a scan in March [2014].</seg>
<seg id="215">There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I just had to happen 50.</seg>
<seg id="217">This is not a threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="218">This is the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="219">And again, the cost being passed through six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now there is no trace of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="221">However, this process is both physically and emotionally heavy.</seg>
<seg id="222">You can think about practical things - about finances, and when I die, for example, or about the fact that we need to show his wife, works as a timer on бойлере.</seg>
<seg id="223">When you get bad news, you become безрадостным.</seg>
<seg id="224">You just have to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="225">As the father of Ellie, 16, and 14 years, this Тэмзин is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">"It's hard for the parent," he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.</seg>
<seg id="228">For the first time when I was diagnosed, I told the girls that I had the disease, which means that I won ’ t live to old age.</seg>
<seg id="229">They reacted very differently.</seg>

<seg id="236">The disease is sex (even as, ultimately, for Steven Jay Гулда) grim certainty.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose their leaders; protesters promise revenge</seg>
<seg id="2">China's parliament decided Sunday to not allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reforms.</seg>
<seg id="3">Such a move is likely to mark the beginning of being long protests in Hong Kong as activists have begun planning and mobilization in a matter of hours after that statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The National People's Congress, in essence, allows the communist leaders, who did not remove all the candidates loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's not обмануло our expectations, but still leads in rage," said legislator Emily VAH, chairman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is not something that Beijing has promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">They lied to the people of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defending the decision of China, Li Fei, the deputy general secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that to allow national elections to nominate the head of the Hong Kong protests "would be too much."</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing promised to allow residents of the region to choose the head of government by voting, starting in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Sunday, Chinese leaders have taken the decision as a democratic step forward, since it gives a direct vote гонконгцам right; however, the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold in their hands with the assistance of the Commission on the appointment of candidates, rigidly controlled from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, according to a new article that only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be admitted.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision was taken after a summer in which some of the most ambitious and have received broad publicity protests in Hong Kong for many years.</seg>
<seg id="14">A big part of the campaign after Occupy Central movement in Hong Kong is With Love and Peace, which threatened to cut off the financial district in Hong Kong if Beijing does not guarantee a real universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday evening, several hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="16">The demonstration, which organisers claimed that their movement is shifting to a new phase of civil disobedience and that they rise up on the waves of protest in the next few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, they have not announced details, apparently seeking to avoid problems with government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In онлайн-заявлении organizers reported that free movement "обдумывало capture central district only as exceptional measures, actions that may be taken only if all the possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We regret to inform you that today, all possibilities have been exhausted and the seizure of the central district of dialogue will take place.</seg>
<seg id="20">Authorities in Hong Kong were preparing to Beijing a few days, and on Sunday at the headquarters of the government had strengthened security measures involving police and barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">The unrest is the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their own city.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also reinforced fears that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement, saying that his demonstration to jeopardize the businesses - the lifeblood of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protest, which they say, it can lead to great economic damage, depending on how many people will participate, and for how long," said the legislator, Regina Yip, who has long been critical of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="26">We do not want to spread concern about the fact that Hong Kong can spin out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This view, which is harmful for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chinese state media also gave reports in recent days, in which the activists of the democratic movement in Hong Kong were shown off, pursue Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral law, which drew 780000 participants - more than one-fifth of voters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in July, tens of thousands took to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists brought up the issue of race and the behaviour of the police after Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">Unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Фергюсоне, Missouri, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">Coming raise their hands, chanting: "Hands up, don't стреляй" while they wait in line in front of the burial.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Missouri, Фергюсоне connected with the murder of teenager Michael Brown, blogger% Miriam зоила Perez noticed a shift in интернет-разговоре among white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">In her experience, the white feminists stamps comments put gender above race, when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, as the tension grew in the Midwest and attracted national attention, Peres saw the responses of white women who is 100 percent focused on the race.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared with the reaction of black women shortly after the killing on 9 August, personal essays with such titles as "thoughts about Фергюсоне on behalf of a white woman" and "Феминизм - it's not just about housing for women" appeared relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Perez, they demonstrated a significant shift.</seg>
<seg id="9">"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who are talking about white skin and Privileges on such a high level," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People felt the need to say something about what has happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's very symbolic for the crisis with which we are faced, and because (the situation in Фергюсоне) is so tied to race, they feel that it is necessary to specify.</seg>
<seg id="12">For Professor of English at the University of Ohio Кориты Mitchell Ferguson laid bare problems that blacks face every day, but one which wasn't perceived as "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner and get 150 лайков from everywhere," says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">When I write something about how the colored people are attacked in his own country, Super Duper silence.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Why do women safely publicly talk about relationships, but not about the security in the public sector?" She asks.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women, like Mitchell, who studied questions of race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between matters relating to race and gender.</seg>
<seg id="17">From her point of view, blacks, women are in a position to clearly separate the problems; they are faced with a complex reality every day.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women now bring together issues of race and gender in feminist мейнстриме, Энджела Хэттери, professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that its predecessor did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 1865 and 1890 years линчевали at least 10,000 black men, and the reason that is almost always served as the rape of white women," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="20">There was a white woman, the story was to motivate people.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the point of view of Хэттери, the gap between white and black women occurred when White free, for example, Susan B. Anthony looked at the situation in the late 1800s, and saw that the fight for suffrage will be effective only for one of the groups: Women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They decided to lay all the eggs in the basket of voting rights for women, and the right to vote for blacks would appear later," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="23">Look back on things like this gives us a clear idea of why colored women don't trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have not done anything good.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to ensure that the white women united against mob lynchings in the South for the women to prevent mob lynchings.</seg>
<seg id="27">This group appeared nearly 40 years after he was first asked to help blacks, women, Mitchell said.</seg>
<seg id="28">From the point of view of Mitchell, the reactions of white feminists on the issues raised in the Фергюсоне situation, "police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white a feminist had to" catch up "problems with whom blacks women справлялись in several generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"However, it would be great if a militant, which have such a [traditional] феминистическая ideology, just seriously would be to raise a child, as they relate to the right to contraception?" Asked Mitchell.</seg>

<seg id="33">Although Стайнем guarantee for more пересекающийся feminism that involves issues of race, gender, and her comments about race in America still fascinate some.</seg>
<seg id="34">The American entrepreneurial Institute researcher Christina Соммерс, author of "Who stole feminism?," she said She The People that young men in the United States, especially young people of color, "are much more vulnerable than their sisters," but the group Стайнем Фергюсоне contradict criticism, which she previously clear.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now we have hundreds of specialized programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for the boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">But when the White House has recently initiated a programme of "Сторож, my brother," in order to help vulnerable black and испаноговорящим men, followed the US changed remarkably from many feminists, including Gloria Стайнем.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric vehicle market</seg>
<seg id="2">This week the Ministry of Economic Development will make the government a comprehensive plan for the development of clean vehicles in Russia, told the deputy director of the Department of the Ministry of Oleg Плужников at the round table, which held the newspaper Vedomosti declared in Moscow - 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">The plan drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals - reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is expected that the document will be passed in late September and early October, says Плужников, proposed measures concern the development of electric cars and hybrids - vehicles газомоторном plan to fuel in Russia are already there.</seg>
<seg id="5">(A copy of the plan obtained by Vedomosti is designed for 2014-2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">Will develop criteria for assessment of electricity and hybrid vehicles and decide how to promote the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">The government report, which will be described in the tax and customs measures quality support, will be prepared by December 2014; concessional lending scheme and preferential hiring will appear by April 2015; and the proposal to reduce prices, stimulate the creation of infrastructure and service will be developed by October 2015</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014-2015, is expected to make changes to regulations to ease conditions for building infrastructure (зарядной in carparks, filling stations, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, federal officials intend to for 2015 to formulate proposals for regional authorities, as well as to promote the use of clean transport - in the form of granting him benefits when traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and proposals on the expansion of the government purchases of such transport.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, the Ministry of Economic Development by October 2014, on a list of indicators to assess the regional authorities of criteria that reflect the effectiveness of support production of environmentally clean transport, infrastructure development зарядной.</seg>
<seg id="11">Electric vehicle market in Russia, while only formed in 2013 across the country sold around 100 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="12">In early 2014 обнулена import duty on electric cars, so sales will be approximately 500 pieces, predicts CEO of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey Pankov.</seg>
<seg id="13">But 56 does not increase any noticeable: Electric cars in Russia in 2013, according to the Association of European Businesses, sold segment million cars and light commercial vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="14">While Sunderland in Russia imports only Mitsubishi Motors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Start import preparing Renault - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says director for strategic planning and partnerships in Russia Renault Nicolas Ремиз.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most of the other manufacturers of electric transport took in relation to Russia is taking a wait-and-see approach.</seg>
<seg id="17">There are electric vehicle development and Russian manufacturers GAZ directors "," ",", "but the trivial.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in January - July 2014, according to the "АСМ-холдинга," Avtovaz has issued 30 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="19">Demand is also degrading because of soaring prices, admits director of AvtoVAZ 7-8 Sergei Аманов, without state support the breakthrough in this segment will not.</seg>
<seg id="20">The development of the Russian market in addition to the new electric cars (those electric cars that are sold in Russia, on average, twice as much as analogues with internal combustion engines) holds an underdeveloped infrastructure зарядной (retails sites - units), "sighs Автостата General Sergei Целиков.</seg>
<seg id="21">Because of the soaring prices and low rates of reducing the cost of electric cars in the next 3-4 years remain нишевым segment of the Russian market, "predicts editor-in-chief Mikhail Подорожанский Целиков Авторевю, agrees with him.</seg>
<seg id="22">Car manufacturers, in contrast, say that some models of electric cars are already close to normal.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Russian market has substantially good prospects, the important thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "real" электромобильность; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of new charging stations, underscores the President BMW Group in Russia Wolfgang Шлимме.</seg>
<seg id="24">Such infrastructure projects, for example, sells "госкомпания Россети": In Moscow built several stations, will soon have about 80.</seg>
<seg id="25">Talks about building a network of retails sites and negotiations with other regions.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to Director of "Россетей" Vladimir Софьина, the company believes the market is ready to build electric and gas stations across the country, but there are problems: A small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric cars of various brands.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, "Россети" as network the company does not have the right to engage in the sale of electricity, the ability to do this in relation to charge electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="28">His wife believes the most effective measure in support of Russia's electric vehicle market progeSOFT customs duties.</seg>
<seg id="29">Zero rate will act before the end of 2014, its expansion, the extension of the preferential list.</seg>
<seg id="30">The replacement vehicle tax on ecological (the idea is being discussed and concerns all machines), too, will support the market, but not as noticeably as customs preferences, his wife said.</seg>
<seg id="31">Transport tax in Russia is small, said Pankov, unlike, for example, from Norway, where the reduced tax rate led to a sharp increase in electric sales - now they account for 12% of the market.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, and the need for stimulus measures, such as free parking in the city centre (as has been done in Moscow), I am sure Pankov, or to travel on dedicated lanes between what Russia does not.</seg>

<seg id="7">The weakening of the ruble is long-term in nature and, in tandem with the euro, and in tandem with the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="8">The long-term forecast assumed that mark, "says senior analyst at Alpari Bodrov's" Anna ".</seg>
<seg id="9">All of that has to do with Ukraine, one way or another will be reflected on the courses.</seg>

<seg id="22">Worrying times for the foreign exchange market, I would like to remind you that at the end of January, when an increased demand for the currency, as well as 3rd March, when the Central Bank отгрузил a record number of currencies.</seg>
<seg id="23">In UFS IC and see the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="24">First of all, it is the growth of the regional budget from export operations, as well as improving the competitiveness of domestic manufacturers at the expense of more expensive imports, says chief analyst UFS IC Alexei Kozlov.</seg>
<seg id="25">Negative moments can be attributed to the price of imported goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, rising inflationary pressure, and, as a result, become more expensive for borrowing funds which, in turn, slows down the development of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="27">If we talk about the stock market, the rouble devaluation of identity, a decline in stock prices, expressed in roubles.</seg>
<seg id="28">For example, the MICEX index during trading Thursday fell 1.67 per cent, while the RTS Index lost 3.27 percent.</seg>
<seg id="29">Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of reduction of indices due to a weakening of the ruble during the day more than 1.5 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="30">The weakening of the ruble is an emotional character and can be explained by a massive desire to buy the currency.</seg>
<seg id="31">In practice, gradually go on emotions, and quotes the ruble partially or fully restore some lost ground.</seg>
<seg id="32">"We believe, soon we will be able to see the value of the dollar and the Russian currency is near the level of 36 rubles to the dollar," said Alexei Kozlov.</seg>

<seg id="2">Восстанавливающаяся economy means more customers, the more sales and jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Account for taxes on the state and local level for companies across the country, moderately increased in the past year, when the economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study, published last week, and companies in the Washington area is no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion in the coffers of the state and local level in fiscal 2013, to 3.8 percent more than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tax burden on business in the state and local level in the past year rose by 4.3 per cent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent the year before, and it was the third straight year of growth after lending each other years, when accounts are smaller, in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">State taxes, rose 4.3 per cent, faster than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to the research, which was carried out by professional services firm, Ernst & Young and the taxation of the taxation policy group.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the tax revenue in the county, 56 percent, in taxes on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of tax revenue for Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the amount of tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="10">To a large extent, is caused by the growth of tax revenues return to the same level of value of property companies, researchers say that raised taxes on real estate by 3.7 per cent this year, after three years in a row, when growth was less than 1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large proportion of these revenues are concentrated in big states such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same thing is happening in the Washington area.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion in property taxes at the state and local level in the past year, to $9.6 billion more than in 2012, an increase of 4.2 per cent, compared with the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the observed return on the value of the property does not have a similar effect on growth in tax revenues for state and local level in Maryland, where property taxes are unlikely to exceed one-fifth of companies' tax bills.</seg>
<seg id="14">Virginia and the District of Columbia pay tax accounts for about half of the state and local level, in the form of taxes on real estate.</seg>
<seg id="15">"What is happening in Maryland is that such a large part of their property, particularly tax base around the District of Columbia, is owned by either the government or nonprofit organization that does not pay taxes on real estate," said Douglas Линдхолм, executive director of the Center for State of taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, Maryland is forced to rely more on, for example, income taxes to pay for those services that exist in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent increase in tax receipts from businesses cannot fully explain the recovery of the real estate market.</seg>
<seg id="18">Income entrepreneurs also, it seems, are on the mend, according to these data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Chinese companies may increasingly raise capital in the region's corporate income tax at the state level in the amount of $2.3 billion to $2.1 billion more than in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland has collected $1 billion of corporate income tax, the most in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although trends are aimed in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase with the same speed in all three areas.</seg>
<seg id="22">The level of growth in the District of Columbia was on the same level as the average across the country, 4.3 per cent, while growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 percent.</seg>

<seg id="24">In Virginia was the lowest corporate income tax from three jurisdictions (each of whom the same corporate rate) equal to 6 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Maryland corporate rate of 8.25 percent, whereas in the District is relatively high - 9,975 percent.</seg>
<seg id="26">A similar study of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that in Virginia lower taxes for entrepreneurs on the state and local level and, on the whole, a more favorable climate in terms of taxes for entrepreneurs than in Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="27">The county was not assessed in this study.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite his advantage, Virginia is facing competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south.</seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina recently signed a legislative act, as corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="30">If the state will continue to reach for tax purposes in the country next year, this law could bring income tax rate for entrepreneurs, even up to 3 per cent by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="31">Meanwhile, a small business in the Washington area, it seems, feels better and, thus, pay more in taxes to the state and local level, according to a recent study.</seg>
<seg id="32">Taxes for entrepreneurs, in the form of individual income tax paid by the owners of small businesses - a transitional structure, in which most small firms are arranged in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, with much greater speed of growth than taxes for предпринимателй in general.</seg>
<seg id="33">The researchers say that the trend and an increase in revenues from taxes on businesses across the country are likely to persist this year, when tax revenues, with turnover in the governments of the state and local level, staying at 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.</seg>

<seg id="2">The sale of the group ’ s debut album Royal Blood - the new hope of British rock, выведшей рок-дуэты clubs straight from the stadiums.</seg>
<seg id="3">The duo Royal Blood all year on the stage, but already has a nomination for its music prize, for a tour and a visit to the Arctic Monkeys gig from the New York-based гримерку Jimmy Пейджа.</seg>
<seg id="4">Their debut album, Leif even for a few months before release received 100,000 предзаказов contract, but the issue lies in the portfolio will Warner Music.</seg>
<seg id="5">Given the present situation on the market, a musical плачевную situation is extraordinary, lambasted for not talking about new Lana del Ray, or another сладкоголосом a new 'R' n 'B', and about the British duo быковатых appearance, playing with the level of volume and intensity, that the last time was in vogue two decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">In general, rates on the first album in connection with all вышеозначенными circumstances were especially high and is already quite justified.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is no coincidence that the duo took his name, which previously could encroach on that isn't quite so desperate and hairy metalheads, which flows the blood of kings, how they think, they have in the veins, too clear.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is, of course, first and foremost about the heroes of the past levels of Led Zeppelin, and the great quartet, Royal Blood aim to shake застоявшуюся blood British rock, put it to a new level.</seg>
<seg id="9">To make predictions about the success of this enterprise until, perhaps, the thought, but something we can say already.</seg>
<seg id="10">A dozen songs, уложившихся in thirty minutes with a little - it's not so much a demonstration of the phenomenal композиторского gifts, how powerful and behave like a declaration of intent.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some of the dignity of individual service, of course, cannot be denied: The pilot say, single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by the fact that the south is not melodic line, and drum party.</seg>
<seg id="12">The musicians say that in jest, that song is generally easier than настучать напеть.</seg>
<seg id="13">Select is also a powerful "Little Monster" and will record the song "Better Strangers" with Midsummer quote in the title.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the truth is that each of these songs would sound great at a party hard rock fans, but when playing in a row they merge into a more or less uniform cloth.</seg>
<seg id="15">And this is not necessarily bad, on the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="16">Force Royal Blood in the fact that they do not claim the new Lennon and McCartney (a mark in successors Motörhead), but numerous рок-дуэты инди-клубов moved out of the ghetto.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their music, despite some variety, created for the stadiums, in the room, less than a couple of thousand people, she is obviously closely.</seg>
<seg id="18">The secret lies in using хитром bass, guitar took the usual format, придуманном zero at the beginning of December.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, it is not only the instruments, but also in the approach to writing songs.</seg>
<seg id="20">Heroes ретророка zero with great difficulty outside выбирались postmodern paradigm, with great reluctance, then went on to admit himself not just эпигонами and independent creative units.</seg>
<seg id="21">Royal Blood same now sound so heavily and the subsequent pressure that this successful and some драпирует вторичность твердолобость musical material.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cunning ways to save on university textbooks</seg>
<seg id="2">Though the cost of university textbooks for many students more than $1000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move to the second course, came up with an ingenious way to reduce costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">He developed a system of how to borrow books from старшекурсников rental, offering them rated compensation that they delayed their sale.</seg>
<seg id="4">"My textbook on mathematical analysis, which typically costs $180, I got on a semester for $10 and biscuits" Chick-fil-A "," says Schroeder, 19, who studies at Ковенант College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The literature on last semester cost would be $430, he says.</seg>
<seg id="6">He spent $120.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the Council, the average college student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and educational background, but the students have a range of options to reduce these costs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Students are increasingly choosing online stores, and creative ideas such as the system. ’</seg>
<seg id="9">Rent books is becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book for the semester, and is often significantly cheaper than buying them.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Нибо Инкорпорейтид", which holds more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of rental books grew by half since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">Industry studies show that about a quarter of books in university bookstores during the past spring semester were taken, "said vice president of rental Нибо" Trevor Meyer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Less than half of all books sold in university bookstores, according to the National Association, a professional association of university shops. "</seg>
<seg id="13">Here's introductory course on the best ways to commit a great deal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Buying in online store</seg>
<seg id="15">Sometimes, if you'll come out with a new book on the Internet, the cost could be one-third from the one that you'll see in the university bookshop.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis," Ron Larson ’ s Bruce Edwards and Robert Хостетлера worth about $290 privately, but a new instance can be purchased for $239,99 on site Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Buying a used</seg>
<seg id="18">If you don't mind other people's notes or injuries, second-hand textbooks are a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Mathematical analysis" sold for $93,49 подержанном form on to Chegg.com.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Кэсэдей, 25 years later, a fourth year student at the University of Бригэм Young, says that paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for the textbook used copy of "strategic decisions in the media: An understanding of the business side of the advertising business."</seg>
<seg id="21">The book sold for $48.</seg>
<seg id="22">Teachers, for instance, Ingrid Брейси, director of "without walls" College at the University of Massachusetts in Эмхерсте, offers students refine their professors, it could use previous editions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates are insignificant for classes.</seg>
<seg id="24">In such cases, the old editions can often be found in a very small fraction of the cost of the latest edition.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition to websites Amazon and Chegg, Half.com, "owned by eBay Inc.," is a popular alternative to buying second-hand books.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hire</seg>
<seg id="27">About to take textbooks, it is worth a thought, if you're good enough to deal with them, don't forget to return them and don't want to leave them yourself after the course is completed.</seg>
<seg id="28">You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, a student could rent a "Математический analysis" for a semester, for about $20.</seg>
<seg id="30">The rules on the store, where you take books, including any fines that you can write the check, and to underscore the damage.</seg>
<seg id="31">If you take a book, remember: If you don't give the book, fines may even exceed the cost of the new instance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Electronic books</seg>
<seg id="33">Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks is another option.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sometimes such books actually take car purchasing electronic license for a certain period for retailers, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Rent" on the site Chegg.com Mathematical Analysis for six months will cost about $61.</seg>
<seg id="36">Брейси says that students who study literature, can often find the most advantageous prices, since many of the classics, you can now download free, whereas literature on natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.</seg>
<seg id="37">No matter what, осмотритесь.</seg>
<seg id="38">Joe reports, 29 years old, which is going to start their studies in high school, and recommends Legal Пеппердин use ISBN number to book prices, as this will ensure that you are looking for precisely the right you text.</seg>
<seg id="39">But before you order online, reports said, be sure to check whether a book is in stock.</seg>
<seg id="40">To him this lesson Hemsedal hard.</seg>
<seg id="41">The book, which he bought, was postponed for four weeks, and, in the end, he paid the full price at the university bookstore.</seg>

<seg id="41">The country banned the import of beef, pork, a by-product from meat and poultry, and meat delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cheese, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausage and sugar syrups.</seg>
<seg id="42">Restaurants have begun jockeying seems with suppliers: Prices of products grown, you must urgently seek counterparts from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="43">This will affect the most expensive restaurants with монокухней France, Italy, Spain, in which products supplied directly from "motherships" countries.</seg>
<seg id="44">Общепиту had earlier etc.</seg>
<seg id="45">For example, when, at the beginning of 2014, the Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and the year before - the American and Canadian meat.</seg>
<seg id="46">Suppliers established in return for supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="47">But sanctions лета-2014 were far more serious.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which lifted the ban on Atlantic salmon and trout fry high dimension seed potatoes, milk, sugar, corn, peas and onions for replanting.</seg>

<seg id="56">In restaurants with mixed cuisine are starting to replace dishes, for example steak from marble beef - on бефстроганов, says Sergei Mironov.</seg>
<seg id="57">"Cheeses from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian cheeses and cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," lists the "East-West" Oksana Глибчук.</seg>

<seg id="8">After all, if there is a policy to refund without him каско Help traffic police was impossible.</seg>
<seg id="9">Parameters laid out in the draft guidelines, designed to eliminate this obstacle in the way of implementing "европротокола" in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to them, the maximum payout for каско in connection with the accident, without the police, must not be lower than the limit "европротоколу."</seg>
<seg id="11">But at the same time, it may not be higher than the limit specified in the agreement, insurance каско.</seg>
<seg id="12">The idea, of course, useful and theoretically capable of relieving both Smith and roads.</seg>
<seg id="13">But, most likely, it will not delight in any car drivers, nor insurers.</seg>
<seg id="14">The last now talk about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which could lead to the introduction of new rules on payments каско.</seg>
<seg id="15">As for the drivers, it's hard to imagine what kind of work will have to be done in order to overcome the Al Qaeda-related conservatism.</seg>
<seg id="16">In most cases, the driver would be hours to wait for the inspectors to arrange small accident, because it was new.</seg>
<seg id="17">And it remains to be seen what will be simpler - beat swindlers or convince drivers in reliability "европротокола."</seg>
<seg id="18">Savings certificate will be registered and безотзывным</seg>
<seg id="19">The Ministry of Finance wants ban on bearer savings certificates, but will allow banks to make their analogue безотзывного contribution.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Finance Ministry is preparing a bill that would prohibit savings certificates to bearer.</seg>
<seg id="21">In recent years, this tool is gaining popularity, as rates are higher here than on bank deposits.</seg>
<seg id="22">The fact is that savings certificates on the bearer not the bank deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper because they don't have to make payments to the Fund Deposit Insurance Agency (pointed out).</seg>
<seg id="23">Ambitious situation in the fact that this step will be taken because of the small and medium-sized banks, spreading such certificates, and suffer from Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which, according to estimates, 98 percent pointed to market demand.</seg>
<seg id="24">With the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, is about 3.5%.</seg>
<seg id="25">The problem, pointed out, the explanation lies in the fact that a small bank customers, who bought such a certificate, in case of license revocation is trying to get money from him in pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying bearer savings certificates, may assume that their investment is insured.</seg>
<seg id="27">The absence of reasonable insurance payments on these certificated in case of license revocation bank can lead to misunderstandings and social tensions.</seg>
<seg id="28">In practice, agencies have been occasions when holders of certificates предъявительских tried to seek insurance redress through the court, "he said in a pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="29">The problem, of course, made-up.</seg>
<seg id="30">The certificates pay buyers still nobody will, by law, because they have no right to compensation from the State.</seg>
<seg id="31">If this was in fact an instrument that is insured, not the pointed, together with him and would have banned metal accounts, which means citizens are recorded in grams of one of four metals: Gold, silver, platinum and palladium.</seg>
<seg id="32">Since these accounts do not fall into a system of deposit insurance, but their existence as long as no one deprives.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is likely that the bearer certificates are very convenient valuable paper that actually can act in the role of квазиденег.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the same time, their movement almost does not control: Any customer bank can buy a certificate to any citizen, and I was such a certificate may change a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is not by chance that the draft that savings certificate should be necessarily personal security, which must be stored in depositories.</seg>
<seg id="36">But Putin, added that banks are allowed to issue such certificates without the right to early redemption.</seg>
<seg id="37">That is a similar безотзывного contribution, which has long been a dream of the bankers.</seg>

<seg id="1">Met two Union</seg>
<seg id="2">The talks in Minsk Summit has not solved the problems for which were called back, but created a new format: The first face of the European Union met with the chief executives of the Eurasian future</seg>
<seg id="3">And let the disturbing drift toward the situation around Ukraine (very urgent does not tolerate), the leaders of the EU and Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of "hot issues."</seg>
<seg id="4">Whether or not this structure can work effectively, it is not clear; but it is clear who took the cream from that summit.</seg>
<seg id="5">Questions on this one evening on August 26, when the Belarusians, and followed them and other евразийцы with Europeans saw a television news report about the new President Lukashenko.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Belarusian leader showed an example of polished talent, this was the behaviour of a man who had just caught the jackpot - and is planning a decent old age in high society.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Maidan Lukashenko helped</seg>
<seg id="8">The arrival in Minsk just three main European commissioners (EU) ministers, who met Lukashenko and allowed him to perform on the final briefing on their behalf -- not just with President легитимация 20-years experience.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is an application for recognition of a full European policy and the main subject on the campaign of the Ukrainian crisis.</seg>
<seg id="10">A senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Studies Denis Мельянцов sure: From now on, Brussels will not already talk to Minsk in the same tone as before.</seg>
<seg id="11">"What Catherine Ashton met face to face with Lukashenko, gives reason to believe that the relationship with the EU will be размораживаться and beyond," he said "Огоньку."</seg>
<seg id="12">This is the tip of the iceberg: The hidden part of the preparations for the breakthrough the Belarusian authorities began long before November Maidan in Kiev - summer 2013-го.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The results have been achieved and the EU is the successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues about modernization," lists "Огонька interlocutor," and with the United States have held talks on international security.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the United States removed the sanctions a little.</seg>
<seg id="15">As regards the Ukrainian events, they and the reaction to them Belarus only invoked another influx of this process.</seg>
<seg id="16">Minsk, on the one hand, managed to preserve relations with Ukraine are warm enough, not much to lose in mutual trade, but President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for talks.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who admitted not de jure joining of Crimea to Russia and has urged to punish pro-Russian militia in the Donbas with all severity, and quarreled with Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="18">Minsk came out neither the Customs Union nor from the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), and sometimes it is placed in a Russian air base.</seg>
<seg id="19">Brussels and Washington have noticed a balanced position of Minsk to the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated her confident Belarusian experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">How successful will the diversification of Lukashenko's political movement, will be seen as often in the near future to meet in Minsk доведется EU format + TC.</seg>
<seg id="21">The press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy Catherine Ashton and diplomacy have failed to answer questions about what Brussels expects relations in the new format.</seg>
<seg id="22">A spokesman for Ashton said only "Maya Косьянчич Огоньку" that decisions on issues of war and peace, this issue is not a priority.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the same time, there were reports that following a meeting point for the Ukrainian issue involving high-ranking officials in the new format may be, and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="24">A drop of tar in Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that about him, it turns out, personally asked the representatives of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nonetheless, on final briefing Alexander Lukashenko made it clear: All sides don't mind that Minsk has remained the central platform for meetings in both format Россия--ОБСЕ--Украина, and at the level of Heads of State and high representatives of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="26">This means that "the last dictator in Europe" quite рукопожатного acquires the status of a European leader who helps solve a global problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">Farmer's best friend</seg>
<seg id="28">Already the EU delegation, which included еврокомиссаров on trade and energy, pushed to the conclusion: The main reason the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbas, and economy.</seg>
<seg id="29">In fact, the meeting сверстанное schedule future negotiations on the supply of gas and to overcome fears the CU on the agreement about an association between Ukraine and the EU looks more robust than the achievement of peace declaration without specific dates and numbers.</seg>
<seg id="30">Trade Commissioner Karl De Гюхт, however, showed the: EU officials "arrived in Minsk seek solution to the political crisis which has economic consequences, and not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="31">It seems, however, that the economy and the crisis in Ukraine "works" in Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its consequences - and primarily reciprocal sanctions from the West and Russia, offer cut-price, which still feels itself санкционное pressure, the long-awaited room for maneuver.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to the head of the Mises Research Centre, the presidents of Belarus Yaroslav Ramanchuk, European investors are actively interested in opportunities for agricultural supplies to Belarus in bypassing sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the same time, schemes are nominated for which Vladimir Putin at the summit пожурил Minsk.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Initiated these schemes," said Romanchuk "Огоньку," are not the Belarusian businessmen and Russian companies.</seg>
<seg id="36">They have long worked on the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes were destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Russian businesses urgently need to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of the Belarusian authorities.</seg>
<seg id="38">The second story, "the expert continues," is linked to the fact that many Ukrainian companies not averse to establish production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials also focusing on the Russian market.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Ukrainian producers about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and the Belarusian производственно-торговые scheme now could be very popular. "</seg>
<seg id="40">According to Ramanchuk, the role of the host site for the negotiations, the EU and the CU is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of the development of economic ties with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="41">He recalls that the loss of the agricultural sector of the EU sanctions against Moscow are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the Commission is currently proposed аграриям only 125 million euros compensation.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Belarusian president could offer to Brussels to work together to minimise the consequences for еврофермеров.</seg>
<seg id="43">This could raise the authority of Lukashenko in the EU on the height.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hospitality without initiatives</seg>
<seg id="45">Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative for the summit.</seg>
<seg id="46">But the paradox is that the official Minsk from his active role in the birth of the CU + EU открещивается format, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with Ukrainian counterpart emphasized that the initiator of a new format and it was Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="47">"It was your suggestion to come without навала discuss, not with бухты-барахты decide, after signing the Association Agreement with the EU, to sort out the situation, which at the time was in Ukraine," he said in front of cameras to Peter Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, observers interpreted it as an attempt to soothe Moscow, according to the rumours, she was initially against the intermediation of Minsk, which greatly increases his political weight.</seg>
<seg id="49">In Belarusian diplomatic establishment carefully emphasize that cooperation between the EU and Belarus with the organization on its soil does not pursue the goal of pursuing such a format, but the ultimate goal is to create in the future, a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.</seg>
<seg id="50">"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts which, in other fields, in particular in the field of security, raises and promotes leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation," said "Огоньку" in Belarus, the Foreign Office, where in the last time words were chosen very carefully.</seg>

<seg id="2">Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez film "City грехов-2: Woman, for which it did not kill" the revolution that it might have been expected.</seg>
<seg id="3">The first "City of sins" (2005), at minimum, but symbolic, participation of Tarantino, made a revolution in the relationship between movies, comic books and literary нуаром.</seg>
<seg id="4">The sequel is revolutionary in its own way, too: In the sense that it erodes fundamental to modern thinking chain "thesis" dimples "synthesis" (if you understand as a thesis and antithesis нуара universe, the cosmos - comic books).</seg>
<seg id="5">From now on, it should read: "Thesis" dimples "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="6">"City" грехов-2 хаотичен драматургическом, and on and on the philosophical level, both times he was in a bad mood хаотичен sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="7">Yes, the characters are familiar for the first part of "City," though, behold, громила Марв Рурк (Mickey), I remember, had finished life to death by electric chair, and then, nothing, just to rile and - in the role of crushed popular дружинника - from air knives and axes with удавками.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the elderly literally расталкивают elbows newcomers like вломившиеся in the city from some other movie, about the sense and the plot which spectators are asked not to worry.</seg>
<seg id="9">So, our own history, shamelessly оборванная authors in an interesting spot, суперудачливого player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt's).</seg>
<seg id="10">His own - похотливо-фригидной Eve Lord (Eva Green) and her line for Dwight (Josh Бролин).</seg>
<seg id="11">But this confusion, in which Dwight in, say, a person cannot distinguish from Johnny - all the more so as a person, and other parts of the body, demolishing characters with unrelenting regularity, "not a problem, and not even only half the problem.</seg>
<seg id="12">It's not people, we understand that this is a fatal flaw: Archetypes нуара smoothly, too confident player, "угодивший медовую trap" sex, Detective corrupt упырь-сенатор.</seg>
<seg id="13">Well, when the archetype вальсирует with an archetype and an archetype погоняет, it is no longer a movie, and that therein an abstract painting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Abstract painting and ask questions about the logic of the story is simply ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="15">Besides, even in this суматошном world is something permanent.</seg>
<seg id="16">Fighting from the first whore "City" still keep circular defense from their native осаждающих slums forces of darkness.</seg>
<seg id="17">Yes and no, the ghost of detective Хартигана yes and came to light, and the Bruce Willis it's always nice to look at.</seg>
<seg id="18">The main problem, "Cities грехов-2" is in another.</seg>
<seg id="19">Frank Miller was good, because both рисовальщик талантливо joined comic and нуар, and as a director, turned an idea of how to migrate comics on the screen.</seg>
<seg id="20">Comic and нуар - two aggressively opposing "reality."</seg>
<seg id="21">Localized phenomenon in modern form was born in the late 1920s, at the same time, when novels Дэшила Хэммета receive "harvest" (1929), "went" (1930) and "Glass Key" (1931), then a canon нуара именовавшегося gall hard-boiled "cool school".</seg>
<seg id="22">Well or defects.</seg>
<seg id="23">Comics have many dozens of heroes: From 41 морячка Попая пожирателя garlic - giving him a mighty force, Batman and Superman, Dick Tracy to сыскаря by Thor, Spider-Man and other "мстителей."</seg>
<seg id="24">But in any movies based on comic book characters: There was something intrinsically stubbornly unwilling обрастать on-screen flesh remained притворяшками surrounding them willy-nilly in the "real" world.</seg>
<seg id="25">Simply put, they were deprived of "puppy" existence.</seg>
<seg id="26">Нуар, on the other hand, the most existential genre of world literature.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the world wars - with the traditional novel experiences, personalities, family scandals and historical background - has lost all credibility.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Форсайты Тибо Ругон-Маккары, and which even Болконские attended and generally мыслимы after Вердена, of Auschwitz and Hiroshima?</seg>
<seg id="29">The outside world can to do so peacefully the novel format of the soap opera, and criminal - that is, by definition, a novel возвысился marginal to the level of philosophical prose.</seg>
<seg id="30">Hammett in their unfeeling learned that such work санитаром at the front.</seg>
<seg id="31">He was a communist.</seg>
<seg id="32">As, incidentally, were at least close to the Communist Party and such pillars of the genre, writers as Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors are impossibility, Joseph Лоузи, Edward Дмитрик.</seg>
<seg id="33">However нуар archetype, whom they asked, firstly, rude and cynical, and secondly - purely социален.</seg>
<seg id="34">It's almost no American variant of Socialist Realism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The first "City of sins" was remarkable it is that desperate, but seamlessly joined with comic нуаром.</seg>
<seg id="36">For the first time at the screen came alive at this point, the comic isn't all its graphic nature, and never pretended to be "real" film.</seg>
<seg id="37">Darkness sales around the world, where Cardinal leap of murder, but Senator monstrous сына-садиста suit, was entirely worthy of the pen Хэммета.</seg>
<seg id="38">But scenic parts such as heads, which imitated садист декорировал his pen a tune, the genius of James Ellroy, author of "Black orchids" and better - that is stated тошнотворного - Representative неонуара.</seg>
<seg id="39">"The city is not even" грехов-2 retreat, and the capitulation of radical style Миллера--Родригеса localized to tradition.</seg>
<seg id="40">Probably, this was largely due to 3D technology.</seg>
<seg id="41">When watching the second 'City of sins, "feel themselves prisoners in a glass ball, inside which toy клоаку snow falls asleep.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, more often than not it's not the snow, charred and bloody, but by and large, what's the difference?</seg>
<seg id="43">Well how about and say nothing.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to Russian news reports about his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government has stopped fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately started negotiations on the "statehood" отделившегося region.</seg>
<seg id="3">His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later discloses that Putin had in mind to drop hints that восточноукраинская territory controlled by separatists will become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine, should be revised to give русскоговорящему region to defend their rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">But Putin's call for the Government to start negotiations with the very insurgents government-controlled both with equal corresponds to the obvious strategy, which he follows from the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: To help the separatists to take territory and force the Ukrainian government give новопровозглашенной territory Новороссии de facto independence, to closer ties with Russia rather than with the West.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with state television channel First Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return the territory in eastern separatists retained Donetsk and Luhansk regions, both of which were seized in March and April after discharge tend the Ukrainian peninsula Crimea in Moscow on March 18.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists recently called the captured territory Новороссией, or New Russia, the name, which refers to the дореволюционным glory days of the Russian empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin said that anyone who believes that peace talks will occur in the near future, as Ukrainian politicians to campaign for parliamentary elections on October 26, and while government troops attack peace settlements in detained separatists regions, "пленник illusions," ITAR-TASS reported.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We must immediately begin substantive talks and not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the public status of Southeast Ukraine, in order to serve the interests of the people living there," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskov said that Putin's words about statehood had in mind in the context of a broader autonomy that was discussed during months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to allay fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and language rights at risk.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian government could give the eastern regions more autonomy, "said Peskov.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and an internal Ukrainian conflict."</seg>
<seg id="12">Press secretary the Kremlin's intervention to rectify incorrect "interpretation of the words" Putin stressed the decision of the Russian leadership to behave in relation to the breakaway rebellion in the east in any other way than open the seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the population are ethnic Russians 2-миллионного.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would have to withstand much more heavy battle to attach even Donetsk and eastern Ukraine Луганскую area, since most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian, and polls before the start of the conflict, showed broad support for the desire to stay within Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">Autonomy, which Russian diplomats discussed at international forums gave regional governments in the Ukraine would have the power to trade agreements and foreign policy, in effect giving the Kremlin the actual control of the territory, which would be combined with the situation in the territory of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the Black Sea peninsula, присоединенном five months ago, is still the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial marine institutions and historical sea resorts.</seg>
<seg id="16">In regions between Russia's Rostov region and the situation also are mines, mills and casting plants that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.</seg>

<seg id="18">However, his opinion on autonomy, it seems, is very different from the view of the Kremlin and повстанцев-сепаратистов, ranging from which accuse Moscow of aiding and abetting.</seg>
<seg id="19">Last call for Putin to Kiev to negotiate with the leaders of the separatists, with both equal, followed new наступлениями rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks rolled into previously peaceful areas of eastern Ukraine along the Sea of Azov.</seg>
<seg id="20">Russia supported separatists took control of the city in which Новоазовск officers of the Ukrainian security services say they are afraid that he is starting a campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory to the Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="21">This led to a large-scale civilian and military efforts to strengthen their port of Mariupol, with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Новоазовском and narrow on the Crimean peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko on Saturday addressed the meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which has been independent for 23 years.</seg>

<seg id="24">Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukrainian territory.</seg>
<seg id="25">EU summit had not taken certain measures; leaders urged to draw up a project more harsh sanctions against Russia, which will be taken in case of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.</seg>

<seg id="1">Anger turned out to be the most versatile and functional human emotion</seg>
<seg id="2">Сердитое expression is biologically universal for mankind, and everyone involved in its creation of the body and the muscle is not fortuitous, but an additional means of expressing power and threat, scientists have found in Australia and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">About their discovery, they reported in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly, you can read about them in the press release of the University of California in Santa Barbara.</seg>
<seg id="4">Гневное expression - and joined опущенные down eyebrows, lips, the thin line of 2030 nostrils - equally in all cultures, and make it even blind from birth, children are never who saw, said study lead author Aaron Селл.</seg>
<seg id="5">As part of a major research project on the nature of the anger, the scientists found that arose this emotion for the effective conduct of disputes during the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="6">The more physical damage one man can do to another, the greater the opportunity for him to dictate and he pleads to partner with anger.</seg>
<seg id="7">Researchers have found evidence of another of his hypothesis: Physically strong are more likely to get angry and switch to pitch invasions, consider themselves entitled to impose other disadvantageous conditions for them, and they prefer the methods of peaceful conflict resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Starting from that anger is a bargaining emotion "first and foremost," the scientists decided that the movement of each of the seven groups of muscles, creating сердитое expression, should be an individual гневающегося more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor, and thereby force as soon as possible to accept his terms in order to avoid conflict.</seg>
<seg id="9">To test this hypothesis, the researchers modelled on a computer, where absent or provisional Constitution, had each of seven elements гневного faces, and showed their students put forth.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although опущенные eyebrows and chin forward but shutting down discussion simply means the individual did not face evil, then изображенного with such traits of man physically stronger research participants acknowledged unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="11">Anger as human, and with animals, expresses a threat: Exaggerated manifestation of their own strength, force and agree to obey.</seg>
<seg id="12">Man поджимает inflated nostrils and lips with the same goal, and that frog, which надувается or бабуин, which demonstrates their fangs.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Anger" runs "refusal to accept the situation, a friend and immediately takes the form, effectively has demonstrated the opposite side of the consequences of this failure.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the most striking is that none of the components гневного faces is not arbitrary, they are one and the same, "said anthropologist John Туби.</seg>
