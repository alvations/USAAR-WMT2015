<seg id="1">Remembering a very American ideal that labor rights are human rights</seg>
<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have offered the bill, which is protected by the unions as a civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Where unions and middle-class jobs," says Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, who is co-chair of the Congress of Progressive factions.</seg>
<seg id="4">That is why I am proud to represent Act expanding workers ’ rights, together with the symbol of the movement for civil rights by John Lewis.</seg>
<seg id="5">This innovative bill will give workers the same opportunities for legal discrimination against trade union organization, and other forms of discrimination, the stopping power of trade unions</seg>
<seg id="6">The Act regulating labour relations in such a way as to allow the workers encountering discrimination for participation in trade union organizations, to seek justice in the civil courts, and compensation and punitive damages payments - a sensible and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it's certainly not radical initiative - at least by American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the best way to offer that Ellison, Lewis and co-authors of the bill, "recall is a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the attacks, which the unions have in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country, Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, to expand and to respect human rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time, remember, when millions of Americans this country simultaneously defend democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas time MacArthur and his assistants have helped the country to adopt a constitution, to ensure that an autocracy Хидеки Тодзё was replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included text that explicitly admitted that "the right of workers to organize, and for talks, and the collective action is guaranteed."</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Эйзенхауер and his assistants have helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that fascism was replaced by Adolf Hitler a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recognizing that workers will need to be organized and be heard in the new state, the Germans have included an article, which openly stated: "The right to form associations with the aim to protect and improve employment and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict or seek to diminish that right, will have no legal force; measures for these purposes, be declared illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">When the former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which was World Declaration on Human Rights, which in 1948, will be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that "everyone has the right to organize and join unions to protect their interests."</seg>
<seg id="17">Generations of Americans took as its baseline the position that labor rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country advised by other countries about how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans have explained that the right to organize labor unions and "to the union he participated as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - should be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now, when these rights are under assault in America, wisely, really, to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to make their voices heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:</seg>
<seg id="21">History is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has undermined the strength of the nation, but increased them.</seg>
<seg id="23">Raising the living standards of millions, unions miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to fragile level of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack the unions, forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.</seg>
<seg id="25">History remembers as we should.</seg>
<seg id="26">The official recognition of labour rights as human rights and the protection of civil rights, to prevent discrimination against trade union organizations, was long overdue.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the U.S., a federal judge on Sunday temporarily block any introduction to the Louisiana law, which his supporters say he likely will close all five абортных clinics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to this measure, which was signed by the Governor of Louisiana Bobby Джинадлом in June and was supposed to go into effect September 1, doctors who do abortions, were obliged to have powers of patients in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nevertheless, the judge's decision means that, at the moment, doctors can continue to make legal abortion, while continuing to look for such powers.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally, continuing actions to gain power," he wrote in his decision, Judge John деГрэвеллз.</seg>
<seg id="6">The hearing will be scheduled within a month, at which the judge bore a more permanent solution on this law.</seg>
<seg id="7">Abortion rights advocates met with joy at the decision, the latest in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying it will give doctors more time to receive hospital authority.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today's decision ensures that the women will be protected from the League of Louisiana law, which seeks to deprive them of rights and health," said Nancy Нортап, president and head of the Center for reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the state's five clinics.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the decision to the doctors from two clinics, which were claimants in the case, and also filed a request for authority.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, and the courts recently acknowledged such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="11">Key parts of the law that would have closed техасского, most of the remaining clinics in this state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fighters for the right to abortion, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association say that the laws about the credentials of doctors to impose restrictions, which are not necessary from the medical point of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, though some also pointed to positive effect in the closing clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only one doctor who does abortions in Louisiana, is in the hospital, said the Center for reproductive Rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all the other doctors in the state will be forced to stop performing the procedure, the doctor, fearing for their safety, could no longer perform this procedure, the group reported.</seg>
<seg id="16">Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they will not punish doctors doing abortions as long as their statements on the reception waiting for solutions.</seg>

<seg id="1">What will the introduction of quotas for domestic products</seg>
<seg id="2">Not less than half of products for each type of product in the range trading networks should be the Russian production, says Duma deputy from Just Russia, Oleg Nilov.</seg>
<seg id="3">The MP has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures for domestic manufacturers, writes the newspaper Izvestia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The document will still have to avoid possible discomfort детализироваться for buyers.</seg>
<seg id="5">This applies to goods that are produced in Russia. <... > As the rest of the groups of products, which are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to give at least half of the production of their domestic producers, "Nilov told the publication.</seg>
<seg id="6">Together with the amendments to the article "On the basis of state regulation of trading activities in the Russian Federation," the bill provides for the introduction of changes to the Tax Code, laying down railway lines in the VAT rate of 10% of the food produced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea to introduce a 50% quota in -процентную retail chains included in the stimulus package for Russian producers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The shop appears several times more than domestic goods.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the initiative could have both a positive and a negative effect, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the company's lawyer "Налоговик", a member of the independent centre of expertise "Public" Duma Sergei Litvinenko for the Russian economy, as well as for domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive in nature, and will lead to growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">The key will be, farmers, small shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">They will be able to sell more, and that means that profits will grow.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms to retailers and prices, because they will be forced to buy their goods.</seg>
<seg id="14">Russian manufacturers will be able to increase the volume of its sales activities and that will lead to pay higher taxes than before.</seg>
<seg id="15">This will increase budget revenues, will create new jobs, industries will grow any faster would be осваиваться contribution to GDP growth.</seg>
<seg id="16">Russia's dependence on foreign food down several times, though not immediately, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="17">Earlier, Russian companies are often unable to fight their way to the shelves of local shops due to high competition from foreign counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now, after the introduction of an embargo this niche, then emerged and you can breathe a sigh of relief.</seg>
<seg id="19">But do not forget that, after all the necessary approvals and sanitary checks at the Russian market we get food from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="20">In other words, it is now "calm" moment, when the players have already left, and new ones not yet come.</seg>
<seg id="21">Almost a month later, we can talk about the modern demand for Russian raw materials, as well as rising prices for finished products, "said Vice President of АиФ.ru first all-Russian social organization" Russian club financial directors, "Tamara Kasyanov.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clearly, the idea of selling in each category at least 50% of the Russian food products will help to consolidate the sector for local producers.</seg>
<seg id="23">In that case, they will compete with each other, and not with goods that subsidies at the expense of another state, are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="24">In other words, the buyer will unfold between the companies working on one of the industry.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, says Kasyanov, Russian producers can meet 50% of domestic needs compatriots not on all items.</seg>
<seg id="26">And in this situation commercial networks will have to "share" дотягивать Russian goods up to half of the range.</seg>
<seg id="27">In this regard, increasing fears that the shelves were metering products.</seg>
<seg id="28">Perhaps under the guise of manufactured in Russia, will be delivered to foreign products with перебитыми labels, "adds an expert.</seg>
<seg id="29">The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will feel large trading networks, especially those which выгодней cooperate with importers.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is logical that the former prime minister will suffer and foreign suppliers, because the demand for their products will decrease.</seg>
<seg id="31">Litvinenko did not rule out that the law on quotas on domestic goods may impact on consumers.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fact is that some of the Russian-made products can yield quality imported ones, while shops will be boosting prices on the second as a scarce commodity.</seg>
<seg id="33">In the early 2000s the long-forgotten import substitution idea economists started talking again in February this year because of the ongoing devaluation of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="34">Now, against the background of difficult relations with the West, the question of the import of products becomes even more urgent.</seg>
<seg id="35">The law is designed to oblige suppliers to retailers under orders from domestic producers.</seg>
<seg id="36">Then we are much faster and more confident we will go the way of import substitution, and the planning system to produce the necessary products in a shorter period of time, "says the MP Oleg Nilov.</seg>
<seg id="37">Especially effective mechanism for those quotas will be agricultural sectors, where the potential is especially high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.</seg>
<seg id="38">Our farmers are able to fully cover the shelves in Russian shops.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition, a powerful impulse can receive and uranium production.</seg>
<seg id="40">As is known, the biggest share of imports is saved for its beef - from 30% to 35%.</seg>
<seg id="41">It turns out, the momentum is still on Russian products, "says Kasyanov.</seg>

<seg id="1">Inflation came out of the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="2">Whether the Russians feel the sharp rise in prices</seg>
<seg id="3">As a result, twisted the Russian sanctions and the inflation in Russia but not in forecasts and уложится authorities, analysts believe, "VTB Capital."</seg>
<seg id="4">According to experts, the deferred effects антисанкций will lead to inflationary ever in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the latest forecast, issued in 2014, inflation will be 6,5-7,5% next year and to less than 6.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to the newspaper, "Kommersant," the ministry this week should make a "small but significant" changes in macroeconomic forecast up to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the publication, the agency ’ s assessment of inflation in 2015, which will eliminate progeSOFT expected revenue growth of the population.</seg>
<seg id="8">In food, it was assumed that the Russian sanctions are a year - until August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">In such a situation would be to assume such high inflation?</seg>
<seg id="10">The current situation involves onetime shock, but понижательный inflation trend will not change, "said the source of the newspapers in all.</seg>
<seg id="11">Economists from VTB Capital "do not share the economic bloc's expectations regarding inflation and the forecast price growth in 2014 at the level of 8%.</seg>
<seg id="12">The main effect of product bans will come together with the introduction of the sales tax (GAP) in 2015, experts believe.</seg>
<seg id="13">Could peak at 9 per cent in February, after which the annual pace of price growth will decline, some experts believe.</seg>
<seg id="14">By the way, last week let Rosstat first inflation results, after Russia imposed sanctions "neat".</seg>
<seg id="15">АиФ.ru interviewed experts and found their inflationary expectations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Artem Деев, head of research at FC AForex:</seg>
<seg id="17">Price growth is already the main segments of goods.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moreover, when I began to appreciate the socially significant products, the government has been forced to launch measures of monitoring systemic risks to price stability, in order to prevent unreasonable price increases in the short term.</seg>
<seg id="19">Suppliers and retailers report is already on a daily basis before regulators that authorities knew exactly who was where and for what reason will trigger an increase in prices.</seg>
<seg id="20">The key consumer price index growth continues to be tremendous pace of capital flight, excessive refinancing the banking sector from the Russian мегарегулятора, converting on an internal flight in foreign currency, as well as an embargo on the import of food from countries that joined the sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="21">If inflationary pressures remained under control, the cost of a minimum basket of products not jumped to 12 per cent in just one quarter.</seg>
<seg id="22">A ban on the import of food products provoked shock proposals on the internal market and led to a higher final cost логичному.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because at this stage we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, and increase self-sufficiency of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production, sanctions will continue to be the growth component of the inflationary risks.</seg>
<seg id="24">If you include another and fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as ухудшенными prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year, inflation could exceed 8%.</seg>
<seg id="25">Alexander Разуваев, director of the analytical department of Alpari. ""</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 1990s inflation reached sometimes 20-30% per month to zero, it was also higher than the current level, another thing that then it is offset by rapid economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="27">I think, at the end of the year inflation will be 8-8,5%.</seg>
<seg id="28">Plato Магута, managing assets of the Criminal Code, "the Fund Магута"</seg>
<seg id="29">An external factor associated with sanctions against Russia, while successfully contained, but if there is a further increase of the pressure, first of all, the financial sector - this can lead to a certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations, which are traditionally purchases in cash currency to protect their savings.</seg>
<seg id="30">It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance will try to smooth the weakening rouble, as market practices and government regulation.</seg>
<seg id="31">But prices traditionally begins after a lull over the summer and, possibly, this fall will become more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="32">The target level of consumer inflation in Russia, 7.5%, most likely, because Russian выстоит has another dividend.</seg>

<seg id="18">The engineering industry center deputy director of capital construction Vladimir Rosatom Малахов drew attention to the fact that the market can be divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and the companies who own outsourced competence and not allowing the field of competitors.</seg>
<seg id="19">He believes that the creation of a transparent market is only possible when access to contracts will be maximum огражден from someone's manager.</seg>
<seg id="20">Experts on the council was asked to form a government in such a way that one and the same performer may not receive more than one contract for more than $1 billion or more contracts for more than $1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="21">In минстрое believe that this approach must be evaluated from the point of view of the business impact, and effectiveness of construction management.</seg>
<seg id="22">As explained by Elena Zhukova, in this case, you will need to endow the general functions, which will lead to an increase of the budget and spending on its content.</seg>
<seg id="23">The customer will need to have the knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by contractors, as well as their safety.</seg>
<seg id="24">Often with such a result, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the security of an object as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of highly skilled participants in connection with the state in obtaining state indeed order for part-time work and a small amount of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="26">The deputy head of the Institute of procurement экспертно-консультационного Евсташенков Alexander believes that now the government has turned into a business to Scor contractor.</seg>
<seg id="27">And this example: "A participant while completing application must specify" specific performance "without the words" or equivalent "," should "," "," "more," "less than," "similar" "or", "type", "type", not a "lower," "lower," "higher," "can," "may," "might," "earlier", "not", not "higher," "not allowed" and so on.</seg>
<seg id="28">Thus, customers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of applications, poisoning contractors.</seg>
<seg id="29">Another problem, according to 44-ФЗ Евсташенкова, was the need to assess the application of the "paper" proposal.</seg>
<seg id="30">Considering the application, you can really only assess a qualified contractor, but not the quality of the works, to which not even began, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="31">The quality of the works can be assessed only on their acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="32">The experts also were asked to take a margin on income from the upper echelon to have disappeared in the lower intermediate contractors.</seg>
<seg id="33">Chairman of the Expert Council, State Secretary, espionage FAS Andrei Цариковский believes that it is not worth it, as responsible for the order should генподрядчик.</seg>
<seg id="34">But otherwise, as in the famous репризе of Arkady Raikin normalises sleeping: "Пуговицам claims to have?"</seg>

<seg id="3">The house was built in the 18th century is not changed, if not considered ветхость.</seg>
<seg id="4">Strangers here, as people go on tour, and residents are more than delighted, from his privilege - the right to live in the house, the walls of which took Ufa remember leader Alexander Suvorov.</seg>
<seg id="5">The date of construction of the house, amongst others, historians point to the two dates - 1730 and 1737.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in any case, it turns out that the nearly 300 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The old yard, always open the door, the squeaky staircase.</seg>
<seg id="8">The doors in the apartments are located near each other, the chair covers were cracked and peeling plaster просветы places visible from the street.</seg>
<seg id="9">It seems all the honest word.</seg>
<seg id="10">But local residents are told: "You don't think it is."</seg>
<seg id="11">Live in a wooden house of the 18th century is very difficult, "says Tatiana Karimov, a resident of apartment # 3.</seg>
<seg id="12">The object is to госохране, but its content has not allocated the money for dozens of years, and we feel museum exhibits, about which the authorities simply have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">The last renovation was 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The wall even though with great difficulties, but the foundation of the entire прогнил.</seg>
<seg id="15">Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, and the game once a week in a public bath.</seg>
<seg id="16">How can you be content in such conditions?</seg>
<seg id="17">The road passes directly under the windows, even the pedestrian zone.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tatiana dented curtain.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now you can see what before was only heard: It is under the windows of the cars.</seg>
<seg id="20">You see, open windows, glass дребезжат constantly, and can't get used to the noise.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a man gets used to everything, the good and the bad.</seg>
<seg id="22">Our apartment still top, thanks to her husband, he has golden hands.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, two of the three of us, we have to live with her son.</seg>
<seg id="24">And other families have much worse conditions, on the second floor ceiling at a little more than one and a half metres tall.</seg>
<seg id="25">In contrast to Tatiana offers guests the roommate out of the apartment, No. 6 Lyudmila Старостиной.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nice friendly woman with a cup of coffee and with a sad smile said:</seg>
<seg id="27">We have a one-bedroom apartment, 14.5 m ² for four people, and we live with my husband and daughter, with her granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="28">I am here with the birth, another boundary was not never, "Lyudmila обводит eyes room: You're buying two sofas, the letter" g "; one of them was the granddaughter with a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="29">Very closely and differs little from a domestic interior: Only ceilings, beautiful "historic."</seg>
<seg id="30">But with ceiling tap system regularly flows: Not good.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lyudmila said of his apartment and at the same time, as it routinely trends, the house which stands on the Roman ruins.</seg>
<seg id="32">It brings in a very old one, and the recent, everyday and legendary:</seg>
<seg id="33">Water spent about 40 years ago during the last repair.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the same time, we have a small kitchen and bathroom in закутке from former чулана.</seg>
<seg id="35">We live in a time where квартировал Demidov family, lived on the second floor of the servants.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our apartment is privatised, and why?</seg>
<seg id="37">In Ufa, say real estate, the privatization of meaning.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still only get apartment, can't apply for more.</seg>
<seg id="39">Already four months ago promised us расселить further promises, but it did not matter.</seg>
<seg id="40">Not used and will not complain.</seg>
<seg id="41">In this apartment (room!) lived a whole dynasty: My grandparents, Mom and Dad, I'm with my husband and my daughter, with her granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="42">Things happened during that time.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, здоровенные rats ran in the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="44">Look at the walls of the outhouses, they one-meter wide thickness.</seg>
<seg id="45">The solution, they say was involved in eggs, so long rests.</seg>
<seg id="46">The house built thoroughly Демидовым, thank you!</seg>
<seg id="47">Perhaps, but so far no one killed a crumbling battlement сваей or ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="48">Only construction still slowly dying on the eyes: Boards and log house гниют floors, we have repeatedly failed, pouring cement, all but useless - solution goes into the ground, as well.</seg>
<seg id="49">They say and have, under our room the concealed лаз and move to the river White, who had once lived in the old Believers, so that you can hide from danger, in which case.</seg>
<seg id="50">Persecuted them.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lyudmila Stappel tells how it came some historian, pleaded to let in the apartment he began excavations.</seg>
<seg id="52">And then urged to give them housing space in exchange for its однушку prospectus in October.</seg>
<seg id="53">Lyudmila be refused:</seg>
<seg id="54">Where are we in однушку вчетвером?</seg>
<seg id="55">And here at least a tiny hope is that will give housing more spacious.</seg>
<seg id="56">We agree on the exchange, nothing would not have won.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, the family Старостиных won nothing.</seg>
<seg id="58">The biggest dream Ludmila, Suburban Region, and one 16-year-old daughter with her granddaughter gave a separate room.</seg>
<seg id="59">The two families have identified two-room apartment instead of the majestic ruins, in which two generations living now.</seg>
<seg id="60">Pretty girl, миниатюрная Olesya Карсакова flats from No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.</seg>
<seg id="61">In two cramped squeezed into airless apartments with a total area of 23 m ², called apartments, lives with her large family.</seg>
<seg id="62">We just seven people, two of them children.</seg>
<seg id="63">See for yourself what conditions.</seg>
<seg id="64">Your butt falls off pieces of plaster and window frames, the walls in the kitchen, and the cross-cutting holes.</seg>
<seg id="65">The water in the кране only cold all year.</seg>
<seg id="66">Walking about the house, the old apartments, you can see that the more fortunate of all spouses Lavrentyev apartment No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="67">They occupy the most spacious rooms of the first floor.</seg>
<seg id="68">You are right, a lot of places.</seg>
<seg id="69">The 75 square, directed three people.</seg>
<seg id="70">We live in those rooms, where legend has it stopped the police during his stay in Ufa, the head of the family, "said Aleksandr Dmitrievich Lavrentyev.</seg>
<seg id="71">High ceilings, spacious.</seg>
<seg id="72">One bad - all around the train wreck that is coming apart at the seams, crumbles.</seg>
<seg id="73">Neighbors probably already told.</seg>
<seg id="74">The more suffering we have with floors, wooden planks сгнили, literally walked out from under the feet of the ground.</seg>
<seg id="75">I put подпорки wedges, anything in the hall; and, in another room, but on a seesaw squads, so all you can.</seg>
<seg id="76">The merchant house Евдокима Демидова Aleksandr Dmitrievich can tell you better than any guide.</seg>
<seg id="77">Золотопромышленнику refers to as to native, speaks of it with admiration.</seg>
<seg id="78">Indeed, the personality and the owner was fantastic: Кагинского Узянского plants built houses, отливал guns and bells, kept Ural mines.</seg>
<seg id="79">Merchants take pride in an ancestor of real estate heirs, but live under one roof with history no longer want.</seg>
<seg id="80">I lived here as a kid, in the 1940s, in the 20th century, "said Aleksandr Dmitrievich.</seg>
<seg id="81">Then around stood there for wooden buildings, stables and sentry boxes, subsequently снесенные.</seg>
<seg id="82">In 1968, and wanted to clean our house, but something prevented.</seg>
<seg id="83">Later in 2014: Again поманили new housing.</seg>
<seg id="84">We, as the team gathered all the necessary documents, обегали instance, and suddenly learned that moving to an apartment in 2015 or 2016.</seg>
<seg id="85">Something already doesn't believe in all this....</seg>
<seg id="86">Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan, to learn the fate of their homes.</seg>
<seg id="87">Officials of the occupier was not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="88">Sent from one desk to another, but then, as mockery, given without printing and paper signatures: "The Ministry of Culture is not objecting to the resettlement of tenants."</seg>
<seg id="89">Even I have a feeling that our house is not in terms of the city, because he was under the number 57, then became 57 A, now 57 / 1.</seg>
<seg id="90">As if he had already been demolished in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="91">"A planet" to the management of the sector, the head of Project Support for Ufa Vladimir Барабашу.</seg>
<seg id="92">A house on the street of the October Revolution 57 / 1 is included in the program of settling the old housing.</seg>
<seg id="93">I can't be responsible for the actions of officials in the 1970s, only know that at the time there was a plan for the demolition of all old houses, despite the historical significance.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the authorities is to rebuild the old house on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value, "successfully.</seg>
<seg id="95">Tenants soon расселить planned for new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="96">According to Барабаша, restore Демидова House will be Italian experts who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="97">Italy is now in the Biennale, and architectural project "Old Ufa is there" among others.</seg>
<seg id="98">I hope that by 2016 all former Old Street will be on best Western Hotel Tigra was renovated, "said the official.</seg>
<seg id="99">The house will order, that was before, three centuries ago.</seg>
<seg id="100">Демидова house, is likely to become a museum, open to all comers.</seg>
<seg id="101">In addition, the government decided to make pedestrian street at the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="102">On weekdays, unfortunately, don't get too much workload of roads in the city.</seg>
<seg id="103">People from the future museum расселить Vladimir Барабаш promises in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="104">However, it is unlikely that they will be: Their new apartments will be of the same area, and that the current.</seg>
<seg id="105">Only from another era.</seg>

<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mix of total and rap, and melodies - жизнерадостны.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Henry had to get through some difficult memories of childhood.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the death of his mother was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often mused about the relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was very inaccessible.</seg>
<seg id="10">You never saw his face, you only hear his voice: "Don't make noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Отстань from sisters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Шевелись!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch the cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were older, when I was a child, walked with him in the pub and talk about these things, as a form of beer glasses, the beauty of the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">I never talked to him or not.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was the guy in the corner неулыбчивым, who read the newspaper a large part of my life.</seg>
<seg id="17">Henry recently opened the studio are in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in the days of his father, he was able to look at what must have been his life.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now there's a little bit better, but it is deep, dark, дымные labyrinths' full extent of Hell with outbreaks of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father залезал in a bathtub and just lay there, and you have heard, as he slowly begins to sing to myself, because he wanted the отмыться mould from the studio.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I came back, I realised that he was doing it years and years to earn us a female, and I began to appreciate it more.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nevertheless, Henry came out of childhood devoid of parental love.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never hugged, never say, "I love you."</seg>
<seg id="23">Only when her mother became ill at the end of her life, we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you.</seg>
<seg id="24">The birth of her own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love with which he lacked as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">You can stop it, "I love you"?</seg>
<seg id="26">Just don't hug me!</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I'm 22!</seg>
<seg id="28">With Dawn French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why would I not be friends with her?</seg>
<seg id="30">She's a great mother</seg>

<seg id="36">He was the one that killed her.</seg>
<seg id="37">So, when I was very, very recovered and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to take radical measures.</seg>

<seg id="39">It's very hard.</seg>
<seg id="40">And that's boring.</seg>
<seg id="41">No one eats carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">A change of career trajectories of Henry reflected, perhaps, in his noble, briefly подстриженной beard.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he received the recognition for his critics of Othello, he completely immersed in theatre.</seg>

<seg id="45">This work is different from sitcoms and comedies that were неотъемлимым attribute his busy professional life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He began his career, when he was 16 and worked in a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">DJ noticed, as he parodies on the stage, and wrote about it in "The new faces."</seg>
<seg id="48">His career in television began in the mid seventies: "Quite a long time I was the only black пародистом / first on television."</seg>
<seg id="49">He studied at work.</seg>
<seg id="50">I not only had to grow in the eyes of the public, I had to learn how to be an efficient vehicle for the delivery of jokes between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working in television, and it was very hard.</seg>
<seg id="51">Temperatures in the "New faces" in 1975</seg>
<seg id="52">As his manager had to show "Black and white minstrels," light entertainment program, in which people face, "" чернили Henry found that is in it for five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">My family is a very disliked.</seg>
<seg id="54">I, like, hopefully, this will never be with me, but I don't regret that I did it.</seg>
<seg id="55">Though it was a strange, worthy of condemnation, I worked on large venues and learned to work the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="56">But what was "which rewards light entertainment on British television classics for years and years," and it was "bizarre to black people."</seg>
<seg id="57">Introducing characters who were black culture in the UK, and her perfume, Henry worked in alternative комедийном project in the 1980s.</seg>

<seg id="60">Next was a series of documentary broadcasts on Radio 4 called "What good...?"</seg>

<seg id="94">Amounts to pointless head?</seg>
<seg id="95">They would have shown her blunt fist, if she was not cautious.</seg>
<seg id="96">Would be first kissed, kiss now became the most common erotic expression of irritation between a man and a woman; an antidote from fresh ballads, too, which Google is the first to kiss her, and then hit.</seg>
<seg id="97">Excessive clarification, according to Кеверна because the kiss itself was already хулиганством.</seg>
<seg id="98">Эйлинн Соломонз case showed that he needs to leave.</seg>
<seg id="99">He rose from the sun loungers, as an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She herself felt the lead weight, but the weight of his grief surprised her.</seg>
<seg id="101">It was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They barely knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">She looked, as he goes from an upper window and looked, as he was leaving, her companion, the man himself to endure взваливший.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam, outgoing, she thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">She felt a stab of sympathy towards him and men in general, even though some of them and raised her hand.</seg>
<seg id="106">The man, from the pulpit, with отвернувшийся back пристыженный сраженный, the ability to fight left him - why it seemed to her that she knew it so well, if she could not recall a single case, until today, when she saw it?</seg>
<seg id="107">Again one Эйлинн Соломонз looked at their feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">For twenty years before the events described above or so Esme cantered Нуссбаум, an intelligent and energetic 32-летняя исследовательница, which worked in "Офнау," an informal service that control mood, has prepared a report on the low and medium levels of violence in most parts of the country, where it was expected that it will be reduced, if not stopped entirely, given the means and the forces that were in its eradication.</seg>
<seg id="109">"A lot has been done, and a lot is being done," she wrote, "to mitigate the innate aggressiveness of people who fought in a war and won most of them, especially among these спутанных branches and narrow расселин area, where, despite saw изгородями spires of churches above, gentle breath of human kindness was rarely in history.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, some quality, it turns out, неискоренимы.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher, it would seem, the низменнее those passions that he зарождает.</seg>
<seg id="112">The sheds tears over the sentimental stories about drinking, skipping преодоленных obstacles and announces its overheated belief in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness retains its firm grip in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is evidence that a new depth and vile задиристость in homes, in the workplace, on roads and even in playgrounds.</seg>
<seg id="113">"You have досадная habit of writing too much," said her supervisor, read the report as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="114">It seems to me that you should read shorter novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">Esme cantered Нуссбаум lowered her head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask you: You атеистка?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I think that is not obliged to answer," said Esme cantered Нуссбаум.</seg>
<seg id="118">You lesbian?</seg>
<seg id="119">Esme cantered again insisted on his right to privacy and silence.</seg>
<seg id="120">Feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Again silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I ask," said Luther Рабиновиц, "not because I am against atheism, лесбийства or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">Here we have no prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="124">We are the servants of society without prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="125">But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely reasonable and a good in themselves, they may sometimes distort the results, such as those that you have shown me.</seg>
<seg id="126">It is obvious that you yourself предубеждены against the church, and what you call "vicious" and "brutal," others would be interpreted as an expression of natural healthy and intensity.</seg>
<seg id="127">Continue нудеть CONTRACT about THAT IF ВООБЩЕ happened, happened, as if it had happened, if at all, has happened yesterday, it means depriving the country needed her life force.</seg>
<seg id="128">Esme cantered Нуссбаум огляделась around until Рабиновиц said.</seg>
<seg id="129">In his head, like a pink No. LED letters repeated advice that "Офнау" gave the country a quarter of a century or more.</seg>
<seg id="130">His energy, his neighbour улыбайся spouse, listen to organise the ballads, walk, talk on the phone, talk, listen, this fairytale, соглашайся, извиняйся.</seg>
<seg id="131">The conversation is better than silence, word of the song better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I fully understand that you want to say," answered quietly when Esme cantered Нуссбаум is satisfied that her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I don't want to say nothing, except that he was not as effective as we convince ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">I am concerned that if we do not, we will find that repeat mistakes that initially led to ТОМУ ВООБЩЕ IF THAT happened, happened.</seg>
<seg id="134">Only this time, we are not throwing their anger and distrust the other.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Рабиновиц joined his sitting in.</seg>
<seg id="136">That gesture was supposed to mean an infinite patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"You go too far," he said, calling the actions "" errors "that made or not made our grandfathers.</seg>
<seg id="138">You go too far and when talking about what they threw away their "anger" and "mistrust" in the "other."</seg>
<seg id="139">In your place, people should not need always to remind that the understanding of the past, it is currently defending, we're not talking about "us" and "them."</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "us" and no "other."</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of turmoil - that's about all we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"For that, to be honest with ourselves," ventured into Esme cantered, "neither part of society may well justify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am not accusing anyone.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether this was good or bad, what is done is done.</seg>
<seg id="145">Then it was back then.</seg>
<seg id="146">No need to say anything more - here we agree.</seg>
<seg id="147">And how not to blame anybody, we should not make excuses and, if that was appropriate, or if there was something you can fix.</seg>
<seg id="148">But why, if not to learn "</seg>
<seg id="149">Past Update to ensure that we have forgotten it.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I can add to that one word -</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther's Great Pyramid Рабиновица collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I'll review your report", he said, by letting go of her.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, on the way to work, she knocked off a biker who rode on the sidewalk, passersby, described as "a vicious rage."</seg>

<seg id="2">Manufacturing growth in the eurozone slowed to the lowest figure in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.</seg>
<seg id="3">The business index (PMI) for the eurozone manufacturing sector public fell to 50.7 in August, dropping from 51.8 in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">The above 50 indicates growth.</seg>
<seg id="5">New orders and business opportunity, suffered among the growing tension between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The meeting came before the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Markets will wait for the bank from a clear plan of how to cope with a recovery in the eurozone, as well as the threat of deflation, with inflation of just 0.3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi later this week may give further signals that he is contemplating the contagion in the eurozone, similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Although some growth is better than no growth, and the braking effect of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty for manufacturers is becoming more obvious," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at public.</seg>
<seg id="10">The manufacturing sector PMI in Germany, a major trade partner of Russia in the EU, has fallen to the lowest level in 11 months of 51.4.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the meantime, the bloc's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.</seg>

<seg id="14">The slowdown in the industry, most likely, would add fuel to the fire, analysts are anticipating the introduction of additional monetary or tax-based fiscal stimulus.</seg>
<seg id="15">One positive was news from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.</seg>
<seg id="16">What Howard, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that can be said about the August survey index of business activity in the eurozone manufacturing sector, is that it shows that the sector is still growing."</seg>
<seg id="17">He added: "Eurozone manufacturers, obviously, are finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension - particularly the Ukraine / Russia adds uncertainty still difficult conditions in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">This increasing tension, apparently hit by business - and especially the confidence of consumers, and is likely to lead to the fact that some orders are delayed, or even cancelled, especially large orders.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said that "increasingly likely" that the ECB, of course, in the end, will have to conduct some sort of contagion, although "we suspect that it will be limited."</seg>

<seg id="66">In London, people cried when I told our story.</seg>

<seg id="68">She was grateful to "Sheri Blair for the fund and its award and the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="69">I would like to call her the Sheri and simply say that 10 years have passed, but I still remember a meeting with her and her husband in London and how they helped Дамиру and me.</seg>

<seg id="74">She said: "I think that this world was no better over these 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="75">Now in Ukraine there is a war, people are dying every day, and I think many children have been killed or be killed.</seg>
<seg id="76">It's just the same as our children.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think for many people, war is a news broadcast, that they listen to when they get bored or when they are preoccupied with something else.</seg>
<seg id="78">I just know that these people feel, the horror of it.</seg>
<seg id="79">And I can't stop feeling it.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it is so sad.</seg>
<seg id="81">Damir grew up and became very soft and quiet as a boy, he's not an aggressive and angry.</seg>
<seg id="82">He is not looking for revenge, for example, he did not just fixed on it in this last nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not like to remember it, but they are very close with six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and burn candles there.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was younger, he suffered from this, I remember, as he lay on the couch, facing away from us, for hours.</seg>
<seg id="85">Not slept, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys. Дамиру now 17, he was above me, nice, smart and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">To me it is hard to believe that a few hours I was so sure that he is dead and that I never see him no more.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I managed to recover from the explosion and rose to his feet, I огляделась hell, I saw around me, when parts of bodies were lying everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely convinced that it is not possible to my little boy could survive in this hell.</seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember what I shouted to him:" Run, Damir, убегай ", but again I was so sure that he had not heard me.</seg>
<seg id="91">But he heard, and ran off.</seg>
<seg id="92">So life goes on for us, unlike so many others.</seg>

<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing in such pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need to have a little bit of tens of years to forget it.</seg>
<seg id="121">It has affected my health, and I still feel it.</seg>
<seg id="122">About three or four years, I had nightmares because of the seizure, but now it became better.</seg>
<seg id="123">I returned to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.</seg>
<seg id="124">I thought about my friends and the only that had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="125">That's why I continue to walk in the gym before every September 1.</seg>
<seg id="126">I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.</seg>
<seg id="127">I find it difficult to enter the gym, but I must do this.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips, how to achieve a better quality photos and video underwater</seg>
<seg id="2">If you want to take photos or shoot video under the water in front of you, a whole range of options.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option, is a waterproof "Shoot," for example, the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or, for example, GoPro Hero3 экшн-камера + Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I took these pictures on a family holiday with the help of several cameras, all for the price of about $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">No matter what equipment you are using, you need to comply with several regulations, in order to achieve the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Перепроверяйте their equipment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera case and other branches of the tightly closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, set up their camera for the type of photos or videos that you shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some cameras and camcorders are shooting modes or object type, which must review for затемненных underwater conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in the water, find out how deep your equipment can fall.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are designed only to 5 feet, the other 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Look at our leadership and the ratings of digital cameras for both traditional and catalog models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Remove a few frames - because many of them don't, you'll get.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Мыльниц" have LCD that can help you take, then assign them as экшн-камер usually are not.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have LCD, it will be difficult to see under the water, and the layout of the frame is a random process.</seg>
<seg id="16">So do a few frames.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also, if you have a camera mode that takes several shots with a slightly different view, use them.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">The amount of light is significantly reduced, the deeper you нырнете under water.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, stay at the surface, when you're shooting in the pool, the river or the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">It will also allow you to transfer more colors in the photos; the deeper you can color, the fewer you'll see.</seg>
<seg id="22">Подплывайте closer to objects.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is excellent advice for shooting on the land, but it is even more important under the water because затемненных light conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is important, especially if you're shooting on экшн-камеру: This equipment often comes with a fixed, широкоугольной lens, which means that you have to get closer to shooting facilities, if you want to fill the frame.</seg>

<seg id="2">Консультирующий anaesthetist, he has devoted his career as deliverance of patients suffering from the disease, and from such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among those who spoke to him, recalls his wife, was the officer Hemer, who had to live with devastating effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that as long as doctors are being diagnosed and diseases, those who are being treated, mainly worried about something else -- the pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, however, he appeared to those who suffer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I did not feel, as usual," he wrote in May last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">For me it was hard to find in themselves the strength.</seg>
<seg id="8">Struggling with symptoms similar to flu, he found that his wife, Juliet reproaches irritably.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want everything to happen sooner rather than later," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Juliet left for the week, Lawson found that unusual and it is not clear why he was upset.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked a colleague to chest X-rays.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks before he went skiing in the Alps lead.</seg>
<seg id="14">The results of the X-rays came.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was mesothelioma, a terminal cancer, which affects плевру shell, or lungs.</seg>
<seg id="16">For most cancers, it is difficult to determine an exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although some people get sick of lung cancer, for example, not all cancer patients smoking lung.</seg>
<seg id="18">But with attributable to mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases the cause is contact with asbestos, grainy, construction material, who once called the "miracle," but which, as we now know, mortally dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us is disease mesothelioma, which you can't pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos, in the end, is the stuff from the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in the UK since the 1960s, when these industrial ban came into force.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even when it has been used, only people from specific sectors worked in close contact with him: Трубоизолировщики, builders, carpenters and computers, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">Industrial toxin from another era, he is hardly cause for concern today.</seg>
<seg id="25">But such a calm erroneously.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it turns out, is now at the peak of the epidemic мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="27">Here мезотелиомы dies from more people than in any other country on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="28">The annual death rate at about 2500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease than as a result of road accidents.</seg>
<seg id="29">The annual number of deaths from мезотелиомы since 1980 and projected the number of deaths in the UK in the future</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason we feel its deadly consequences right now, lies in the fact that, although the use of asbestos it is illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), for the development of мезотелиомы go usually tens of years.</seg>
<seg id="31">And attack мезотелиомы veterans is not limited to industrial construction specialties.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was and, in many cases, remains in the house where we live, where we work, offices, schools, shops, where we are and where we go shopping.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result of mesothelioma, does not pay attention in class, profession, income level or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">Избранности bastions of fashionable London department stores, before the private schools, as it turned out, not salvation.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parliament building is riddled with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even hospitals that are meant to treat us, reservoirs were fatal, a carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was not трубоизолировщиком.</seg>
<seg id="39">In fact, he had to think where he might have come into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he realized.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It seems that there could be a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's hospital, where I spent six years on it," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">All are students, nurses, doctors, and by chance - used these тоннелями.</seg>
<seg id="43">I wonder how many of my peers expect the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">This was a question to which, unfortunately, he was able to give a partial response.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Of the four doctors, which we in the hospital and Guy have subsequently developed mesothelioma for the past five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I alone remained alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us expect this disease?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Лоусону was diagnosed with mesothelioma, "" when he was 48 years old.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">Live so long is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty percent attributable to mesothelioma patients die within 8 months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is always fatal.</seg>
<seg id="52">Thus, we can now only repeat Лоусона question: "How many of us expect the same disease?"</seg>
<seg id="53">According to a leading expert on type in the UK, Professor Джулиану Пито, most likely to assume that the years between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain should an himself, hardworking people about to die.</seg>
<seg id="54">Now most are not, and that will die in this way.</seg>
<seg id="55">Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada, with</seg>
<seg id="56">A quick review of reports from the halls of the court, where victims are often seek compensation, shows how far it has spread attack мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="57">In June, for example, Marks & Spencer, admitted that the three Джэнис Ellen contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, wildfires clothing departments at two sites, one of which was the store on Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs Ellen was only 18 years old, when she started working at M & S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now her two children more than 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Before this happened," she says, "I had never heard about the type, I barely knew about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="62">And in my head I could not come to me that this will affect.</seg>
<seg id="63">Few people really know a lot about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="64">In fact, asbestos is not one substance, and a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">They get their name from the word "асбестиформ", which means the fibrous structure, which tells them the strength and flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="66">Of those six, three were often used in the construction.</seg>
<seg id="67">Widely known as chrysotile, or white asbestos, is often found in other buildings today.</seg>
<seg id="68">It has been used in roofing panels, напольной, thermal insulation, boiler pipes, brake колодках even in cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">He смертелен less than other forms of asbestos, but the World Health Organization and the European Union as "a source of serious health damage," which can lead to death.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, brown and blue asbestos (амозит крокидолит (asbestos).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that "there are good, though indirect, and reason to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with attributable to mesothelioma [in the UK]."</seg>
<seg id="72">Employee Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the main store on Oxford Street, with London</seg>
<seg id="73">Джэнис Ellen may not have thought of themselves as a victim, but Julian Пито мезотелиомы work suggests that her story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that "a significant percentage of мезотелиом when there is no known exposure at work or at home, were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment."</seg>
<seg id="75">Much of this impact, he says, is "regular" and the weather impact on our building.</seg>
<seg id="76">No one, it seems, can't be sure that he is safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">The report Goddard Consulting, which was in the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the heart of the government, could be exposed to unconsciously.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009, Goddard said that technical mines and pipelines for the premises of parliamentary committees were infected with deadly asbestos fibres, which may be given in the movement, something so harmless as "strong currents of air."</seg>
<seg id="79">Members of the parliament often blame the fact that they are pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.</seg>
<seg id="80">Although for maintenance of Parliament insisted that Westminster Palace received a "clean bill of health now," she acknowledged that it is necessary to work on the £1 billion for the reconstruction of the parliament, by upgrading electrician and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, members of parliament, will meet in the conference centre close to innovation, and not on the green benches optimization.</seg>
<seg id="81">Goddard report noted that "the situation with the asbestos was not in accordance with the various rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">It is impossible to know whether this error management cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All we can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">One of those who failed to identify his contact with asbestos, is Graham moment, general practitioner.</seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson, the moment, 50 years, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I worked in a hospital, which successfully brought claims associated with asbestos," he says, "But I can't prove this in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It's so hard to remember all the places where he worked, and the date.</seg>
<seg id="88">He clearly remembers that day in early December 2009, when his wholly overcame something that was like the flu.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly were shaken as me.</seg>
<seg id="91">It started very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terrible.</seg>
<seg id="93">I thought I can't drive all the way to homes.</seg>
<seg id="94">Being a doctor, knew that the moment the pain comes from, including checking for iframe loads, wrapping around the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="95">However, like Джэнис Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect мезотелиому.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the end, he could not walk to work a month.</seg>
<seg id="97">US doctors doing chest x-rays and put плевральные катетеры to pull fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis.</seg>
<seg id="98">And yet his condition оставлось without a diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">Gradually, his health has improved, and he returned to work.</seg>
<seg id="100">But from time to time the same symptoms return, often after he was involved in sport, and he breathed heavily.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, one of the patients Эбботта came to him in office with similar symptoms, and he was later diagnosed with mesothelioma. ""</seg>
<seg id="102">Even then, however, the moment it is not associated with their own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">In the end, it was the patient for dozens of years older and worked directly with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">In this case, the connection was obvious.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011 the Эбботта deteriorated again, and listened to his doctor showed him the results of x-rays and CT experts group.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, exactly two years after the moment began to feel ill, the sensor, equipped with a camera, was introduced into his chest cavity between the shell, and the shell of his lung.</seg>
<seg id="107">I'm an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I usually just go further, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="109">I'm not too upset about it, to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="110">But my wife, Rachel, has experienced.</seg>
<seg id="111">Biopsy results came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham moment mesothelioma diagnosis:</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly the moment sank in meetings with Macmillan nurses, one of which suggested he contact a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">It was then he realised the scale of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turns out that asbestos was commonly used, especially in large public buildings, and where quite often there was asbestos thermal insulation systems on the planet," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, now get sick with this disease.</seg>
<seg id="117">Thus, mesothelioma now affects more young people, atypical professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous asbestos pipes isolated in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees, who were the tunnels connecting nearby landmasses can bring together, to get from one building to another (as Andrew Lawson), or eat in canteens in basements (how often did Graham moment) almost certainly really were exposed to toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">For several decades after the war, as it turns out, the hospital was a place where, in theory, pulled for life, but a place that поциентов constituted a threat to life for doctors who treated them.</seg>
<seg id="121">It still continues to remove today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students set their burners Бунзена 3rd on tap</seg>
<seg id="123">And it's not just hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and мэриях due to their amazing and fire-resistant insulating characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="125">Schools too.</seg>
<seg id="126">In fact, many for the first time, is likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="127">Across the country, countless chemistry lessons, students set their burners Бунзена 3rd on tap.</seg>
<seg id="128">Websites have appeared, highlighting the problem of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as floor tiles or roof сараев usually contained asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"This is an industrial poison in a huge number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Лоусона Guy in a case against the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case, the only contact, which might have been dubious about the recall, the woman was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So be careful, снося garden sheds.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effect of the diagnosis, when we know that the disease is incurable, is huge.</seg>
<seg id="134">"To realize it, is quite a lot of time," says Graham moment.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to continue, but realized that I couldn't focus on what I'm doing.</seg>
<seg id="136">I had surgery in two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I realized that I have to go and deal with them.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I'm no longer a Christmas</seg>
<seg id="139">One of the most difficult things was the transition from doctor to patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">As countless patients before him, he remembers, was shot down with the amount of information that had to be taken.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was difficult to understand," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked his doctor" how many I have time? "</seg>
<seg id="143">They gave me about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember, as I thought, "Well, I am no longer a Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's all. "</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, as it is the mechanics of how we support life - the very act of breathing, raises cancer, which kills.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases are caused by мезотелиомы contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos is composed of tiny fibers.</seg>
<seg id="149">When asbestos is being destroyed and the carcinogenic fibers, they can get stuck in the lungs, плевре shell.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibers are annoying плевру and can cause mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem is due to the inhalation of asbestos fibres needle," Professor Tom Трежер кардиоторакальный, a surgeon, who came to the hospital in 2001, Guy.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is the hospital, where the suspect, Andrew Lawson, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="153">Трежер Лоусона knew and treated some of the others who, perhaps, was exposed to while in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">When Sally Goodin Sally goodun Etc asbestos in the lung tissue, "says Трежер, unload their breath on the periphery, where the shell.</seg>
<seg id="155">It is, in its essence, invasive process from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="156">Common treatment options for other forms of cancer is much less efficient the type.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of surgery, for example, cause hot debate.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some think it is worth a try.</seg>
<seg id="159">Трежер disagrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">"You can't cut плевру," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">No good around her with a knife.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, the cancer is not "very well treated" chemotherapy, which "acts", but not people.</seg>
<seg id="163">"From time to time there are patients who live a long time," says Трежер.</seg>
<seg id="164">But in the end, they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some patients are living much, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">Writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years after diagnosis, Graham moment continues to fight.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he became ill attributable to mesothelioma, Andrew Лоусоном Эбботта learnt that, four years after the diagnosis, single-handedly turned into the offices of support and advice for patients.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Yes, Раковая Central," he said cheerfully, when they called.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," says moment.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was diagnosed with four years ago, and he still is very energetic.</seg>
<seg id="172">First Эбботту offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and prolonged his life only a month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was in despair," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, managed to somewhat more positive agenda. "</seg>
<seg id="176">Meeting with several specialists, the moment he decided to continue treatment with Professor Лоиком Ланж-Лаздунски second, a professor of surgery at Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage in that I don't need it, I just called them and they took me," admits Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">Likely the patient would have to get the direction and approval for funding.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money plays a decisive role for patients with attributable to mesothelioma, to get the best available treatments.</seg>
<seg id="180">But when such treatments become ineffective, finally, inevitably, many patients still face with one financial reason for concern "about the future of families that they would leave.</seg>
<seg id="181">And then they ask the courts for compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan, of Field Fisher Price Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It has been known that asbestos is harmful to health, in 1898," said Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But that changed in the 1960s, it became clear that even very small amounts can put their health at risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">It was then spoke about the bad faith of companies.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson, and Guy's Hospital, ultimately, resolve the case, but it was not "the full cost of the settlement," said Morgan, as Lawson could not prove unequivocally that it was mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation into his death, hospital spokesman Guy is confirmed, however, that "asbestos in its basement, talked about, was removed in the 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="188">It was too late for Andrew Лоусона.</seg>
<seg id="189">How to remove asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">In fact, tie a contact with asbestos to one company or place of work - usually through dozens of years after that, it turned out to be a big problem for patients with attributable to mesothelioma, demanding compensation.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have owner or shut down.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance archives could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who have protected from lawsuits, and know that on their side, which plaintiffs have, of course, is no.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, this year took serious new legislative acts which facilitate the process of recovery attributable to mesothelioma patients with compensation, even if it is impossible to keep track of their former employers.</seg>
<seg id="195">In accordance with this law, was £350-миллионный fund of funds, which is financed by the insurance industry, for those who had been diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove, but did not contact anyone with whom to sue.</seg>
<seg id="196">In such cases, patients will receive 80 percent of the amount that the court could award in a case about the compensation of about £120,000.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected to each year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with attributable to mesothelioma, believes that the £350 million represent a "very good work" for the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"This is the fact that insurance companies, for insurers," he says, hinting that the sum is a quarter of that, insurers would have to pay, if not intervened, with a temporary period attributable to mesothelioma sufferers and could trace the company and file a lawsuit in the usual way.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even Mike Пеннинг, formerly the minister of labour and pensions, acknowledged that the law "imperfect."</seg>
<seg id="201">However Пеннинг and Morgan, and recognize that, while seven people die every day, rapid action was needed.</seg>
<seg id="202">"People suffer so much, and they need help now," said Пеннинг during the second reading of the Bill of type in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">By the time Graham moment was in the hands of Professor Лоика Ланж-Лаздунски 19 months.</seg>
<seg id="204">After the initial consultation Ланж-Лаздунски recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Трежера, he believes to be effective.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was followed by radiation and chemotherapy - тритерапия Ланж-Лаздунски, which boasts a solid 40 percent of patients surviving for five years.</seg>
<seg id="206">Moment felt a surge of strength.</seg>
<seg id="207">"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says moment.</seg>
<seg id="208">You see these patients all the time.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is a force that supports you.</seg>
<seg id="210">When сдаешься, condition can deteriorate very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham moment went to the surgery in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">By the end of August he finished the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">The scan showed no trace of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had a scan in March [2014].</seg>
<seg id="215">There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I just had to come.</seg>
<seg id="217">This is not a threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="218">This is the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="219">And again the moment went through six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now there is no trace of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="221">However, this process is both physically and emotionally heavy.</seg>
<seg id="222">You can think about practical things - about finances, and when I die, for example, or about the fact that we need to show his wife, works as a timer to бойлере.</seg>
<seg id="223">When you get bad news, you become безрадостным.</seg>
<seg id="224">You need to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="225">As the father of Ellie, 16, and 14 years, this Тэмзин is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">"It is difficult for a parent," he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.</seg>
<seg id="228">For the first time when I was diagnosed, I told the girls that I had the disease, which means that I shall not live for old age.</seg>
<seg id="229">They reacted very differently.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose their leaders; protesters promise revenge</seg>
<seg id="2">China's parliament decided Sunday to not allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reforms.</seg>
<seg id="3">Such a move is likely to mark the beginning of long ago promised protests in Hong Kong as activists have begun planning and mobilization in a matter of hours after that statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the 11th National People's Congress, in fact, communist leaders to remove all the candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's not обмануло our expectations, but still leads in rage," said legislator Emily Лау, chairman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's not that Beijing had promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">They lied to the people of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defending the decision of China, Li Fey, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the 11th National People's Congress, said that to allow the public to nominate for the election of Hong Kong would be too "erratic behavior."</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing promised to allow residents of the region through a vote to choose the head of government, starting in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chinese leaders have made the decision as a democratic step forward, since it gives a direct vote гонконгцам right; however, the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold in his hands the process with the help of the Commission for the candidates, rigidly controlled from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, according to a new article that only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision was taken after the summer, when there have been some of the most large-scale and received wide coverage of protests in Hong Kong for many years.</seg>
<seg id="14">For a large part of the campaign after the movement in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, which threatened to cut off the financial district in Hong Kong if Beijing does not guarantee of universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday night, several hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central gathered in the rain to Hong Kong government headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="16">The organizers of the demonstration said that their movement is shifting to a new phase of civil disobedience and that they rise to waves of protest in the following weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, they have not reported the details, obviously, to avoid problems with state authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In онлайн-заявлении, the organizers said the movement "to capture the central region обдумывало only as an exceptional measure, action that can be taken only if all the possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We regret to inform you that today, all possibilities have been exhausted and the seizure of the central district of dialogue will take place.</seg>
<seg id="20">Authorities in Hong Kong to Beijing's statement a few days, and on Sunday the government had strengthened security measures involving police and barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">The unrest is the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their own city.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of residents from mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">The fear is that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement, saying that his demonstration to jeopardize business is the lifeblood of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protest, which they say, it could lead to a big economic damage, depending on how many people will participate, and for how long," said the legislator, Regina survive for a long time, which is critical of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="26">We do not want to spread concern about the fact that Hong Kong is out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This view, which is harmful for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chinese state media have also reported in recent days, activists of the democratic movement in Hong Kong which were shown диверсантами undertaken by western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral law, which drew 7th - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists are raising the issue of race and the behaviour of the police after Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">Unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Фергюсоне, Missouri, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">Coming raise hands, chanting: "Hands up, don't стреляй" while they are waiting in the queue.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Missouri Фергюсоне, associated with the murder of teenager Michael Brown, blogger безоружного зоила Miriam Perez noticed a shift in интернет-разговоре among white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">In her experience, the white feminists, stamps, comments on gender above race, when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, as the tension grew in the Midwest and attracted national attention, Peres saw the white women who focused 100 percent on the race.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared with the reaction of black women shortly after the killing on 9 August, personal essays with such titles as "thoughts about Фергюсоне from white women" and "Феминизм is not only about угнетении women" appeared relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Perez, they demonstrated a significant shift.</seg>
<seg id="9">"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who are talking about white skin and privileges at such a high level," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People feel the need to say something about what has happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is a very symbolic for the crisis with which we are faced, and because of the situation in Фергюсоне) is so tied to race, they feel that these should be.</seg>
<seg id="12">For Professor of English at the University of Ohio State Кориты Mitchell Ferguson has laid bare problems that blacks face every day, but one which is not perceived as a "women's problems" in the cultural sphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can write something funny on Facebook about what was going on with me and my partner, and get 150 лайков from everywhere," says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">When I write something about how people of color are under assault in his own country, silence stuns.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Why do women safe to speak publicly about the relationship, but not about the security in the public sector?" She asks.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women, like Mitchell, who studied the issues of race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between matters relating to race and gender.</seg>
<seg id="17">From the point of view of blacks, women are in a position to clearly separate the problems; they are faced with a complex reality every day.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women now bring together issues of race and gender in feminist мейнстриме, Энджела Хэттери, professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that its predecessor did.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 1865 and 1890 линчевали for years, at least 10,000 black men, it is almost always served and the rape of a white woman," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="20">There was a white woman, was the story, to Nepal.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the point of view of Хэттери, the gap between white and black women, white суфражистки occurred when, for example, Susan B. Anthony looked at the situation in the late 1800s, and saw that the fight for suffrage will be effective only for one of the groups: Women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They have decided to lay down all the eggs in the basket of voting rights for women, and the right to vote for blacks was to appear later," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="23">Looking back on things like this gives us a clear idea of why women of color don't trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have not done anything good.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to white women united against линчеваний Association in the South for women preventing линчеваний.</seg>
<seg id="27">This group is almost 40 years after the first was asked to help blacks, women, Mitchell said.</seg>
<seg id="28">From the point of view of Mitchell, the reactions of white feminists on the issues raised in the conduct of the police, "Фергюсоне, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white a feminist had to" catch up "problems that blacks, women live up in several generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It is true, it would be great if a militant, which have such a [traditional] феминистическая ideology, so too have the right to raise a child, as they relate to the right to contraception?" Asked Mitchell.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric vehicle market</seg>
<seg id="2">This week the Ministry of Economic Development will make the government a comprehensive plan for the development of clean transport in Russia, told the deputy director of the ministry, Oleg Плужников round table that held the newspaper Vedomosti declared in Moscow - 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">The plan drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals is to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is expected that the document will be passed in late September, early October, says the proposed measures concerning Плужников, hybrids and electric vehicles - a development plan for газомоторном fuel in Russia already have.</seg>
<seg id="5">The plan (a copy of the Vedomosti for 2014-2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">To develop the criteria for the evaluation of electrical and hybrid vehicles and decide how to promote the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">The government report, which will be described in the tax and customs measures quality support, will be prepared by December 2014; concessional lending scheme and preferential leasing will appear by April 2015, and proposals to reduce the prices of cars, and encourage the creation of service the infrastructure will be developed by October 2015</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014-2015, it is expected to make changes in regulations to ease conditions for the construction of the infrastructure charge (parking, petrol stations etc.).</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, federal officials plan for 2015 to formulate proposals for regional authorities, as well as to promote the use of clean transport - in the form of providing him with the movement and parking, for example; and by February 2016 and the expansion of government purchases of such transport.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, now the Ministry of Economic Development by October 2014 will bring in a list of indicators of regional authorities criteria, reflecting the effectiveness of support for the production of environmentally friendly transport, the development of the infrastructure charge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Vehicle market in Russia, while only formed in 2013 across the country sold around 100 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the beginning of 2014 обнулена an import duty on electric cars, so sales will be approximately 500 pieces predicts, Chief Executive Officer of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="13">But Baltsi growth does not make any noticeable: Electric cars in Russia in 2013, according to the Association of European Businesses, sold 2,78 million cars and light commercial vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="14">While electric cars in Russia imports only Mitsubishi Motors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Start import is preparing Renault - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says director for strategic planning and partnerships in Russia Renault Nicolas Ремиз.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most other manufacturers of electric transport took in relation to Russia is hedging its bets.</seg>
<seg id="17">The development of electric cars and Russian manufacturers GAZ directors "," ",", "but the trivial.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in January - July 2014, according to the "АСМ-холдинга," Avtovaz has issued 30 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="19">Modest demand because of soaring prices, admits director of AvtoVAZ in Latvia, Sergei Аманов, without state support will not be a breakthrough in this segment.</seg>
<seg id="20">The development of the Russian market in electric cars (in addition to the cost of the electric cars that are sold in Russia, on average, twice as much as analogues with internal combustion engines) holds an underdeveloped infrastructure charge (my "units)," sighs CEO Sergei Целиков Автостата ".</seg>
<seg id="21">Because of the soaring prices and low rates of reducing the cost of electric cars in the next 3-4 years remain нишевым segment of the Russian market forecasts, editor in chief of "Авторевю" Mikhail Подорожанский Целиков, agrees with him.</seg>
<seg id="22">Car manufacturers, in contrast, say that some vehicle models are close to the value of the ordinary.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Russian market substantially good prospects, the important thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "real" электромобильность; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of the new charging stations, president of BMW's Wolfgang Шлимме.</seg>
<seg id="24">Such infrastructure projects, for example, sells госкомпания Россети ":" In Moscow, several stations, soon there will be more about 80.</seg>
<seg id="25">Talks about building my network and negotiations with other regions.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to the director of the department "Россетей" Vladimir Софьина, the company believes the market is ready to build electric and gas stations across the country, but there are problems: A small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging different brands.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, "Россети" as network the company does not have the right to engage in the sale of electricity, being able to do this in relation to charging.</seg>
<seg id="28">His wife believes the most effective measure of state support for vehicle market in Russia progeSOFT customs duties.</seg>
<seg id="29">Zero rate will act before the end of 2014, its renewal and expansion of the preferential list.</seg>
<seg id="30">The transportation tax to environmental (the idea is being discussed and concerns all cars) also will support the market, but not as noticeably as customs preferences, his wife said.</seg>
<seg id="31">Tax in Russia is small, said Pankov, unlike, for example, from Norway, where the reduced tax rate led to a sharp increase in electric sales - now they account for 12% of the market.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia and the need for stimulus measures, such as free parking in the city centre (as has been done in Moscow), I am sure Pankov, or any vehicle travel on dedicated lanes, which are not yet in Russia.</seg>

<seg id="6">On the night of August 29, the White House said that President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss imposing additional sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The weakening of the ruble is long-term in nature and, in tandem with the euro, and in tandem with the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="8">The long-term forecast assumed that mark, "says senior analyst at Alpari Anna Бодрова." "</seg>
<seg id="9">All of that has to do with Ukraine, one way or another will be reflected on the courses.</seg>
<seg id="10">As long as this continues, investors will react.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, rumors about the invasion of troops not confirmed nor on the one hand, but the market was very emotional.</seg>
<seg id="12">All the talk about the fact that he was resilient to similar news yesterday were перечеркнуты.</seg>
<seg id="13">This week, according to forecasts, will be closed around these levels, and the rouble 36,90 37,05 per dollar.</seg>

<seg id="18">Still will be watching whether the promised on Saturday to impose sanctions, as will meet NATO.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said the ruble weakened sharply after the tax season, then went to Ukraine, the Central Bank said last week, before the end of the year to a fully floating exchange rate and waives any currency interventions.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you look at the daytime wobble, it is no different from previous during this month, all have spooked that mark in 37 rubles, "continued the analyst.</seg>
<seg id="21">And so, in terms of turnover not a nothing happened.</seg>
<seg id="22">Worrying times for the currency market was, let me remind you that, at the end of January, when there was increased demand for the currency, as well as a third of March, when the Central Bank отгрузил a record number of currency.</seg>
<seg id="23">In UFS IC and see the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="24">First of all, the growth of revenue from export operations, as well as improving the competitiveness of the domestic manufacturers at the expense of more expensive imports, says chief analyst UFS IC Alexei Kozlov.</seg>
<seg id="25">Negative moments can be attributed to the price of imported goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of the investment in the Russian economy, rising inflation pressures and, as a result, become more expensive for borrowing funds which, in turn, slows down the development of the country's economy.</seg>
<seg id="27">If we talk about the stock market, the rouble devaluation smoothes over a decline in stock prices, expressed in roubles.</seg>
<seg id="28">For example, the MICEX index during trading Thursday fell 1.67 per cent, while the RTS Index lost 3.27 percent.</seg>
<seg id="29">Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of indices due to the weakening of the ruble during the day more than 1.5%.</seg>
<seg id="30">The weakening of the ruble is an emotional character and a desire to buy the currency.</seg>
<seg id="31">In practice, gradually go on emotions, and quotes the ruble partially or completely restore lost ground.</seg>
<seg id="32">"We believe, soon we will be able to see the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles to the dollar," said Alexei Kozlov.</seg>

<seg id="2">Восстанавливающаяся economy means more customers, the more sales and jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Account for taxes on the state and local level for companies across the country, moderately increased in the last year, which accelerated the recovery, according to a new study, published last week, and the company in the Washington area is no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion in the coffers of the state and local level in fiscal 2013, to 3.8 percent more than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tax burden on business in the state and local level in the past year rose by 4.3 per cent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after avoiding each other, smaller, bank accounts in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">State taxes, rose 4.3 percent, faster than the local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to the research, which was conducted by professional services firm, Ernst & Young and the Center on taxation, the tax policy.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of tax revenue in the county, 56 percent, in taxes on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of tax revenue for Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the amount of tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="10">To a large extent, is caused by the growth of tax revenues return to the same level of the value of a property company, say the researchers, that raised property taxes by 3.7 per cent this year, after three years in a row, when growth was less than 1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large proportion of those earnings in larger states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same thing is happening in the Washington area.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion in property taxes at the state and local level in the past year, to $9.6 billion more than in 2012, an increase of 4.2 per cent, compared with the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the return of the value of the property does not have a similar effect on the growth of tax revenue for the state and local level in Maryland, where the property taxes just more than one-fifth of the companies' tax bills.</seg>
<seg id="14">Virginia and the District of Columbia pay tax accounts for about half of the state and local level, in the form of taxes on real estate.</seg>
<seg id="15">"What is happening in Maryland is that such a large part of its property tax base, particularly around the District of Columbia belongs to either the government or nonprofit organization that does not pay property taxes," said Douglas Линдхолм, executive director of the Center on taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, Maryland had to rely more on, for example, income taxes to pay for the service, which is the same in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent increase in tax receipts from businesses cannot fully explain the recovery of the real estate market.</seg>
<seg id="18">Income entrepreneurs also, it seems, is on the mend, according to this data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Companies in the region, Chinese corporate income tax at the state level, in the amount of $2.3 billion to $2.1 billion more than in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland has collected $1 billion of corporate income tax, the most in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although the trend in one direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase with the same speed in all three areas.</seg>
<seg id="22">The level of growth in the District of Columbia was on the same level as the average for the country of 4.3 per cent, while growth was significantly faster in Maryland, 4.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only Virginia was the rise in tax revenues, equal to the average of 4.1 per cent.</seg>

<seg id="5">Given the present situation on the market, a musical плачевную situation of lambasted, because this is not about new Lana del Ray, or another сладкоголосом a new 'R' n 'B', and about the appearance of the British duo быковатых, playing with volume and intensity, that the last time was in vogue two decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">In general, rates on the first album in connection with all вышеозначенными circumstances were especially high and it is quite justified.</seg>
<seg id="7">The duo took their name not in vain, that this could prejudice isn't that quite so desperate and hairy metalheads, which flows the blood of kings, how they think, they have in the veins, too.</seg>

<seg id="9">To make predictions about the success of this enterprise until, perhaps, pretty early, but you can have something to say.</seg>

<seg id="15">And this is not necessarily bad, on the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Royal Blood, in that they do not claim the new idea of Lennon and McCartney (rather too mark in successors Motörhead), but made numerous рок-дуэты инди-клубов from the ghetto.</seg>

<seg id="4">Three months ago it is selling a billion Google видеосервису looked completely finished, and this combination was a natural.</seg>

<seg id="10">It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube failed, given that, reportedly, he was willing to pay not less than Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">All that we have at the moment is a statement from Executive Director it Эммета Shire: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us get there faster."</seg>

<seg id="22">It is hard to imagine that it свернется in Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube would simply absorb it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cunning ways to save on university textbooks</seg>
<seg id="2">The fact that the cost of university textbooks for many students more than $1000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will go for a second course, came up with an ingenious way to reduce costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">He developed a system of how to take a book, offering them старшекурсников have rated compensation that they delayed their sale.</seg>
<seg id="4">"My textbook on mathematical analysis, which usually costs $180 for a semester, I got $10 and biscuits" Chick-fil-A "," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying in Ковенант College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">All the literature last semester cost would be $430, he says.</seg>
<seg id="6">He spent $120.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the Council, the average college student spends $1,200 a year on books and supplies, but the students have a number of options to reduce these costs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas, such as the system ’.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rent books is becoming more popular, allowing students to use the book for the semester, and costs are often considerably cheaper than buying them.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Нибо Инкорпорейтид", which holds more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of rental books grew by half since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">Industry studies show that about a quarter of books in university bookstores during the past spring semester were taken, "said vice president Trevor Нибо" Meyer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstores, according to the National Association of the university professional union "shops".</seg>
<seg id="13">Here's introductory course on the best ways to make a bargain.</seg>
<seg id="14">Buying in online store</seg>
<seg id="15">Sometimes, if you'll come out with a new book on the internet, the price may be one third from the one that you'll see in the university bookshop.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis," Ron Larson ’ s Bruce Edwards's and Robert Хостетлера worth about $290 privately, but a new instance can be purchased for $239,99 site Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Buying used</seg>
<seg id="18">If you don't mind other people's notes or damage, second-hand textbooks is a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Mathematical analysis" sold for $93,49 подержанном on to Chegg.com.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Кэсэдей, 25 years, a fourth year student at the University of Бригэм Young, said that paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for the textbook is an instance of "strategic decisions in the media: An understanding of the business side of the advertising business."</seg>
<seg id="21">The book sold for $48.</seg>
<seg id="22">Teachers, for instance, Ingrid Брейси, director of "College without walls" at the University of Massachusetts in Эмхерсте, offers to students with their professors, could use the previous editions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates are insignificant for lessons.</seg>
<seg id="24">In such cases, the old editions can often be found in a very small fraction of the cost of the latest edition.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition to websites Amazon and Chegg, Half.com, "owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying second-hand books.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hire</seg>
<seg id="27">About to rent textbooks, you need to think, if you're good enough to deal with them, don't forget to return them and don't want to leave them yourself after the course is completed.</seg>
<seg id="28">You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, a student could rent a "Математический analysis" for a semester for about $20.</seg>
<seg id="30">Find out the rules of the store, where you take books, including any fines that you can write a check for, and the damage.</seg>
<seg id="31">If you take a book, remember: If you do not upon a book, fines may even exceed the cost of the new instance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Electronic books</seg>
<seg id="33">Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks is another option.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sometimes, these books take the rent, buying electronic license for a certain period for retailers, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Rent" on the site Chegg.com Mathematical Analysis for six months will cost about $61.</seg>
<seg id="36">Брейси says that students who study literature, can often find the most advantageous prices, as many of the classics can now be the favorite, while the literature on natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.</seg>
<seg id="37">No matter what, осмотритесь.</seg>
<seg id="38">Joe reports, 29 years old, which is going to begin studies in Legal Пеппердин school, recommends that use the ISBN number for a book on prices, as this will ensure that you are looking for precisely the right you text.</seg>
<seg id="39">In order to do before the Internet, says reports, be sure to check whether a book is in stock.</seg>
<seg id="40">The lesson he was 52.</seg>
<seg id="41">The book, which he bought, was postponed for four weeks, and, in the end, he paid the full price in the university bookshop.</seg>

<seg id="40">On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree applying specific economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which is basically food sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="41">The country banned the import of pork, beef and by-product from meat, poultry, meat, fish, shellfish, milk, cheese, yogurt, cheeses, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausage and sugar syrups.</seg>
<seg id="42">Restaurants have begun jockeying seems with suppliers: Food prices have increased, we need to urgently seek counterparts from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="43">This will affect the most expensive restaurants монокухней from France, Italy, Spain, in which products supplied directly from "motherships" countries.</seg>
<seg id="44">Общепиту was carrying earlier.</seg>
<seg id="45">For example, when, at the beginning of 2014, the Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and the year before - the American and Canadian meat.</seg>
<seg id="46">In return, providers have supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="47">But sanctions лета-2014 were far more serious.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the president's decree, which lifted the ban fry Atlantic salmon and trout безлактозное seed potatoes, milk, sugar, corn, peas and onions for replanting.</seg>
<seg id="49">The Italian transfer hopes that sanctions might still смягчиться.</seg>

<seg id="52">"Expensive restaurants to change menu under the produce of local farmers and other countries," says Sergei Mironov, AL, owner of the agency "Рестконсалт."</seg>
<seg id="53">If a chef, for him it's not going to be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="54">But we have very few chefs, and for the development of a new menu may take two or three months.</seg>
<seg id="55">From the restaurant Brasserie Тригель "The Bridge" prepared to refuse: By 10-15%, still half the menu, recycle.</seg>
<seg id="56">In restaurants with a kitchen are starting to replace dishes, for example steak of beef - the marble бефстроганов, says Sergei Mironov.</seg>
<seg id="57">"Cheeses from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian cheese, cheese from Serbia, Chile, Argentina, Tunisia," lists the "East-West" Oksana Глибчук.</seg>
<seg id="58">Cream and milk products from Europe have counterparts in Russia and Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="59">Chicken from the United States may be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus, and salmon from Norway семга - salmon, семгой, those from Belarus and Chile.</seg>

<seg id="62">Although it is difficult to have to establishments in the Project, he says.</seg>
<seg id="63">The Project in several dozen restaurants under different brands and with their menu.</seg>
<seg id="64">The replacement will take plenty of time, "said Mironov.</seg>

<seg id="73">If our owned Russia imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we even win in price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="74">From the CIS can be cheaper to get engineering, sausages, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit.</seg>

<seg id="18">Savings certificate will be registered and безотзывным</seg>
<seg id="19">The Ministry of Finance wants ban on bearer savings certificates, but will allow banks to do their analogue безотзывного contribution.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Finance Ministry is preparing a bill that banned savings certificates on the bearer.</seg>
<seg id="21">Lately, this tool is gaining popularity, as rates are higher here than on bank deposits.</seg>
<seg id="22">The fact is that savings certificates on the bearer not the bank deposit insurance system, and they cost less, because they don't have to make payments to the Fund Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA).</seg>
<seg id="23">Successfully situation that this step will be taken because of the small and medium-sized banks, spreading such certificates, and suffer from Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which estimates that the DIA, control 98 per cent of demand.</seg>
<seg id="24">With the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, is about 3.5%.</seg>
<seg id="25">The problem, explains the DIA, lies in the fact that a small bank customers, who bought such a certificate, in case of withdrawal of the license is trying to get money from him in the DIA.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates bearer, may assume that their investment is insured.</seg>
<seg id="27">The absence of reasonable insurance payments on these certificated in case of license revocation by the bank can lead to misunderstandings and social tensions.</seg>
<seg id="28">In practice, the agencies were cases when holders предъявительских certificates were trying to rescue the insurance compensation through the courts, "the DIA said.</seg>
<seg id="29">The problem, of course, made-up.</seg>
<seg id="30">The certificates pay buyers still nobody will, because under the law they have no right to compensation from the State.</seg>
<seg id="31">If the case was that the instrument is pointed in, together with him and would have banned metal accounts, which means citizens are taken into consideration in grams of one of four metal - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.</seg>
<seg id="32">Since these accounts do not fall into a system of deposit insurance, but their existence as long as no one deprives.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is likely that the bearer certificates are a very convenient security, which may actually act as квазиденег.</seg>
<seg id="34">With almost no control of their movement: Any bank customer can buy a certificate to any citizen, and bacteria can change the certificate to a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is not by chance that the draft that savings certificate should be necessarily personal security, which must be stored in depositories.</seg>
<seg id="36">But Kid to one, banks are allowed to issue such certificates without the right to early repayment.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have introduced similar безотзывного contribution, which has long been a dream of the bankers.</seg>

<seg id="1">The two met union</seg>
<seg id="2">At the highest level talks in Minsk is not decided, for the sake of the problems which were called back, but created a new format: The European Union met with the chief executives of the Eurasian future</seg>
<seg id="3">And let on about the situation around Ukraine тревожному (very urgent does not tolerate), the Customs Union and for the first time EU leaders discussed a number of "hot issues."</seg>
<seg id="4">It is capable of such a structure to work effectively, it is not clear; but it is clear who took the cream from that summit.</seg>
<seg id="5">Questions on this one evening on August 26, when the Belarusians, and after them and other евразийцы Europeans saw a television with a new President Lukashenko.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Belarusian leader revealed an example of polished talent, this was the behaviour of a man who had just caught the jackpot - and is planning a decent old age in high society.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Maidan helped Lukashenko</seg>
<seg id="8">The arrival in Minsk at the three main European commissioners (of EU ministers), who met with Mr. Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf -- not just легитимация president for the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is the subject of an application for recognition of a full European policy and the campaign of the Ukrainian crisis.</seg>
<seg id="10">A senior analyst with the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies Denis Мельянцов sure: From Brussels will not have to talk with Minsk in the same tone as before.</seg>
<seg id="11">"What Catherine Ashton met face to face with Lukashenko, gives reason to believe that the relationship with the EU will be размораживаться and beyond," he said "Огоньку."</seg>
<seg id="12">This is the hidden part of the iceberg: Preparing to push the Belarusian authorities began long before November Maidan in Kiev - 2013-го in the summer.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The results have been achieved and the EU is the successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues about modernization," interlocutor "Ogonyok which lists," and with the United States have held talks on international security.</seg>
<seg id="14">States even took a little bit of sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="15">As regards the Ukrainian events, they and the response to them have only invoked another influx of this process.</seg>
<seg id="16">Minsk, on the one hand, managed to keep relations with Ukraine are warm enough to not lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for talks.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other, the Belarusian leader not de jure, who admitted joining of Crimea to Russia and has urged to punish pro-Russian militia in the Donbas with the severity, and quarreled with Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="18">Minsk has not released any of the Customs Union, nor of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, and the web is the Russian air base.</seg>
<seg id="19">Brussels and Washington have a balanced position of Minsk to the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated her confident Belarusian experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">How successful will the movement's political diversification, will be seen by how often the Minsk should ever take meetings in the format of the EU + TC.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy Catherine Ashton and diplomacy have failed to answer questions about what it wants from the relationship in a new format.</seg>
<seg id="22">A spokesman for Ashton said only "Mayan Косьянчич Огоньку" that decisions on issues of war and peace, this issue is not a priority.</seg>
<seg id="23">While there were reports that following a meeting on the Ukraine issue, with the participation of the people in the new format may be, and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="24">A drop of tar in Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that, for him, it turns out, personally asked the representatives of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nevertheless, the final briefing Alexander Lukashenko made it clear: Against all parties not to Minsk remained central to meetings in Россия--ОБСЕ--Украина format, and at the level of Heads of State and high representatives of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="26">This means that "the last dictator in Europe" quite рукопожатного acquires the status of European leader that helps to solve a global problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">The European farmer's best friend</seg>
<seg id="28">Already part of the EU delegation, which included еврокомиссаров on trade and energy, pushed to the conclusion: The main underlying reason for the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbas, and economy.</seg>
<seg id="29">In fact, the meeting schedule сверстанное future negotiations for gas supply and to overcome fears the CU on the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU looks greater, achievement than peace declaration without specific dates and numbers.</seg>
<seg id="30">Trade Commissioner Karl De Гюхт, nevertheless, indicates EU representatives: "Arrived in Minsk to seek a political solution to the crisis, which has economic consequences, and not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="31">It seems, however, that the economy and the crisis in Ukraine "is working" in Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its consequences - and primarily reciprocal sanctions the West and Russia, offer cut-price, who still feels the pressure, the long-awaited санкционное room for maneuver.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to the leader of the Mises Research Centre, the Belarus Романчука, European investors are actively interested in opportunities for supplies of agricultural products to Russia in bypassing sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="34">Supplies are in this scheme, for which President Vladimir Putin at the summit пожурил Minsk.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Initiated these schemes," said Romanchuk Огоньку "," are not the Belarusian businessmen and Russian companies.</seg>
<seg id="36">They worked for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes were destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Russian business is in desperate need to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of the Belarusian authorities.</seg>
<seg id="38">The second story, "the expert continues," is related to the fact that many Ukrainian companies not averse to establish production in Belarus of raw materials as well as focusing on the Russian market.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Ukrainian producers about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and the Belarusian производственно-торговые scheme now could be very popular. "</seg>
<seg id="40">According to Романчука, the role of the host site for the negotiations between the EU and the TC is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of the development of economic ties with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="41">He recalls that the loss of the agricultural sector of the EU sanctions against Moscow are estimated at 10 billion euros, and the Commission is currently proposed 5.45 only 125 million euros compensation.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Belarusian president could offer to Brussels to work together to minimise the consequences for еврофермеров.</seg>
<seg id="43">This can raise the authority of Lukashenko in the EU at the verdict.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hospitality without initiatives</seg>
<seg id="45">Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative for the summit.</seg>
<seg id="46">But the paradox is that the Minsk from his active role in the birth of the CU + открещивается EU format, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with Ukrainian counterpart emphasized that the new format and it was.</seg>
<seg id="47">"It was your suggestion to come, without any навала discuss, not with бухты-барахты decide, after signing the Association Agreement with the EU, to sort out the situation, which at that time was in Ukraine," he said in front of cameras to Peter Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, observers interpreted it as an attempt to calm Moscow, she reportedly was initially against the mediation, which greatly increases his political weight.</seg>
<seg id="49">In the Belarusian diplomatic establishment try to stress that cooperation between the EU and Belarus in the organization for not pursuing his TC land lucrative goals, and the ultimate goal of this format in the future - the creation of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.</seg>
<seg id="50">"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts which, in other areas, in particular in the field of security, highlights and promotes the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation," the Foreign Ministry said "Огоньку" agency, in Belarus, where the words were chosen very carefully.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin demands from Kiev to begin negotiations on the "statehood" of eastern Ukraine</seg>
<seg id="2">According to Russian news reports about his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government has stopped fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately started negotiations on the "statehood" отделившегося region.</seg>
<seg id="3">His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later discloses that Putin had in mind to drop hints that восточноукраинская territory controlled by the separatists will become part of Russia, but that we need to reconsider its status within Ukraine, to give русскоговорящему region to defend their rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, Mr Putin's call for the Government to start negotiations with the very insurgents as government-controlled with equal with obvious strategy, which he follows with the bloodshed five months ago, to help bring the separatists and the Ukrainian government to force новопровозглашенной Новороссии of de facto independence, to closer ties with Russia rather than with the West.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with state television channel activity, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return the territory retained in the eastern separatists in Luhansk and Donetsk regions, which were seized in March and April, after Moscow аннексировала Ukrainian peninsula Crimea on March 18.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists recently named captured territory Новороссией, or New Russia, the name, which refers to have preserved the glory days of the Russian empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin said that anyone who believes that the peace talks will occur in the near future, as Ukrainian politicians to campaign for parliamentary elections on October 26, and while government troops attack peace settlement detained separatists in the regions, "" illusions, "ITAR-TASS reported's a prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We must immediately begin substantive talks and not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the status of southeast Ukraine, to serve the interests of the people living there," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskov said that Putin's words about the state had in mind in the context of the broader autonomy, which was discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to allay fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and language rights at risk.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian government could give the eastern regions more autonomy, Peskov said.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and an internal Ukrainian conflict."</seg>
<seg id="12">Press secretary the Kremlin's intervention to rectify any incorrect "interpretation of the words" Putin stressed the decision of the Russian leadership to behave in relation to the breakaway rebellion in the east in any other way than an outdoor seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the population are ethnic Russians 2-миллионного.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would have to withstand a heavy battle, even to the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine and Луганскую, since most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian, prior to the start of the conflict, and polls showed broad support for the desire to stay within Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">Autonomy, which Russian diplomats discussed at international forums gave regional governments in the Ukraine power themselves to trade agreements and foreign policy, in effect giving the Kremlin control over the territory, which would be the core of the Russia teamed with Крымом.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Black Sea peninsula, присоединенном five months ago, is the Russian military fleet, as well as commercial marine institutions and historical sea resorts.</seg>
<seg id="16">In regions between the Russian Rostov region and Крымом also are mines, factories and melting plants that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his inaugural address June 7, after the election of new Ukrainian lawmakers взвесили amendments to the constitution allowing отделившимся give regions greater control over their finances and the status of languages.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, his opinion on autonomy, it seems, is very different from the view of the Kremlin and повстанцев-сепаратистов, used to accuse Moscow of aiding and abetting them.</seg>
<seg id="19">Last call for Putin to Kiev to negotiate with the leaders of the separatists, as with equal, followed by new наступлениями rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks rolled into previously peaceful areas of eastern Ukraine along the Sea of Azov.</seg>
<seg id="20">Russia supported separatists took control of the city in the offensive, which Новоазовск officers of the Ukrainian security services say they are afraid that it is the beginning of the campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory to the Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="21">This led to a large-scale civilian and military efforts to strengthen steel port of Mariupol, with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Новоазовском and narrow in the Crimean peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko on Saturday appealed to the European Union leaders meeting in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which has been independent for 23 years.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We are approaching a point of No Return," Poroshenko warned.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukrainian territory.</seg>
<seg id="25">EU summit had not taken certain measures; leaders urged to draw up a project more harsh sanctions against Russia, which will be taken in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.</seg>
