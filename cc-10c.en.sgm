<seg id="1">Recalling a very American ideal that labor rights are human rights</seg>
<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have offered the bill, which is protected by the unions as a civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Where unions and middle-class jobs," says Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, who is the co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive factions.</seg>
<seg id="4">That's why I proudly represent Act expanding workers ’ rights, together with the symbol of the movement for civil rights by John Lewis.</seg>
<seg id="5">This innovative bill will give workers the same opportunities for legal discrimination against organizations, trade unions, and other forms of discrimination, bringing to power foes of trade unions</seg>
<seg id="6">Modification of the regulation of labour relations in such a way as to allow the workers encountering discrimination for the participation in trade union organizations, to seek justice in the civil courts, and compensation and punitive damages payments - a sensible and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it's certainly not radical initiative - at least by American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the best way to understand the fact that offer Ellison, Lewis and co-authors of the bill, "recall is a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the attacks, which the unions have in recent years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country, Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, to expand and to respect human rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country at the same time, defend democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas MacArthur and his assistants have helped the country to adopt a constitution, to ensure that my command Хидеки Тодзё was replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included text that explicitly admitted that "the right of workers to organize and negotiate, and collective action is guaranteed."</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Эйзенхауер and his assistants have helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that the fascism of Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recognizing that workers will need to be organized and be heard in the new state, the Germans have included an article that openly stated: "The right to form associations with the aim to protect and improve employment and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict or seek to diminish that right, will not have legal force; measures for these purposes, will be considered illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">When former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was president of the International Commission on Human Rights, which was World Declaration of Human Rights, which in 1948, will be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and included stating that "everyone has the right to organize and join unions to protect their interests."</seg>
<seg id="17">Generations of Americans have taken the basic position that labor rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country advised on other countries about how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans have explained that the right to organize labor unions - and the fact that this union has participated as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - should be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now, when these rights are under assault in America, wise, indeed, return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize, and that their voices were heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:</seg>
<seg id="21">History is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now everyone knows that the trade union movement is not undermined the nation's power, but increased them.</seg>
<seg id="23">Raising the living standards of millions, unions miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to fragile level of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack the unions, forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.</seg>
<seg id="25">History remembers should and to us.</seg>
<seg id="26">The official recognition of labour rights as human rights and the protection of civil rights, to prevent discrimination against organizations, trade unions, was long overdue.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the U.S., a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the law in Louisiana, which his supporters say he is likely to close all five абортных clinics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to this measure, which was signed by the Governor of Louisiana Bobby Джинадлом in June and was supposed to go into effect on September 1, doctors who do abortions, were obliged to have powers of patients in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the adjudicator's decision means that, at the moment, doctors can continue to make legal abortion, while continuing to look for such powers.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Complainants will be allowed to work legally, continuing actions to gain power," he wrote in his decision, Judge John деГрэвеллз.</seg>
<seg id="6">The hearing will be scheduled within the next month, at which the judge bear a more permanent solution on this law.</seg>
<seg id="7">Abortion rights advocates met with joy at the decision, the latest in a succession of decisions against similar measures, saying it will give doctors more time to receive hospital authority.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today's decision ensures that the women will be protected from the United Louisiana law, which seeks to deprive them of the health and human rights," said Nancy Нортап, president and head of the Center for reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the five clinics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the decision to the doctors from two clinics, which were claimants in the case, and also filed a declaration on authority.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, and the courts have recognized such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="11">Key parts of the law, which would be техасского closed most of the remaining clinics in this state, were blocked by federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fighters for the right to abortion, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association say the laws impose on the credentials of doctors that are not necessary from the medical point of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, though some also pointed to positive effect in the closing clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only one doctor who does abortions in Louisiana, there are powers of the reception in the hospital, according to the Center for reproductive Rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all the other doctors in the state will be forced to stop performing the procedure, the doctor, fearing for their safety, could no longer perform the procedure, told the group.</seg>
<seg id="16">Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they would punish doctors doing abortions as long as their statements on the powers of decision.</seg>

<seg id="1">What will the introduction of quotas for domestic products</seg>
<seg id="2">Not less than half of products for each product in the range trading networks should be the Russian production, says the State Duma deputy from the Just Russia faction, "Oleg Nilov.</seg>
<seg id="3">The MP has prepared a draft law aimed at introducing protective measures for domestic producers, the newspaper Izvestia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The document will still some points will be amended or specified, in order to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.</seg>
<seg id="5">This applies to goods that are produced in Russia. <... > As the rest of the groups of products, which are produced in Russia, the will provide at least half of the production of their domestic producers, "Nilov told the publication.</seg>
<seg id="6">Together with the amendments, in the article "On the basis of state regulation of trading activities in the Russian Federation," the bill provides for the introduction of changes to the Tax Code, laying down a 10% rate of VAT in Norway with the implementation of the products produced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea to introduce a 50% quota in -процентную retail chains included in the stimulus package for Russian producers.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the shelves there will be several times more than domestic goods.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, this initiative can have both a positive and a negative effect, say the experts.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to attorney Налоговик ", a member of the independent centre of expertise" Public Duma Sergei Litvinenko for the Russian economy, as well as for domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive, and will lead to growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">The gallery will be key, farmers, and small shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">They will be able to sell more, and it means that profits will grow.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms and prices, retailers because they will be forced to buy their goods.</seg>
<seg id="14">Russian manufacturers will be able to increase the volume of its activities and sales that would pay higher taxes than before.</seg>
<seg id="15">This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, industries will grow any faster осваиваться, will be introduced to contribute to the growth of GDP.</seg>
<seg id="16">Russia's dependence on foreign food down several times, but not immediately, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="17">Earlier, Russian companies are often unable to fight their way to the shelves of local stores due to higher competition from foreign counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche freed itself and you can breathe a sigh of relief.</seg>
<seg id="19">But do not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary inspections to the Russian market will be available food from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="20">In other words, it is now "calm" moment, when the players are already gone, and the new has not yet come.</seg>
<seg id="21">Almost a month later, we can say the demand for Russian raw materials, as well as rising prices for finished products, "said Vice President АиФ.ru first all-Russian social organization" Russian club financial directors, "Tamara Kasyanov.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clearly, the idea of selling in each category at least 50% of the Russian food products will allow us to consolidate the sector for local producers.</seg>
<seg id="23">In that case, they will have to compete with one another, not with products that subsidies at the expense of another state, are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="24">In other words, the buyer will unfold between the companies that operate on a single law.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, says Kasyanov, Russian producers are able to meet 50% of domestic needs compatriots not on all items.</seg>
<seg id="26">And in this situation commercial networks will have "дотягивать" share of Russian goods up to half of the range.</seg>
<seg id="27">In this regard, increasing fears that the burden will be on the shelves.</seg>
<seg id="28">Perhaps, in the guise of manufactured in Russia, will be delivered to foreign products with перебитыми labels, "adds an expert.</seg>
<seg id="29">A negative effect of the imposition of quotas will feel the large retail chains, especially those who cooperate with Boolean importers.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is logical that the job-seeking will suffer and foreign suppliers, because the demand for their products.</seg>
<seg id="31">Litvinenko did not rule out that the law on quotas for Russian goods and could impact on the consumer.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fact is that some of the Russian-made products can yield quality imported ones, while shops will be boosting prices on the second as a scarce commodity.</seg>
<seg id="33">The long-forgotten early in the 2000s, import substitution idea economists have started talking again in February this year because of the ongoing devaluation of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="34">Now, against the background of the difficult relations with the West, the question of the import of products becomes even more urgent.</seg>
<seg id="35">The law is designed to oblige suppliers to retailers under orders from domestic producers.</seg>
<seg id="36">Then we are much faster and more confident we will go on the path of import substitution, and the planning system is necessary for the production of products will be created in a shorter period of time, "says the MP Oleg Nilov.</seg>
<seg id="37">Especially effective mechanism for those quotas will be agricultural sectors, where the potential is particularly high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.</seg>
<seg id="38">Our farmers are able to fully cover the shelves in Russian shops.</seg>

<seg id="1">Inflation came out of the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="2">Whether Russians feel a sharp price increase</seg>
<seg id="3">As a result of Western sanctions and the crosstab inflation accelerates in Russia and not in forecasts уложится, analysts believe, "VTB Capital."</seg>
<seg id="4">According to experts, the deferred effects антисанкций will lead to inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the latest forecast, inflation in 2014 will be $6,5-7,5% next year and even less - 6.5%.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to the newspaper, "Kommersant," this week, "the ministry should make small, but fundamental" changes in macroeconomic forecast up to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the publication, the agency ’ s assessment of inflation in 2015, which will eliminate progeSOFT expected revenue growth of the population.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the forecast, it was assumed that the Russian food sanctions apply a year - until August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">In such a situation, you could assume such high inflation?</seg>
<seg id="10">The current situation involves разовый shock, but понижательный trend of inflation does not change, "said a source for the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="11">Economists from the VTB Capital "is not shared by the government regarding the financial expectations of inflation and the forecast price growth in 2014 at the level of 8%.</seg>
<seg id="12">The main effect of product bans will come together with the possible introduction of the regions of the Russian Federation sales tax (GAP) in 2015, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="13">Inflationary spike in 9% in February, after which the annual pace of price growth will decline, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="14">By the way, last week, Rosstat summed the first inflation results, after Russia introduced a "neat sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="15">АиФ.ru interviewed experts and found their inflationary expectations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Artem Деев, head of research at FC AForex:</seg>
<seg id="17">Price growth is already the main sections of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moreover, when I began to appreciate socially significant products, the government was forced to launch measures to monitor systemic risks to price stability, in order to prevent unreasonable price increases in the short term.</seg>
<seg id="19">Suppliers and retailers already report on a daily basis before the regulatory authorities that the authorities knew exactly who, where and for what reason will trigger an increase in prices.</seg>
<seg id="20">Key drivers of growth in the consumer price index continues to be tremendous pace of capital flight, excessive refinancing the banking sector from the Russian мегарегулятора, convert the flight of foreign currency, as well as an embargo on the import of food products from the countries that joined the sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="21">If inflationary pressures remained under control, the cost of a minimum basket of products have not jumped 12% in only one quarter.</seg>
<seg id="22">A ban on the import of food products provoked shock proposals on the internal market and led to the utterly логичному increase the final cost.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because at this stage we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, and increase self-sufficiency of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production, sanctions continue to bear the risks of inflationary growth component.</seg>
<seg id="24">If you add another here and fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as ухудшенными prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year, inflation could exceed 8%.</seg>
<seg id="25">Alexander Разуваев, director of the analytical department of Alpari. ""</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 1990s, inflation sometimes hit 20-30% per month to zero, it was also higher than the current level, another thing that then it is offset by rapid economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="27">I think at the end of the year inflation will be 8-8,5%.</seg>
<seg id="28">Plato Магута, managing assets of the Fund Магута. "</seg>
<seg id="29">An external factor associated with sanctions against Russia, while successfully contained, but if there is a further increase of the pressure, first of all, the financial sector - this can lead to a certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations, which usually have traditionally been cash purchases in foreign currency to protect their savings.</seg>
<seg id="30">It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance will try to smooth the weakening of the ruble, as market practices and government regulation.</seg>
<seg id="31">But prices traditionally begins after the summer lull, and perhaps this fall will become more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="32">The target level of consumer inflation in Russia, 7.5%, most likely, a weapon, as Russia has another financial savings.</seg>

<seg id="15">"As far as the proposed settlements on the constructive elements, in practice this is implementable, because the building is often use different technologies," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is no secret that стройрынок is largely thanks to the госзаказу.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the Chairman of the Management Board of the NP "Экспертное Community procurement professionals" Catherine Лезиной, today the state is the most effective customer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Deputy director of the pharmaceutical industry ’ s centre of capital construction Vladimir Malakhov drew attention to the fact that today's market is nominally divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and the companies that hold monopolies competence and does not allow for this field of competitors.</seg>
<seg id="19">He believes that the creation of a transparent market is only possible when access to contracts will be shielded from the effects of someone's manager.</seg>
<seg id="20">The expert council was asked to form a government in such a way that one and the same performer may not receive more than one contract for more than $1 billion rubles, or several contracts worth more than $1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="21">In минстрое believe that this approach must be evaluated from the point of view of the business impact, and effectiveness of construction management.</seg>
<seg id="22">As explained by Elena Zhukova, in this case, it will endow customer functions, which will lead to an increase in the number of customer and budgetary expenditure on its content.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the same time, the customer will need to have the knowledge to assess the quality of its customer organizations, as well as their security.</seg>
<seg id="24">Often when such a breakdown, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the security of an object as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of highly skilled participants in connection with the state in obtaining state indeed on part-time work and a small amount of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="26">The deputy head of the Institute of procurement экспертно-консультационного Alexander Евсташенков believes that right now, the government has turned into a business to Scor contractor.</seg>
<seg id="27">And this example: "A participant when filling in the application shall indicate the" specific performance "without specifying the words" or equivalent "," should "," "," "more," "less than," "similar" "or", "type", "a similar type," "lower," "lower," "higher," "may," "could," "may," "earlier" and "not previously," "higher," "not allowed" and so on.</seg>
<seg id="28">Thus, customers often abused their right to establish requirements for the content of the application of customer organizations.</seg>
<seg id="29">Another problem, according to 44-ФЗ Евсташенкова, was the need to assess the application of the "paper" proposal.</seg>
<seg id="30">An application by a participant, really can be assessed only a qualified contractor, but not the quality of the works, to which not even steps were make, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="31">The quality of the works can be assessed only when their acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="32">The expert was also invited to board a margin income from the top to the bottom, interim contractors have disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="33">Chairman of the Board, and espionage expert at FAS Andrei Цариковский believes that it is not worth it, as responsible for the order should генподрядчик.</seg>
<seg id="34">But otherwise, as in the famous репризе Arkady Raikin normalises sleeping: "Пуговицам claims there?."</seg>

<seg id="3">The house of the 18th century, since the building has not changed, if not considered ветхость.</seg>
<seg id="4">These people are here, as on the tour, and residents are more than delighted, from his privilege - the right to live in the house, the walls of which price старейшем remember commander Alexander Suvorov.</seg>
<seg id="5">The date of construction at home amongst others, historians point to the two dates - 1730 and 1737.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in any case, it turns out that building nearly 300 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The old yard, always open the door, squeaky staircase.</seg>
<seg id="8">Doors in the apartments are located close to each other, the walls of the covers were cracked, and the peeling plaster просветы places visible from the street.</seg>
<seg id="9">It all rests on the honest word.</seg>
<seg id="10">But local residents are told: "You don't think it is."</seg>
<seg id="11">Live in a wooden house of the 18th century is very difficult, "says Tatiana (1961), a resident of apartment # 3.</seg>
<seg id="12">The object is to госохране, but its contents are not allocated the money for dozens of years, and we feel museum artifacts, which the authorities simply have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">The last renovation was 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The walls of the great difficulties is performing well, but the foundation of the entire прогнил.</seg>
<seg id="15">Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, but comes out from shower once a week in a public bath.</seg>
<seg id="16">How can we be satisfied in such conditions?</seg>
<seg id="17">The road passes directly under the windows, even the pedestrian zone.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tatiana post-war curtain.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now see what before was only heard it: The windows of cars.</seg>
<seg id="20">You see, glass дребезжат constantly, can't open a window, and got used to the noise.</seg>
<seg id="21">The same people to invest, to the good and bad.</seg>
<seg id="22">Our apartment is still a top, thanks to her husband, hands him the gold.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, we have two rooms, three of them live with her son.</seg>
<seg id="24">And the other families, the conditions are much worse on the second floor ceiling in a little more than one and a half meters tall.</seg>
<seg id="25">In contrast to Tatiana offers guests the roommate out of the apartment No. 6 Lyudmila Старостиной.</seg>
<seg id="26">A friendly woman with a threshold of a cup of coffee and with a sad smile said:</seg>
<seg id="27">We have a one-bedroom apartment, 14.5 m ² for four people, and we live with her husband and daughter with his granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="28">I am here with the birth, another boundary was never, "Lyudmila обводит eyes: A Special Measures, two sofa the letter" g "; one of them was granddaughter with a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="29">Very closely and differs little from a domestic interior: Only ceilings, beautiful "historical."</seg>
<seg id="30">But the ceiling is regularly flows: Tap system doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lyudmila said about his apartment and at the same time, simply as an Italian, the house which stands on the Roman ruins.</seg>
<seg id="32">We have got one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:</seg>
<seg id="33">Water spent about 40 years ago during the last repair.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the same time we have a tiny kitchen and bathroom in закутке from former self-struggles.</seg>
<seg id="35">We live in a time where квартировал Demidov family lived on the second floor of the servants.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our apartment is privatized, and why?</seg>
<seg id="37">In real estate, the privatization of Ufa said.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still get only a one-bedroom apartment, can't apply for more.</seg>
<seg id="39">Already four months ago, we promised to provide further promises, but it didn't matter.</seg>
<seg id="40">Not used to complain, and I will not.</seg>
<seg id="41">In this apartment (room!) lived for an entire dynasty: My grandparents, my mom and dad, I'm with my husband and my daughter with his granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="42">Things happened during that time.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, doorbell rats ran in the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="44">Look at the walls, they флигеля one-meter wide thickness.</seg>
<seg id="45">The solution, they say, was involved in the eggs, so for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="46">House built thoroughly Демидовым, thank you!</seg>
<seg id="47">Perhaps, just so no one killed a ceiling or сваей.</seg>
<seg id="48">Only construction still slowly dying in front of us: Boards and log house putrefaction, floors have repeatedly failed, we are pouring cement, but all of it - the solution goes into the ground, as well.</seg>
<seg id="49">They say, and is under our room the concealed лаз and move to White, who once lived here, there have to be protected from the danger, in which case.</seg>
<seg id="50">The harassed them.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lyudmila Старостина says, it came as a historian, he begged, he began to shoot in the flat excavations.</seg>
<seg id="52">And then urged to give them housing space in exchange for its однушку in October.</seg>
<seg id="53">Lyudmila historian refused:</seg>
<seg id="54">Where are we in the daily однушку?</seg>
<seg id="55">And here at least a tiny hope is that will give housing.</seg>
<seg id="56">We agree on the exchange, would not have won.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, the family Старостиных nothing and not won.</seg>
<seg id="58">The biggest dream, Ludmila расселили, and daughter with one 16-year-old granddaughter gave a separate room.</seg>
<seg id="59">The two families have identified two-room apartment instead of the majestic ruins, in which two generations living now.</seg>
<seg id="60">Pretty, Olesya Карсакова миниатюрная girl from No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.</seg>
<seg id="61">In two cramped squeezed into airless apartments with a total area of 23 m ², called apartments, lives with her large family.</seg>
<seg id="62">We just seven people, two of them children.</seg>
<seg id="63">See for yourself what kind of conditions.</seg>
<seg id="64">Azerbaijan, as well as pieces of plaster and window frames, the walls in the kitchen, and the cross-cutting holes.</seg>
<seg id="65">The water in the кране only cold year round.</seg>
<seg id="66">Walking about the apartments in the old house, so you can make sure that the most fortunate of spouses Лаврентьевым apartment No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="67">They occupy the most spacious rooms of the first floor.</seg>
<seg id="68">You are right, a lot of places.</seg>
<seg id="69">The 75 square, directed by three people.</seg>
<seg id="70">We live in those rooms, where legend has it stopped police during his stay in Ufa, the head of the family, "said Aleksandr Dmitrievich Lavrentyev.</seg>
<seg id="71">High ceilings, spacious.</seg>
<seg id="72">One bad - all around the train wreck that is collapsing, falling apart.</seg>
<seg id="73">Neighbors probably already told.</seg>
<seg id="74">The more suffering we have with floors, wooden boards сгнили, literally went from under the feet of the ground.</seg>
<seg id="75">I put подпорки, wedges; in the courtroom has nothing, and go in another room, on a seesaw качаемся, so all was not cemented.</seg>
<seg id="76">The merchant house Евдокима Демидова Aleksandr Dmitrievich can tell you better than any guide.</seg>
<seg id="77">Золотопромышленнику refers to the native, speaks of it with admiration.</seg>
<seg id="78">Indeed, the personality and the owner was fantastic: Кагинского Узянского plants built houses, отливал guns and bells, kept уральские mines.</seg>
<seg id="79">Merchants take pride in an ancestor of real estate heirs, but live under one roof with no longer want.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am settled here, even as a child, in the 1940s, of the 20th century, "says Alexander.</seg>
<seg id="81">Then, standing around a wooden barn for / and sentry boxes, subsequently снесенные.</seg>
<seg id="82">In 1968, wanted to remove, and our home, but something prevented.</seg>
<seg id="83">The same story was repeated again in 2014: Поманили new housing.</seg>
<seg id="84">We, as a team, gathered all the necessary documents, обегали, and suddenly learned that moving into apartments in 2015 or 2016.</seg>
<seg id="85">Something already doesn't believe in all this....</seg>
<seg id="86">Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan, to learn the fate of their homes.</seg>
<seg id="87">Officials of the occupier was not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="88">Sent from one desk to another, but then, as mockery, issued without the signature of paper and printing: "The Ministry of Culture is not objecting to the resettlement of the residents."</seg>
<seg id="89">Even though I have a feeling that our house has long been not in terms of the city, because he was under the number 57, then became 57 A, now 57 / 1.</seg>
<seg id="90">As if he had already been demolished in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="91">"A planet" contacted the head of land management sector информационно-аналитической resources Ufa Vladimir Барабашу.</seg>
<seg id="92">A house on the street of the October Revolution, 57 / 1 is included in the resettlement of dilapidated housing.</seg>
<seg id="93">I can't be responsible for the actions of officials in the 1970s, only know that at the time there was a plan for the demolition of old buildings, despite the historical significance.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the authorities - to restore the old house on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value, "successfully.</seg>
<seg id="95">Residents in the near future to provide for new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="96">According to Барабаша, restore House Демидова will be Italian experts who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="97">Now Italy is architectural, and project "Old Ufa" presented there, among others.</seg>
<seg id="98">I hope that by 2016 on the former Old Street will be restored, "the official said.</seg>
<seg id="99">At home, the corresponding gain proper, which was earlier, three centuries ago.</seg>
<seg id="100">House Демидова, is likely to be a museum, open to all comers.</seg>
<seg id="101">In addition, at ministerial level the decision to make the street at the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="102">On weekdays, unfortunately, does not work, too much workload of roads in the city.</seg>
<seg id="103">Provide people from the future museum Vladimir Барабаш promises in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="104">However, it is unlikely that they will be happy with their new apartments will be of the same area, and that the current.</seg>

<seg id="2">Never say, "I love you"</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was one of seven children born to a family of immigrants from Jamaica in Dudley in as in 1958.</seg>
<seg id="4">His father, who died when Henry was 19, he worked in a factory, and their relationship has been limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry репетирует comedy, "Редкие records Rudi," which is partially based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew up in a series of programmes on Radio 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mix of 199.4 and rap, and melodies - жизнерадостны.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, Henry had to work through some difficult memories of childhood.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the death of his mother was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often mused about the relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was very inaccessible.</seg>
<seg id="10">You never saw his face, you only hear his voice: "Don't make noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Отстань from sisters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Шевелись!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch the cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were older, when I was a child, walked with him in the pub and talk about these things, like a glass of beer, the beauty of the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">I have never talked with him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was so неулыбчивым guy in the corner, reading a newspaper which is a big part of my life.</seg>
<seg id="17">Henry recently opened the studio are in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in the days of his father, he was able to take a look at what must have been his life.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now there's a little bit better, but it's dark, дымные have depth of Hell, with outbreaks of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father залезал in a bathtub and just lay there, and you have heard, as he slowly begins to sing about themselves, because he wanted to отмыться mould from the studio.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I came back, I realised that he was doing it years and years in order to earn money for food, and I began to appreciate it more.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nevertheless, Henry came out of a childhood devoid of parental love.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never cuddled, never said, "I love you."</seg>
<seg id="23">It was only when her mother became ill at the end of her life, we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you.</seg>
<seg id="24">The birth of her own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love with which he lacked as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">You can stop it, "I love you"?</seg>
<seg id="26">Just don't hug me!</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I'm 22.</seg>
<seg id="28">With Dawn French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why would I not be friends with her?</seg>
<seg id="30">She's a great mother</seg>
<seg id="31">They are still great friends with the French, to whom he was married for 25 years.</seg>

<seg id="35">Henry was the mother of the diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="36">He was the one that killed her.</seg>
<seg id="37">So, when I was very, very recovered and I had symptoms of diabetes, and my doctor said, "You need to take radical measures.</seg>
<seg id="38">Then I began serious training фитенсом, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="40">And that's boring.</seg>
<seg id="41">No one eats carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">A change of career trajectories of Henry reflected, perhaps, in his noble, briefly подстриженной beard.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he received the recognition for his critics of Othello, he completely immersed in the theatre.</seg>
<seg id="44">It was followed by "Комедия errors," and then "hotel" Огаста Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">This work is different from sitcoms and comedies that were неотъемлимым attribute his busy professional life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He began his career, when he was 16 and had worked at the factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">DJ noticed, as he is a parody on the stage, and wrote about it in "new faces."</seg>
<seg id="48">His career in television began in the mid seventies: "Quite a long time I was the only black пародистом / first on television."</seg>
<seg id="49">He learned on the job.</seg>
<seg id="50">I not only had to grow in the eyes of the public, I had to learn how to be an efficient vehicle for the delivery of jokes between 1975 and 1985, as a star, working on TV, and it was very hard.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny in the "New faces" in 1975</seg>
<seg id="52">As his manager had to show "Black and white minstrels," light entertainment program, in which people "чернили themselves face," Henry found that is in it for five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">My family is a very disliked.</seg>
<seg id="54">I was, like, you want to make sure this never happened to me, but I don't regret that I did it.</seg>
<seg id="55">Though it was a strange, worthy of condemnation position, I worked on large venues and work with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="56">But it was all light entertainment, "the classic British television for years and years," and "grotesque torture black people."</seg>
<seg id="57">Introducing characters who were black men and the culture in the UK, and her perfume, Henry worked in alternative комедийном project in the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="58">The first season of "Show Lenny Henry" was broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as, among other things, the chef of the comedy series "Гэрет Блэклок Шеф!."</seg>
<seg id="59">Commercials, documentaries, TV shows and roles in movies took the following ten years of his life, but after his series on the BBC in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "what are you going to do next, Len, because it seems to me that you're тянешь time or quietly сворачиваешь aside."</seg>
<seg id="60">Next was a series of documentary broadcasts on Radio 4 called "What's good for the...?"</seg>
<seg id="61">The first was about Шекспире.</seg>
<seg id="62">I was allergic to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">That is not to say that I just taught this at school, and I thought that it was, in many ways, a prerogative of white middle class people with колготками and cabbage at the bottom of the front.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I was very afraid of him.</seg>
<seg id="65">All of those we accepted an interview for transmission, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Денч said: "You need to try.</seg>
<seg id="66">Not ругай it as long as you don't know what you are talking about.</seg>
<seg id="67">Произнеси aloud some of these words, and you will understand why we are all so fond of Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry read 20 rows last monologue from Othello for the documentary, and his зацепило.</seg>
<seg id="69">I have the feeling that I can do it.</seg>
<seg id="70">It's like my head выправили.</seg>
<seg id="71">"That's what it is, this is a serious case, Treat seriously style, its text, conduct a study.</seg>
<seg id="72">So, the process of rehearsal was tough, and I read this play for months and months before we put it.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">It seemed that they were waiting for a disaster, but it has not happened.</seg>
<seg id="75">Soon we began "Комедию mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I was at the National Theatre, and I just could not believe it until the end.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you have changed."</seg>
<seg id="78">A technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the audience.</seg>
<seg id="79">"The voice inside me said:" You have to work 10 minutes until they чинят computer. "</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead, the assistant director, announced that the representation will resume as soon as the problem will be solved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I walked away from the scene and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."</seg>
<seg id="82">It's not my responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can't let someone else deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="84">"You're playing in the play, stay in the role."</seg>
<seg id="85">Henry in "заборах Дачесс in theatre."</seg>
<seg id="86">Learn the text for the "Заборов" was difficult.</seg>
<seg id="87">Panic is quite useful, she strengthens muscle.</seg>
<seg id="88">It was good, too, so it was a sign of more than showing: "Here's what you need to do."</seg>
<seg id="89">He says it is, of course, Громовым voice.</seg>
<seg id="90">So I держусь this.</seg>
<seg id="91">I really love it.</seg>
<seg id="92">I love to be in the репетиционном hall.</seg>
<seg id="93">By the way, Henry is still thinking comic - all the way our conversation перебивают flashes his humor, when he starts, it finishes to parody.</seg>
<seg id="94">I just decided not to work in стендапе, because this thing with instant gratification from a room full of strangers, I think is quite dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="95">If you want to that all the time, this can lead to a standstill.</seg>
<seg id="96">I sometimes work in "Прямом broadcast in Apollo, when I want, but, in the main, I don't get so much pleasure as before.</seg>
<seg id="97">I ask, would he give стендапа tour ever.</seg>
<seg id="98">The joy of sitting in a room with the director, who is helping to shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I ever wanted to do.</seg>
<seg id="99">This is his new incarnation?</seg>
<seg id="100">I think so.</seg>
<seg id="101">I like to be an actor.</seg>
<seg id="102">It's pretty fun.</seg>
<seg id="103">You always tell a story, and here is a great place for this.</seg>
<seg id="104">I love history.</seg>

<seg id="2">The weirdest thing about it, it is better to say so, they gradually разваливались as cardboard box, which was left in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="3">But sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, hard, tough, and maybe a little раздражительный.</seg>
<seg id="4">And then she пожимала his hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">He saw in his irritability.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was колючим as hair, yes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The latest victim of this колючести was little novel, from which he was more than usually, lonely and boring life, and perhaps even some satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Эйлинн Соломонз was pulsating with hair and beautiful fragile взлохмаченными трепещущим heart of northern island village, even more remote and harsh than Port Ройбен.</seg>
<seg id="9">She came to the south with спутницей older than themselves, which Кеверн believed her aunt, while the latter was in the house in crude, but the joyous paradise Valley under the name "Райская Valley."</seg>
<seg id="10">No one lived in the house for several years.</seg>
<seg id="11">The pipes were still trickling in the bathtub, spiders, слизни left their footprints on all the windows, confident that the house belongs to them; garden зарос weeds like giant кочаны cabbage.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was like a cottage from a children's book, while at the same time frightening and enchanting, with a garden full of secrets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Opinion of the author: Howard Джейкобсон, whose novel "J" is included in the лонг-лист Букеровской Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">The shortlist will be announced next week</seg>
<seg id="15">Кеверн Эйлинн and sat holding hands, broken sun loungers in the high grass, enjoying surprisingly warm spring day; they both "currently logged on to the console, which provided cheap country music and the Institute of appeasing news, when, looking at the crossed brown legs, he remembered the old song long forgotten black performer, which he loved to listen to his father, curtains in the house.</seg>
<seg id="16">You got big feet too.</seg>
<seg id="17">In view of the inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type on the console does not lose.</seg>
<seg id="18">They were not banned - nothing in fact was not allowed - just not to lose.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have helped to become архаичными, as the word "archaic."</seg>
<seg id="20">Public taste did what would have never managed to achieve orders and regulations, and in the same way as rich people chose among books of memoirs, staying in poverty, cookbooks and love the novels, of all the music they chose ballads.</seg>
<seg id="21">This afternoon, увлекшись Кеверн began playing the piano and ideation crude comic voice praise great legs Эйлинн.</seg>
<seg id="22">Эйлинн not understood.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It was popular to jazz pianist named Фэтс Уоллер," he told her, automatically placing two fingers to his lips.</seg>
<seg id="24">So always did his father to stop the letter "J" before she слетит with his lips.</seg>
<seg id="25">It started with the games they played, when he was small.</seg>
<seg id="26">His father played it with his father, as he told him.</seg>
<seg id="27">Start with "J" word, forgetting to put two fingers to his mouth, and it will cost you, penny.</seg>
<seg id="28">It was not a very fun game then, and it was not very fun right now.</seg>
<seg id="29">He knew that from him for this, that's all.</seg>
<seg id="30">He had to explain what is jazz.</seg>
<seg id="31">Эйлинн never heard.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jazz is playing, even though he was not explicitly prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="33">Improvisation went out of fashion.</seg>
<seg id="34">In life, there was only one "if."</seg>
<seg id="35">When the music started, people wanted to know exactly where it will end.</seg>
<seg id="36">With wit in exactly the same way.</seg>
<seg id="37">His unpredictability had acted on the nerves.</seg>
<seg id="38">But jazz was wit, marked with the help of music.</seg>
<seg id="39">Though he has reached the age of 10 years, never слышав about Sammy Дэвисе Младшем Кеверн, knew about the jazz from the paternal полусекретной коллеции CDs.</seg>
<seg id="40">But at least he did not have to speak Эйлинн that Фэтс Уоллер was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">Given her age, it is unlikely that she remembered a time when popular singers were black.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again, there are no laws or pressure.</seg>
<seg id="43">Society was docile, and this meant that every segment of the agreed with gratitude - the gratitude of those spared the fate of the group, with the principle of predispositions.</seg>
<seg id="44">People афро-карибского origin in temperament and physical characteristics are suitable for the entertainment and sports, and they sang and ran.</seg>
<seg id="45">The Индостана, as if from the nature of the talented in everything that concerned for electronics, and that no family is left without a working phone number online.</seg>
<seg id="46">What remained of the Polish diaspora, has been weaving works; what is left of the Greek, should have a plate.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Gulf states and communities, whose grandfathers did not have to leave the country, when that happened, IF ANY ВООБЩЕ happened happened, in the fear that they were accused of inciting the flame, in fear, actually, that the fire consumes them, have opened restaurants with лабне and not from some people and yearned.</seg>
<seg id="48">Each according to his abilities.</seg>
<seg id="49">As she had heard only Эйлинн ballads, it was hard to understand how offensive words that just sung her Кеверн, could be made to music.</seg>
<seg id="50">The music is an expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">"They are not really offensive," said Кеверн.</seg>
<seg id="52">Except, maybe, for people who have great legs.</seg>
<seg id="53">My father have never offended, but he loved this song.</seg>
<seg id="54">He said too much, but launched a garden gave him the illusion of security.</seg>
<seg id="55">No word could not penetrate the pallet giant leaves similar to капустные.</seg>
<seg id="56">Эйлинн still did not understand.</seg>
<seg id="57">As your father could love this?</seg>
<seg id="58">He wanted to say that this is a joke, but he does not like when her прижимать two fingers to his lips again.</seg>
<seg id="59">She had already thought it strange.</seg>
<seg id="60">"It was funny," he said instead.</seg>
<seg id="61">She shook her head, clearly close Кеверну review.</seg>
<seg id="62">There was nothing in the whole world, except копны иссиня-черных her hair.</seg>
<seg id="63">Nothing, that he would like to watch.</seg>
<seg id="64">"Well, if you say it," she said, in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="65">But this still does not explain why I sing it.</seg>
<seg id="66">She seemed really upset.</seg>
<seg id="67">I have too big feet?</seg>
<seg id="68">He looked at them again.</seg>
<seg id="69">You cannot say no.</seg>
<seg id="70">Ankles, maybe a little bit....</seg>
<seg id="71">And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?</seg>
<seg id="72">I hate you?</seg>
<seg id="73">Of course, I don't hate you.</seg>
<seg id="74">It's just this stupid song.</seg>
<seg id="75">He could say: "I love you," but it was too early.</seg>
<seg id="76">"I like you very much because you have thick ankles", tried to say he instead.</seg>
<seg id="77">I have such a distortion.</seg>
<seg id="78">It was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="79">He wanted to, so it was funny.</seg>
<seg id="80">Attempts by the joke often made him awkward situation, because, like his father, he was missing the soothing charm that could mitigate the cruelty, крывшуюся in charge.</seg>
<seg id="81">Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.</seg>
<seg id="82">Maybe he, Кеверн, wanted.</seg>
<seg id="83">Despite the good eye.</seg>
<seg id="84">Эйлинн Соломонз blushed and stood up with the referral, the console and the wine that they drank.</seg>
<seg id="85">The wine is from, so that drugs could serve as an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="86">In his excitement, it seemed, she was trembling, like пальмовые leaves in the weather system.</seg>
<seg id="87">"I like you very much because you amounts to pointless head," she said.</seg>
<seg id="88">Although not like you very much.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was sorry for her and because of the excessive brutality of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she gave it to him.</seg>
<seg id="90">Whether she thought that he hit her?</seg>
<seg id="91">She has not talked to him about life on the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he has no doubt that the basic it was similar to the здешнюю.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same huge icy ocean befell them both.</seg>
<seg id="93">The same man, and even more sensitive and accused after that happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened than their ancestors, smugglers and разрушители, shopped in fury from pub to pub, ready to raise a hand on any woman, or to deny them посмевшую поддразнить them.</seg>
<seg id="94">Amounts to pointless head?</seg>
<seg id="95">They would have shown her a fist, if she was not cautious.</seg>
<seg id="96">Would be first kissed, kiss now became the most common erotic expression of irritation between a man and a woman; an antidote to the fresh, which Google is the first to kiss her, and then hit.</seg>
<seg id="97">Excessive clarification, according to Кеверна because the kiss itself was already DVD films.</seg>
<seg id="98">Эйлинн Соломонз case showed that he needs to leave.</seg>
<seg id="99">He rose from the referral, as an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She felt the lead weight, but the weight of his grief surprised her.</seg>
<seg id="101">This was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They barely knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">She looked, as he goes, and at the top of the window, as he leaves, her companion, a man, himself at взваливший themselves.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam, the outgoing garden, she thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">She felt a stab of sympathy towards him and men in general, even though some of them and raised her hand.</seg>
<seg id="106">The man, from the pulpit, отвернувшийся, пристыженный сраженный, the ability to fight left him - why she felt she knew so well, if she could not recall a single case, until today, when she saw it?</seg>
<seg id="107">Again one Эйлинн Соломонз looked at their feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">Twenty years before the above events or so Эсме Нуссбаум, intelligent and energetic 32-летняя исследовательница, which worked in "Офнау", an informal service control over Community mood, has prepared a report on the saving low and middle level of violence in most parts of the country, where it was expected that it will be reduced, if not lifted entirely, given the money and power, which were allocated to its eradication.</seg>
<seg id="109">"A lot has been done, and a lot is being done," she wrote, "in order to mitigate an inherent aggressiveness of people who fought in a war and won most of them, especially among these спутанных branches and narrow расселин area, where, despite the insulation over изгородями spires of churches, gentle breathing human kindness was rarely in history.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, some quality, it turns out, неискоренимы.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher the spire, it would seem, the низменнее those passions that he зарождает.</seg>
<seg id="112">People shed tears over the sentimental skipping for stories about преодоленных obstacles and announces its overheated faith in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness retains its strong grip as in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is evidence that is new, and a vile задиристость in homes, in the workplace, on roads and even in playgrounds.</seg>
<seg id="113">"You have досадная habit of writing too much," said her supervisor, read the report as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="114">I think you should read shorter novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">Эсме Нуссбаум lowered his head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask you: You атеистка?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I think that is not obliged to answer," replied Эсме Нуссбаум.</seg>
<seg id="118">Are you gay?</seg>
<seg id="119">Эсме again insisted on his right to privacy and silence.</seg>
<seg id="120">Feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Again, silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I ask," said Luther Рабиновиц, "not because I am against atheism, лесбийства or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">There is no prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="124">We are the servants of society without prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="125">But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely reasonable and a good in themselves, they may sometimes distort the results, such as, for example, those that you showed me.</seg>
<seg id="126">It is obvious that you yourself предубеждены against the Church, and what you call "malevolent" and "rude", others would be interpreted as an expression of natural and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="127">To continue the нудеть IN THAT happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened, as if it happened, if it happened yesterday, it means depriving the country needed her life force.</seg>
<seg id="128">Эсме Нуссбаум огляделась around until Рабиновиц said.</seg>
<seg id="129">Over his head, as well as pink, led the letters repeat suggestions that "Офнау" gave the country the last quarter of a century or more.</seg>
<seg id="130">His neighbour, улыбайся value of his spouse, listen to ballads, demonstrations, talk on the phone, listen, communicate, pulls, соглашайся, извиняйся.</seg>
<seg id="131">The conversation is better than silence, word of the song better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I fully understand that you want to say," quietly replied Эсме Нуссбаум, when satisfied that her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I don't want to say nothing, except that he was not as efficiently as we convince ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">I am concerned about is that if we do not, we will find that repeat mistakes, which initially led to the ТОМУ ВООБЩЕ IF THAT happened, happened.</seg>
<seg id="134">Only this time we выбросим their anger and distrust the other.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Рабиновиц joined the tips of fingers in the cut.</seg>
<seg id="136">That gesture was supposed to mean an infinite patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"You go too far," he said, "calling" mistakes "actions that made or not made our grandfathers.</seg>
<seg id="138">You go too far and when talking about what they threw away their "anger" and "mistrust" in the "other."</seg>
<seg id="139">In your place, people should not need since then about the fact that, in the past, the present, we are not talking about "us" and "them."</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "us" and no "other."</seg>
<seg id="141">It was the time of the disorder - and that's all that we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"For which, to be honest with ourselves," dare insert Эсме, "no part of society may well justify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am not accusing anyone.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it's bad or good, what is done is done.</seg>
<seg id="145">Then it was back then.</seg>
<seg id="146">You don't need to say anything more, we agree.</seg>
<seg id="147">And don't blame anyone, not excuses, and if this was appropriate, or if it was something to be corrected.</seg>
<seg id="148">But why, if not to learn "</seg>
<seg id="149">Past существет to ensure that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I can add to that one word -</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther's Great Pyramid Рабиновица had collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I'll review your report," he said, and dismissed her.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, on the way to work, her off, who rode on the sidewalk мотоциклист, described how passers-by, "the vicious rage."</seg>

<seg id="2">Growth in the eurozone slowed to the lowest level in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.</seg>
<seg id="3">The business index (PMI) for the eurozone manufacturing sector public fell to 50.7 in August, dropping from 51.8 in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">The above 50 indicates growth.</seg>
<seg id="5">New orders and businesses affected by the rising tension between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The values were received before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Markets will wait for the bank from a clear plan of how to cope with stopping the eurozone recovery, as well as the threat of deflation, with inflation of just 0.3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation that Mario Draghi, the head of the ECB later this week may give further signals that he is considering quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone, similar to those used by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Although some growth is better than no growth, a braking effect of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on the manufacturers becomes more obvious," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at public.</seg>
<seg id="10">The manufacturing sector PMI in Germany, a major trade partner of Russia in the EU, has fallen to the lowest level in 11 months of 51.4.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the meantime, the bloc's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to italian).</seg>

<seg id="15">One positive news from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.</seg>
<seg id="16">Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that can be said about the August survey index of business activity in the eurozone manufacturing sector, is that it shows that the sector is still growing."</seg>
<seg id="17">He added: "Eurozone manufacturers, obviously, are finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension - particularly associated with the Russia / Ukraine, adds uncertainty still difficult conditions in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">This increasing tension, apparently hit by business - and especially on the confidence of consumers, and is likely to lead to the fact that some orders are delayed, or even cancelled, especially large orders.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said that "increasingly likely" that the ECB, of course, will have to conduct some kind of quantitative easing, "although we suspect that it will be limited."</seg>

<seg id="55">We would never say that they killed or dead.</seg>
<seg id="56">We say that they stayed in the gym.</seg>
<seg id="57">I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy shop, where I was allowed to choose what I wanted, and a trip in the car with you.</seg>
<seg id="58">But now he is afraid for such places as Ukraine, where war causes such grief, which survived, he and his friends.</seg>
<seg id="59">This horror comes back to you every day, but I would like to think that I could no longer remember his</seg>
<seg id="60">"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who in the past week, was doing volunteer work in a women's monastery.</seg>

<seg id="65">She vividly remembers his trip with Дамиром in London.</seg>
<seg id="66">People in London cried when I told our story.</seg>

<seg id="68">She was grateful to "Sheri Blair and its Fund for the award and the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="69">I would like to call the composer and simply to say that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting with her and her husband in London and how they helped Дамиру and me.</seg>
<seg id="70">I remember when Damir wanted to eat, they rang up all the local Russian restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="71">I remember how he played with Scherer in the restaurant, Damir shot them from his water pistol, and they flee and played with him.</seg>
<seg id="72">And only one month has passed since our nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="73">I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and to support us.</seg>
<seg id="74">She said: "I think that the world is no better over these 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="75">Now in Ukraine there is a war, people are dying every day, and I think many children have been killed and would be killed.</seg>
<seg id="76">It's just the same as our children.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think for many people, war is a news broadcast, that they listen to when they get bored or when they are busy with something else.</seg>
<seg id="78">I just know that these people feel, the horror of it.</seg>
<seg id="79">And I can't stop feeling it.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.</seg>
<seg id="81">Damir grew up and became very soft and quiet as a boy, he's not an aggressive and angry.</seg>
<seg id="82">He is not looking for revenge, for example, he did not just fixed on it in this last nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not like to remember it, but they are very close with six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and burn candles there.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was younger, he suffered from this, I remember, as he lay on the couch, and away from us.</seg>
<seg id="85">Did not sleep, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys. Дамиру now 17, he was above me, nice, smart and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that a few hours I was so sure that he died, and that I will never see him no more.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I was able to recover from the explosion and rose to his feet, I огляделась, I saw hell around himself, when parts of bodies were lying everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely sure that it is not possible to my little boy could survive in this hell.</seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember what I shouted to him:" Damir, Run, убегай ", but again I was so sure that he had not heard.</seg>
<seg id="91">But he heard, and ran off.</seg>
<seg id="92">So life goes on for us, unlike so many others.</seg>

<seg id="94">The boy, whose shocking photo after capture was decisive for the Beslan tragedy</seg>
<seg id="95">Peace: Surviving Beslan George Ilyin with their mother, Fatima after his capture in 2004, and to the right of Georgy today</seg>
<seg id="96">On his bloody face was a mark of fear, when he were fleeing from death, when Chechen terrorists were shot his classmates.</seg>
<seg id="97">His photograph was one of the most shocking character barbarism in Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="98">His mother Fatima, 54, the chief doctor, enrolled him in the school on the first day of school, before moving to the eldest son of Vladimir in the university.</seg>
<seg id="99">"I went away for two minutes before the terrorists ran into the courtyard, so that my little boy was left alone on the three days of nightmare," she recalled.</seg>
<seg id="100">Not just one, there was the family of our relatives, but they were all killed.</seg>
<seg id="101">Only because I managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="102">The closer the date, the more difficult to think and speak about it.</seg>
<seg id="103">There is not a single day when we won't remember this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="104">We do not think that it was a long time ago, I think it was yesterday, some scenes all the time these days before my eyes.</seg>
<seg id="105">No one will never forget, I promise you.</seg>
<seg id="106">The западает: George (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was увековечена sculpture (right)</seg>
<seg id="107">I remember George just wanted to go to school that day, said that he wants to hug a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="108">I only found out that he was alive when I saw him on TV.</seg>
<seg id="109">And now even have the sculpture crying George in San Marino.</seg>
<seg id="110">George doesn't like to look at this picture, and it is hidden in a cupboard at home.</seg>
<seg id="111">I understand, but I also think that the photos of people from all around the world feel our pain.</seg>
<seg id="112">George says now: "It is important that this never happened.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I doubt that we ever learn the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">People continue to investigate this tragedy and will never know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">Now they are investigating the Boeing crashed in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Will we ever know what it was called?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world is going to something very bad.</seg>
<seg id="118">"I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, because it is happening?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing for this pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need to have a little bit of tens of years to forget it.</seg>
<seg id="121">It has affected my health, and I still feel it.</seg>
<seg id="122">About three or four years of nightmares because of me, but now it became better.</seg>
<seg id="123">I returned to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.</seg>
<seg id="124">I thought about my friends and haunted, who were killed.</seg>

<seg id="139">At the time, he was in the gym nearly sitting next to a bomb at the feet of террориста-убийцы.</seg>
<seg id="140">Indeed, it is a miracle that he was not killed.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It seems to us that it was yesterday," says Giorgi, who wanted to learn from the intelligence officer in the FSB, but couldn't because of the damage that was caused by his health at the time of the capture.</seg>

<seg id="168">He remains with us.</seg>
<seg id="169">George, now an adult, but the nightmare was still with him.</seg>
<seg id="170">It's hard to take when something so terribly unfair, happens to you.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was a boy, he loves the sport, but I can't do this because of the knee.</seg>
<seg id="172">He had several operations, he can walk, but cannot exercise.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say that he was 50% more this nightmare, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.</seg>

<seg id="177">My son with me, and this is the best gift that God could I do, but my heart aches for those who had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know the family, where the children were born, but I know and widows who never married.</seg>
<seg id="179">It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips, how to achieve a better quality of underwater photos and video</seg>
<seg id="2">If you want to take pictures or video underwater, you have a number of options.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is waterproof "мыльница", for example, the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or, for example, GoPro Hero3 экшн-камера + Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I took these pictures on a family holiday with the help of a few cameras, all for the price of about $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">No matter what equipment you are using, you need to comply with several regulations, in order to achieve the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Перепроверяйте their equipment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera case and other branches of the tightly closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, set up their camera for the type of photos or videos that you shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some of the photos and video cameras there were shooting or type of object that optimise exposure for mages underwater conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in the water, look at how deep your equipment can fall.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are only 5 feet, others - 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Take a look at our guide to the buyer and digital cameras for both traditional and advance models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Remove a few frames - because many of them will never get.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Essentially" LCD that can help you assign images, whereas the экшн-камер them usually don't.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have LCD, it will be difficult to see under the water, and the frame is a random process.</seg>
<seg id="16">So do a few frames.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also, if your camera is serial shooting mode, which takes several shots with a slightly different view, use them.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">The amount of light is significantly reduced, the deeper you нырнете under water.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, stay at the surface, when you're shooting in the pool, the river or the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">It also allows you to transmit more colors in the photos; the deeper you get far less color you see.</seg>
<seg id="22">Подплывайте closer to objects.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is a great tip for shooting on the land, but it is even more important under the water because of the mages light conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is especially important if you're shooting on экшн-камеру: This equipment often comes with a fixed, широкоугольной lens, which means that you have to get closer to the object of filming, if you want to fill the frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was such a man, whose force of personality could shake things around, even in such a giant organization like the National Health Service.</seg>
<seg id="2">Консультирующий anaesthetist, he has devoted his career redemption as patients suffering from the disease, and of encouraging treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among those who spoke to him, recalls his wife, was an MI6 officer who had to live with devastating effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that, until the doctors involved being diagnosed and diseases, those who are being treated, mainly worried about something else -- the pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, however, he proved those who began to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I never felt, as usual," he wrote in May last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was hard to find the strength within themselves.</seg>
<seg id="8">Struggling with symptoms similar to flu, he found that irritated reproaches his wife, Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want all happened sooner rather than later," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Juliet left for a week, Lawson found that unusual and it is not clear why he was upset.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked a colleague to chest X-rays.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks before he went skiing in the French Alps.</seg>
<seg id="14">The results of the X-rays came.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was mesothelioma, a terminal cancer, which affects плевру, or the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="16">For most cancers, it is difficult to determine the exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although some people became ill with cancer of the lungs, for example, not all patients develop lung cancer smoked.</seg>
<seg id="18">But with mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, grainy construction material, which was once called the "miracle," but which, as we now know, deadly dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us is disease mesothelioma, which can be not to pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos, in the end, is the stuff from the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in the UK since the 1960s, when these industrial ban came into force.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even when it has been used, only people from specific sectors worked in close contact with him: Трубоизолировщики, builders, carpenters and the situation, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">Industrial toxin from another era, he is hardly a cause for concern today.</seg>
<seg id="25">But such a calm.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it turns out, is now at the peak of the epidemic мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="27">Here мезотелиомы dies from more people than in any other country on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the annual mortality of about 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease than as a result of road accidents.</seg>
<seg id="29">The annual number of deaths from мезотелиомы since 1980 and projected in the future, the number of deaths in the UK</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason we feel its deadly consequences right now, lies in the fact that, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), for the development of мезотелиомы go usually tens of years.</seg>
<seg id="31">And the problem is not limited to veterans мезотелиомы specialties industrial construction.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was and, in many cases, remains in the house where we live, where we work, schools, where we learn, and shops, where we go shopping.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention in class, the level of income, profession or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">Избранности bastions of the fashionable London department stores to private schools, as it turned out, not salvation.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parliament building is riddled with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even hospitals that are meant to treat us, turned out to be reservoirs of this fatal a carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was not трубоизолировщиком.</seg>
<seg id="39">In fact, he had to think about where he could enter into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he realized.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It seems that could be a lot of asbestos in tunnels in the hospital Guy, where I spent six years in," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">All are students, nurses, doctors and persons - used these тоннелями.</seg>
<seg id="43">I wonder how many of my peers expect the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">It was a question to which, unfortunately, he was able to give a partial response.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Of the four doctors, which we in the hospital and have subsequently Guy developed mesothelioma for the past five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I alone remained alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us expect this disease?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Лоусону was diagnosed with mesothelioma, "" when he was 48 years old.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">To live so long.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty percent of patients die from mesothelioma eight months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is always fatal.</seg>
<seg id="52">So, now, we can only repeat Лоусона question: "How many of us expect this disease?"</seg>
<seg id="53">According to a leading expert in the UK, Professor Джулиану мезотелиоме Пито, most likely assume that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK must first source, by a man about to die.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most now are that they die that way.</seg>

<seg id="56">A quick review of reports from the court, where victims are often seek compensation, shows how far it has spread attack мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="57">In June, for example, Marks & Spencer, who have acknowledged that Джэнис Ellen contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, a plethora of clothing departments at two sites, one of which was the store on Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs Ellen was just 18 years old, when she started working at M & S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now her two children older than 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Before this happened," she says, "I've never heard of мезотелиоме, I barely knew about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="62">Me in the head and could not have come, that's me.</seg>
<seg id="63">Few people really know a lot about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="64">In fact, asbestos is not one substance, and a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">They get their name from the word "асбестиформ", which means the fibrous structure that informs them strength and flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="66">Of those six, three were often used in the construction.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotile asbestos, widely known as white, more often found in other buildings today.</seg>
<seg id="68">It has been used in roofing panels, напольной granite industry, pipes, boilers, even in brake колодках cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">He смертелен less than other forms of asbestos, but still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization "serious source of health damage, which can lead to death.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, brown asbestos (амозит) and blue asbestos (крокидолит).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts believe that there are good, though indirect reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with mesothelioma [in the UK]. "</seg>
<seg id="72">An employee of Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the main store on London's Oxford Street, with</seg>
<seg id="73">Джэнис Ellen may not have thought of yourself as a victim, but Julian Пито мезотелиомы work suggests that her story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that a significant percentage of мезотелиом when there is no known exposure at work or at home, were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment. "</seg>
<seg id="75">Much of this impact, he says, is "a normal use and exposure to weather" in our building.</seg>
<seg id="76">No one, it seems, can't be sure that he is safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">The report Goddard Consulting, which was Вестминстерский Palace, demonstrates how people, even in the heart of government, may have been exposed to unconsciously.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009, Goddard said that technical mines and pipelines for the premises of parliamentary committees were infected with deadly asbestos fibres, which may have given the movement of something as harmless as "strong currents of air."</seg>
<seg id="79">Members of the parliament often blame the fact that they are pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.</seg>
<seg id="80">Although the Directorate for the maintenance of Parliament insisted that Вестминстерский Palace received a "clean bill of health," and now she recognized that it is necessary to work on the £1 billion for the reconstruction of the parliament, by upgrading electrician and removing asbestos, and that after the general election in 2015, the members of the parliament, will meet in the conference centre close to participate, and not related to the green benches.</seg>
<seg id="81">The report Goddard said that "the situation with asbestos is not Poland, in accordance with the various rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">It is impossible to know whether this error management cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All I can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">One of those who have not managed to identify his contact with asbestos, cost is Graham, general practitioner.</seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson, cost, 50 years, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I was in the hospital, which has successfully brought claims associated with asbestos," he says, "But I can't prove this in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It's so hard to remember all the places, where he worked, and dates.</seg>
<seg id="88">He remembers clearly, so this day in early December 2009, when his wholly overcame something that was like the flu.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly were shaken as me.</seg>
<seg id="91">It started very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terrible.</seg>
<seg id="93">I thought that I would not be able to drive all the way to homes.</seg>
<seg id="94">Cost of being a doctor, knew the pain comes from, including checking for iframe loads, shell around the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="95">However, like Джэнис Ellen, he just did not have reason to suspect мезотелиому.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the end, he couldn't walk for a month.</seg>
<seg id="97">US doctors doing chest x-rays and плевральные катетеры to pull fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis.</seg>
<seg id="98">And yet his condition оставлось without a diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">Gradually, his health has improved, and he returned to work.</seg>
<seg id="100">But from time to time, those same symptoms return, often after he engaged in sports, and he breathed heavily.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, one of the patients came to him in the Dubai office with similar symptoms, and he was later diagnosed with mesothelioma. ""</seg>
<seg id="102">Even then, however, cost is not linked it with its own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">In the end, his patient was in the tens of years older and worked with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">In this case, the connection was obvious.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011, the state of Dubai has worsened again, and his doctor консультировавший showed it the results of the CT and X-ray images of the group of experts.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, just two years after cost began to feel ill, sensor, equipped with a camera, was introduced in the cavity between the shell of his shell of his chest and lung.</seg>
<seg id="107">I'm an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I usually just go further, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="109">I'm not too upset about it, to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife, experienced.</seg>
<seg id="111">The biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that it was mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham: Cost of diagnosed with mesothelioma</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly cost sank in meeting with Macmillan nurses, one of which suggested he contact a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">It was then that he realised the scale of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turns out that asbestos is widely used, especially in large public buildings, and where quite often there was asbestos once on the pipes," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, now get sick with this disease.</seg>
<seg id="117">Thus, mesothelioma now affects more young people нетипичных professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous isolated asbestos pipes in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees who were crossing the tunnels connecting nearby landmasses can bring together to get from one building to another (as Andrew Lawson), or ate in the basements of canteens (how often did Graham cost) almost certainly really were exposed to toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">For several decades after the war, it turns out that the hospital was a place where, in theory, legalistic поциентов for life, but the place, which constituted a threat to life for doctors who treated them.</seg>
<seg id="121">It still continues to remove today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students set their burners Бунзена асбестовые on tap</seg>
<seg id="123">And it's not just hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos is often used in offices, shops, libraries and мэриях because of his amazing insulating and огнестойких characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="125">Schools too.</seg>
<seg id="126">In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the classroom for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="127">Across the country, countless chemistry lessons, students set their burners Бунзена асбестовые on tap.</seg>
<seg id="128">Appeared on websites, Ad problem of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as floor tiles or roof сараев usually contained asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"This is an industrial poison, in a huge number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Лоусона in a case against the hospital Guy.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case, the only contact that could remember diseased woman, was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So be careful, снося garden sheds.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effect of the diagnosis, when we know that the disease is incurable, is huge.</seg>
<seg id="134">"To realize it, is quite a lot of time," says Graham cost.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to continue, but realized that I could not focus on what I'm doing.</seg>
<seg id="136">I spent two weeks in surgery.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I realized that I have to go and deal with them.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I don't meet Christmas</seg>
<seg id="139">One of the most difficult things was the transition from doctor to patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">As countless patients before him, he was shot down, as the volume of information that should have been.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was difficult to understand," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked his doctor" how many I have time? "</seg>
<seg id="143">Gave me about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember, as I thought, "Well, I don't meet Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's all. "</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, as it is the mechanics of how we are in life, "the very act of breathing, raises cancer, which kills.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases are caused by contact with asbestos мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos is composed of tiny fibers.</seg>
<seg id="149">When collapses and carcinogenic asbestos fibers, they can get stuck in the плевре, shell.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibers are annoying плевру and can cause mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem is due to the inhalation of asbestos fibres needle," Professor Tom Трежер кардиоторакальный, surgeon, who came to the hospital in 2001, Guy.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is the hospital, where, as suspected, Andrew Lawson, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="153">Трежер knew Лоусона and treated some of the others who, perhaps, IALD member firms have access to in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">When Sally Goodin Sally goodun Etc lyrics of asbestos in the lung tissue, "says Трежер," breathing them unload on the periphery, where the shell.</seg>
<seg id="155">It is, in essence, invasive process from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="156">Conventional treatments of other forms of cancer is much less effective at мезотелиоме.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, is controversial.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some think it's worth a try.</seg>
<seg id="159">Трежер disagrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">"You can't cut плевру," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">It around her employees with a knife.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, the cancer is "not a very good defense," which "acts", but not people.</seg>
<seg id="163">"From time to time there are patients who live a long time," says Трежер.</seg>
<seg id="164">But in the end, they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some patients are living much, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">Writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after he was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years after diagnosis, Graham cost continues to fight.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he became ill from mesothelioma, Dubai introduced Andrew Лоусоном, which, four years after diagnosis, single-handedly turned into the desk support and advice for patients.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Yes, Раковая Central," he said, cheerfully when they called.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," says cost.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was diagnosed four years ago, and he still is very energetic.</seg>
<seg id="172">First Эбботту offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and would have prolonged his life only a month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was in despair," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, managed to somewhat more positive agenda. "</seg>
<seg id="176">Meeting with several specialists, decided to continue the treatment cost with Professor Лоиком Ланж-Лаздунски, professor of surgery at the hospital used Guy.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had the advantage that I don't need it, I just called them and they took me," admits Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">The consultants would have to get the direction and approval for funding.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money plays a decisive role for patients with mesothelioma, in order to get the best available treatments.</seg>
<seg id="180">But when such treatments become ineffective, finally, inevitably, many patients are facing another financial reason for concern "about the future of families that they would leave.</seg>
<seg id="181">And then they ask the courts for compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan, of Field Fisher at LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It has been known that asbestos is harmful to human health, since 1898," said Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But that changed in the 1960s, is that it became clear that even very small amounts of could expose health risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">It was then spoke about the bad faith.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson, and Guy's Hospital, ultimately, resolve the case, but it was not "the full cost of the settlement," according to Morgan, as Lawson could not clearly prove that his mesothelioma was the result of exposure to asbestos at Guy Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation into his death, a spokesman for the hospital, Guy is confirmed, however, that "asbestos in its basement, mentioned above, was removed in the 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="188">It was too late for Andrew Лоусона.</seg>
<seg id="189">How to remove asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">In fact, tie deadly contact with asbestos to one company or place of work - usually through dozens of years after that, it turned out to be a big problem for patients with mesothelioma, demanding compensation.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have changed the owner or shut down.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance archives could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who are protected from lawsuits, know that time is on their side, the plaintiffs, of course, no.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, this year took serious new legislative acts which facilitate the recovery of patients with mesothelioma compensation, even if it is impossible to keep track of their former employers.</seg>
<seg id="195">In accordance with the law, was created by £350-миллионный fund of funds, which is financed by the insurance industry, for those who had been diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove to the contact, but not anyone with whom to sue.</seg>
<seg id="196">In such cases, patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in a case about the compensation - about £giant.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful claims under this scheme is expected to be every year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with mesothelioma, believes that the £350 million represent a "very good work" for the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"This transaction, which insured for insurers," he says, hinting that the sum is a quarter of that insurers would have to pay if they had not intervened time and patients with mesothelioma could track the company and file a lawsuit in the usual way.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even Mike Пеннинг, previously minister for work and pensions, acknowledged that the law "imperfect."</seg>
<seg id="201">However, Пеннинг, and Morgan acknowledged that, in view of the fact that seven people die every day, rapid action was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="202">"People suffer so much, and they need help now," said Пеннинг during the second reading of the Bill about мезотелиоме in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">By the time Graham cost was in the hands of Professor Лоика Ланж-Лаздунски 19 months.</seg>
<seg id="204">After the initial consultation Ланж-Лаздунски recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Трежера, he believes to be effective.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was followed by radiation and chemotherapy - тритерапия, in which entire Ланж-Лаздунски boasts 40 per cent of patients surviving for five years.</seg>
<seg id="206">Cost of felt a surge of strength.</seg>
<seg id="207">"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says cost.</seg>
<seg id="208">You see these patients all the time.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is a force that supports you.</seg>
<seg id="210">When сдаешься, can deteriorate very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham went to the cost of the operation in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">By the end of August he finished last of six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">The scan showed no trace of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had a scan in March [2014].</seg>
<seg id="215">There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I just had to be 50.</seg>
<seg id="217">This is not a threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="218">This is the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="219">Again, the cost went through six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now there is no trace of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="221">However, this process is both physically and emotionally heavy.</seg>
<seg id="222">You can think about practical things - about finance, when I die, for example, or that we need to show his wife, works as a timer on a big PRB.</seg>
<seg id="223">When you get bad news, you become безрадостным.</seg>
<seg id="224">You need to look forward.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose their leaders; protesters promise revenge</seg>
<seg id="2">China's parliament decided Sunday to not allow Hong Kong voters nominate candidates in the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reforms.</seg>
<seg id="3">Such a move is likely to mark the beginning of a long time ago promised protests in Hong Kong as activists have begun planning and mobilization in a matter of hours after that statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the 11th National People's Congress, in fact, communist leaders to remove all the candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's not обмануло our expectations, but still leads in rage," said legislator Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's not that Beijing had promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">They lied to people in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defending the decision of China, Li Fey, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the 11th National People's Congress, said that to allow public nomination for Hong Kong's leadership elections, it would be too "find."</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing promised to allow residents of the region to choose the head of government by voting, starting in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chinese leaders have made the decision as a democratic step forward, since it gives a direct vote гонконгцам right; however, the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold in his hands with the help of the Commission on the appointment of candidates, rigidly controlled from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, according to a new article that only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be admitted.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision was taken after the summer, when there have been some of the most ambitious and have received broad publicity protests in Hong Kong for many years.</seg>
<seg id="14">For a large part of the campaign after Occupy Central movement in Hong Kong is With Love and Peace, which threatened to block the financial district in Hong Kong if Beijing does not guarantee of universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday evening, a few hours after the declaration, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the demonstration, the organizers claimed that their movement is shifting to a new phase of civil disobedience and that they rise up on the waves of protest in the next few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, they have not reported the details, apparently in an effort to avoid problems with government bodies.</seg>
<seg id="18">In онлайн-заявлении, the organizers said the movement "to capture the central region обдумывало only as exceptional measures, actions that can be taken only if all the possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We regret that today, all possibilities have been exhausted and the seizure of the central district of dialogue will take place.</seg>
<seg id="20">Authorities in Hong Kong to Beijing for a few days, and on Sunday the government had strengthened security measures with the help of police and barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">The unrest is the feeling of many in Hong Kong, they slowly lose control over their own city.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of residents from mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also increases fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some have criticized the movement Occupy Central demonstrations, saying that it put at risk business - the lifeblood of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protest, which they say, it could cause great economic damage, depending on how many people will participate and for how long," said the legislator, Regina Yip, who has long been critical of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="26">We don't want to spread concern about the fact that Hong Kong can spin out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This view, which is harmful for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chinese state media also gave reports in recent days, in which the activists of the democratic movement were гонконгские houses, направляемыми Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral law, which drew 780000 participants - more than one-fifth of voters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in July, tens of thousands took to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists are raising the issue of race and the conduct of the police after Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">Unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Фергюсоне, Missouri, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">Coming raise hands, chanting: "Hands up, don't стреляй", while they are waiting in the queue.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Missouri Фергюсоне, associated with the murder of teenager Michael Brown, change blogger Miriam зоила Perez noticed the shift in интернет-разговоре among white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">In her experience, the white feminists stamps comments put gender above race, when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, as tensions rose in the Midwest and attracted national attention, Peres saw the white women who is 100 percent focused on the race.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared with the reaction of black women shortly after the killing on 9 August, personal essays with such titles as "thoughts about Фергюсоне on behalf of a white woman" and "Феминизм is not only about the Savings ampamp women" appeared relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Perez, they demonstrated a significant shift.</seg>
<seg id="9">"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who are talking about white skin and Privileges on such a high level," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People feel the need to say something about what has happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is a very symbolic for the crisis with which we are faced, and because of the situation in the Фергюсоне) is so tied to race, they feel that these should be.</seg>
<seg id="12">For Professor of English at the University of Ohio Кориты Mitchell Ferguson laid bare problems that blacks face every day, but one which is not perceived as a "women's problems" in the cultural sphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can write something funny on Facebook about what was going on with me and my partner and get 150 лайков from everywhere," says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">When I write something about how the colored people are attacked in his own country, silence clearly.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Why do women safely publicly talking about the relationship, but not about the security in the public sector?" She asks.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women, like Mitchell, who studied the issues of race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between matters relating to race and gender.</seg>
<seg id="17">From her point of view, blacks, women are in a position to clearly separate the problems; they are faced with a complex reality every day.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women now bring together issues of race and gender in feminist мейнстриме, Энджела Хэттери, a professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that its predecessor did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 1865 and 1890 линчевали for years, at least 10,000 black men, and it is almost always served as the rape of white women," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="20">Need a white woman, proves the story to motivate people.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the point of view of Хэттери, the gap between white and black women, a white when you have, for example, Susan B. Anthony looked at the situation in the late 1800s, and saw that the fight for suffrage will be effective only for one of the groups: Women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They decided to lay all the eggs in the basket of the voting rights for women, and the right to vote for blacks would appear later," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="23">To look back on this kind of thing gives us a clear idea of why colored women don't trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have not done anything good.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women united against mob lynchings in the Women's Association for the prevention of mob lynchings of the South.</seg>
<seg id="27">This group has nearly 40 years after blacks for the first time women were asked to help, said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">From the point of view of Mitchell, the reactions of white feminists on the issues raised in the conduct of the police, "Фергюсоне, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white a feminist had to" catch up "problems that blacks, women справлялись in several generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"However, it would be fine, if female, which have such a [traditional феминистическая] ideology, so seriously would be to raise a child, as they relate to the right to contraception?" Asked Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="30">The second wave feminists who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to контрацептивам, now are beginning to understand what that means.</seg>
<seg id="31">The famous white феминистического movement activist Gloria Стайнем through two weeks after the killing of Michael Brown took Фейсбуком and published a sharp колумнистки Rebecca Carroll, Guardian article which claimed that white Americans took more participation in the protests on issues of racism.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope that women who have a different, but a similar reason to understand the danger, in your body," and the point of view of the racial problems that are substantially different in public polls, will be at the head of the change, "wrote Стайнем.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Стайнем is responsible for the more пересекающийся feminism, which includes and problems of race and gender, her comments about race in America is still startling to some.</seg>
<seg id="34">Researcher Christina Соммерс American entrepreneurial Institute, is the author of "Who stole feminism?" She said to The People that young men in the United States, especially young people of color, "are much more vulnerable than their sisters," but Стайнем Фергюсоне contradict the negative criticism, which she previously clear.</seg>
<seg id="35">We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for the boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, when the White House has recently initiated a programme of "Сторож, my brother," to help the vulnerable black and испаноговорящим followed the US changed remarkably for the young men, the reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Стайнем.</seg>
<seg id="37">Police relationship with the black community is not the only problem, продвигающая helm of traditional feminism.</seg>
<seg id="38">After the U.S. Border Guard Service arrested around 63000 unaccompanied minors at the southwestern border of the country this year, immigration reform came to the surface again, this time as a problem with women.</seg>
<seg id="39">Andrea China, co-chairman of singularly ineffective policy, the organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to make this issue as important for women, she had only to share stories of immigrant women.</seg>
<seg id="40">"They speak for themselves," said China.</seg>
<seg id="41">When the vast majority of working visas are issued [иммигрантам-мужчинам], women who come with them, find themselves in positions vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="42">"These stories are the women's organizations," she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the market, 2009-2014</seg>
<seg id="2">This week the Ministry of Economic Development will make the government a comprehensive plan for the development of clean vehicles in Russia, told the deputy director of the department of Oleg Плужников round table that held the newspaper Vedomosti at the Moscow show - 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">The plan drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals is to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is expected that the document will be passed in late September, early October, "says Плужников, proposed measures concern the Army - a plan the development of hybrids and vehicles on the газомоторном fuel in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="5">(A copy of the plan obtained by Vedomosti) is designed for 2014-2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">Will develop criteria for the assessment of electricity and hybrid vehicles and decide how to promote the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">The government report, which will be described in the tax and customs support measures for years, will be prepared by December 2014; a concessional lending and leasing will grace by April 2015, and proposals to reduce the prices of cars, and to encourage the creation of service the infrastructure will be developed by October 2015</seg>
<seg id="8">In the 2014-2015 Budget is expected to amend the regulations to ease conditions for the construction of the infrastructure charge (parking, petrol stations etc.).</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, federal officials plan for 2015 to formulate proposals for regional authorities, as well as to promote the use of clean transport - in the form of providing him with benefits in motion and parking, for example; and at the end of February 2016 and the expansion of government purchases of such transport.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, the Ministry is already in October 2014 will depend on the evaluation of the activities of the regional authorities of criteria that reflect the effectiveness of the support for the production of clean transport, the development of the infrastructure charge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Single market in Russia, while only formed in 2013 across the country sold about 100.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the beginning of the 2014 обнулена an import duty on electric cars, so sales will be approximately 500 pieces, predicts CEO of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey wife.</seg>
<seg id="13">But Baltsi growth does not make any noticeable: Electric cars in Russia in 2013, according to the Association of European Businesses, sold 2,78 million cars and light commercial vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="14">While electric cars in Russia imports only Mitsubishi Motors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Start import preparing Renault - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says director of strategic planning and partnerships in Russia Renault Nicolas Ремиз.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most of the other manufacturers of electric vehicles took in relation to Russia is taking a wait-and-see approach.</seg>
<seg id="17">Between the development and the Russian manufacturers GAZ directors "," ",", "but the trivial.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in January - July 2014, according to the "АСМ-холдинга," Avtovaz has issued 30 2009-2014.</seg>
<seg id="19">Modest because of soaring prices for 2009-2014, admits director of AvtoVAZ by Sergei Аманов, without the support of Parliament in this segment will not.</seg>
<seg id="20">Development of the Russian Army, in addition to the cost of cars (those electric cars that are sold in Russia, on average, twice as much as analogues with internal combustion engines) is an underdeveloped infrastructure charge (retails sites - units), "sighs the Автостата" Sergei Целиков.</seg>
<seg id="21">Because of the soaring prices and low rates of decline in the cost of electric cars in the next 3-4 years remain нишевым segment of the Russian market, forecasts editor Mikhail Авторевю Подорожанский Целиков, agrees with him.</seg>
<seg id="22">Car manufacturers, on the other hand, say that some models are already close to the value of the regular Army.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Russian market, 2009-2014 good prospects, the important thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "real" электромобильность; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of new charging stations, the group's president, Wolfgang Шлимме BMW in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="24">Such implementing infrastructure projects, for example, the state-owned company "Россети": In Moscow built several stations soon will have another 80.</seg>
<seg id="25">Talks about building a network of retails sites are being carried out with other regions.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to the director of the department "Россетей Vladimir Софьина, the company believes in the single market and is ready to build gas stations across the country, but there is a problem: A limited number of single in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging different brands.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, "Россети" as network the company does not have the right to engage in the sale of electricity, the possibility to do this in relation to charging.</seg>
<seg id="28">His wife believes the most effective measure in support of Russia's single market progeSOFT customs duties.</seg>
<seg id="29">Zero rate will act before the end of 2014, the possibility of its renewal, expansion of the preferential list.</seg>
<seg id="30">The transportation tax to environmental (the idea is being discussed and concerns all machines), too, will support the market, but not as noticeably as customs preferences, his wife said.</seg>
<seg id="31">Tax in Russia is relatively small, "says Pankov, unlike, for example, from Norway, where the reduced tax rate led to a sharp increase in sales of 2009-2014 - now they account for 12% of the market.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, and the need for stimulus measures, such as free parking in the centre of town (as it has done in Moscow), I am sure Pankov, or able to move substantially in dedicated lanes, which in Russia does not.</seg>

<seg id="6">On the night of August 29, the White House said that President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss the imposition of additional sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The weakening of the ruble is long-term in nature and, in tandem with the euro, and in tandem with the U.S. dollar.</seg>
<seg id="8">The long-term forecast assumed that mark, "says senior analyst at Alpari Bodrov's" Anna. "</seg>
<seg id="9">All of that has to do with Ukraine, one way or another will be reflected on the courses.</seg>
<seg id="10">As long as this continues, investors will react.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, rumors about invading troops are not confirmed nor on the one hand, but the market was very emotional.</seg>
<seg id="12">All the talk about the fact that he was resistant to such news, yesterday were перечеркнуты.</seg>
<seg id="13">This week, according to forecasts, will be closed around these levels, and the ruble 36,90 37,05 to the dollar.</seg>

<seg id="18">Still, will look at whether to impose the penalties, as promised, will meet NATO.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to him, the ruble weakened sharply after the tax season, then went to the news on Ukraine, the Central Bank said last week that by the end of the year to a fully floating exchange rate and waives any currency interventions.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you look at the daytime wobble, it is no different from the previous ones during this month, all have spooked the mark in 37 rubles, "continued the analyst.</seg>
<seg id="21">And so, in terms of turnover - nothing has happened.</seg>
<seg id="22">Worrying times for the foreign exchange market, let me remind you, when at the end of January, was the strong demand for the currency, as well as a third of March, when the Central Bank отгрузил a record number of currency.</seg>
<seg id="23">In UFS IC and see the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="24">First of all, the growth of revenue from the export operations, as well as to increase the competitiveness of domestic manufacturers at the expense of more expensive imports, "says chief analyst UFS IC Alexei Kozlov.</seg>
<seg id="25">Negative moments can be attributed to the rise in prices of imported goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of the investment in the Russian economy, rising inflation pressures and, as a result, become more expensive for borrowing funds which, in turn, hampers the development of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="27">If we talk about the stock market, the rouble devaluation smoothes over a fall in share prices, expressed in roubles.</seg>
<seg id="28">For example, the MICEX index during trading Thursday fell 1.67 percent and the RTS had lost 3.27 percent.</seg>
<seg id="29">Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of reduction of indices due to the weakening of the ruble during the day more than 1.5%.</seg>
<seg id="30">The weakening of the ruble is an emotional character and can be explained by a massive desire to buy the currency.</seg>
<seg id="31">In practice, gradually emotions go to, and quotes the ruble partially or fully restore lost ground.</seg>
<seg id="32">"We believe, soon we will be able to see the value of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles to the dollar," said Alexei Kozlov.</seg>

<seg id="2">Восстанавливающаяся economy means more customers, the more sales and jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Account for taxes at the state and local level for companies across the country, moderately increased in the past year, when accelerated the recovery, according to a new study, published last week, and the company in the Washington area is no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion in the coffers of the state and local level in fiscal 2013, to 3.8 percent more than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tax burden on business in the state and local level in the past year rose by 4.3 per cent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth going after each other, smaller, bank accounts in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">Taxes, rose 4.3 percent, faster than the local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to the research, which was carried out by the professional services firm, Ernst & Young and the Center on taxation by the state tax policy.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the tax revenue in the county, 56 percent, in taxes on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of tax revenue for Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia, with 28 per cent, the smallest amount of tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="10">To a large extent, is caused by the growth of tax revenues to the same level of the value of real estate companies, the researchers say, that raised property taxes by 3.7 per cent this year, after three years in a row, when growth was less than 1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large proportion of those earnings in larger states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same thing is happening in the Washington area.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion property taxes at the state and local level in the past year, to $9.6 billion more than in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 per cent, compared with the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the return of the value of the property does not have a similar effect on the growth of tax revenue for the state and local level in Maryland, where property taxes are unlikely to exceed one-fifth of companies' tax bills.</seg>
<seg id="14">Virginia and the District of Columbia are paying about half the tax bills at the state and local level, in the form of taxes on real estate.</seg>
<seg id="15">"What is happening in Maryland is that such a large part of their real estate tax base, especially around the District of Columbia belongs to either the government or nonprofit organization that does not pay property taxes," said Douglas Линдхолм, executive director of the Center on taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, Maryland is forced to rely more on, for example, income taxes to pay for those services that exist in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent increase in tax receipts from businesses cannot fully explain the recovery of the real estate market.</seg>
<seg id="18">Income entrepreneurs also, it seems, is on the mend, according to this data.</seg>

<seg id="5">Given the present situation on the market, плачевную music rooted out of the situation, because we are talking not about the new Lana del Ray, or another сладкоголосом representative of a "new R 'n' B ', but the British duo быковатых on playing with the level of volume and intensity, that the last time was in vogue a couple of decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">In general, rates on the first album in connection with all вышеозначенными circumstances were especially high, and is hollow.</seg>

<seg id="3">The news was a surprise, not because no one expected that it would be sold, and because many people expected that YouTube will be a buyer.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago, selling it for a billion Google видеосервису looked completely finished, and this combination was a natural.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was only three years ago as Justin.tv, set a goal to be потоковым service is of a general nature of YouTube in real time.</seg>
<seg id="6">Instead, he quickly became a platform where gamers aired their внутриигровые moments; "YouTube for games in real time," according to Business insider.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is the interface.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Let's play," genre movies, in which всезнайки give (mainly old) games, as in "Таинственном theatre", already popular on YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="9">The fact that YouTube is mentioned often, when we describe it, so the news that YouTube acquires it was without much interest, a classic example of new technology companies, выкупающей potential rival.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube failed, given that, reportedly, he was ready to pay no less than Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">All that we have at the moment is the statement from the executive director of the Emmett antivirus it: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term objectives, and they want to help us get there faster."</seg>

<seg id="19">But know that skeptics like me?</seg>
<seg id="20">It had 55 million unique visitors per month, and it is the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.</seg>
<seg id="21">How Amazon works on this?</seg>
<seg id="22">It is hard to imagine that it свернется in Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube would simply absorb it.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, it is with pleasure that would have received any company: The crowd of young men who dream of advertisers.</seg>

<seg id="4">"My textbook on mathematical analysis, which usually costs $180 for the semester, I got $10 and biscuits" Chick-fil-A "," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying in Ковенант College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The literature on the cost would be $430 last semester, he said.</seg>

<seg id="35">Rent "Mathematical analysis" on the site Chegg.com for six months will cost about $61.</seg>
<seg id="36">Брейси says that students who study literature, can often find the most advantageous prices, as many classic works can now be free, while the literature on natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.</seg>

<seg id="9">Parameters laid out in the draft guidelines, and are designed to eliminate this obstacle in the way of implementing "европротокола" in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to them, the maximum payout for French in connection with the accident, without the police, must not be lower than the limit for "европротоколу."</seg>
<seg id="11">But at the same time, it cannot be above a certain limit, the French insurance contract.</seg>
<seg id="12">The idea, of course, useful and theoretically capable of relieving both Smith and roads.</seg>
<seg id="13">But, most likely, it will not come to the delight of neither motorists nor insurers.</seg>
<seg id="14">The last now talk about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which could lead to the introduction of new rules by the French.</seg>
<seg id="15">As for the drivers, it is hard to imagine what kind of work will have to be done to overcome исконный Russian conservatism.</seg>
<seg id="16">In most cases, the driver would be hours to wait for the inspectors to make small accident, because it ’ s....</seg>
<seg id="17">And we still do not know what will be easier - or to convince drivers to win swindlers in reliability "европротокола."</seg>
<seg id="18">Savings certificate will be registered and irrevocable offer</seg>
<seg id="19">The Finance Ministry wants to block savings certificates on the bearer, but will allow banks to make their analogue безотзывного contribution.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Finance Ministry is preparing a bill that would prohibit savings certificates on the bearer.</seg>
<seg id="21">In recent years, this tool is gaining popularity, as the interest rate is higher than on bank deposits.</seg>
<seg id="22">The fact is that savings certificates on the bearer not the bank deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper because they don't have to make payments to the Fund Deposit Insurance Agency (pointed out).</seg>
<seg id="23">Successfully situation in the fact that this step will be taken because of the small and medium-sized banks, spreading such certificates, and suffer from Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which is estimated to control pointed out, 98% of the level of the market.</seg>
<seg id="24">With the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, is about 3.5%.</seg>
<seg id="25">The problem, explains pointed out, lies in the fact that a small bank customers, who bought such a certificate, in case of withdrawal of the license is trying to get money in pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates on the bearer, may assume that their investment is insured.</seg>
<seg id="27">The absence of reasonable insurance payments on these certificated in case of license revocation by the bank can lead to misunderstandings and social tension.</seg>
<seg id="28">In practice, the agency had tried to seek insurance certificate holders предъявительских redress through the courts, "he said in a pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="29">The problem, of course, made-up.</seg>
<seg id="30">The certificates pay buyers still nobody will, because under the law they have no right to compensation from the State.</seg>
<seg id="31">If the case was that the tool is insured in pointed, together with him and would have banned metal accounts, which means citizens are in grams, one of the four metals: Gold, silver, platinum and palladium.</seg>
<seg id="32">Since these accounts do not fall in deposit insurance, but their existence as long as no one deprives.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is likely that the bearer certificates are a very convenient valuable paper that actually can act in the role of квазиденег.</seg>
<seg id="34">The move does not control: Any customer of the bank can buy a certificate to any citizen, and to putting this certificate can change a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is not by chance that the draft that savings certificate must be issued in paper value, which must be stored in depositories.</seg>
<seg id="36">And to one ’ s banks are allowed to issue such certificates without the right to early repayment.</seg>
<seg id="37">That is a similar безотзывного contribution, which has long been the dream of the bankers.</seg>

<seg id="2">The talks at the highest level in Minsk is not decided, for the sake of whom were called back, but gave rise to a new format: The first face of the European Union met with the chief executives of the Eurasian future</seg>
<seg id="3">And on occasion, the situation around Ukraine (тревожному отлагательств does not tolerate), the leaders of the EU and Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of "hot issues."</seg>
<seg id="4">It is capable of such a structure to work effectively, it is not clear; but it is clear who took the cream from the summit.</seg>
<seg id="5">Questions on this score fell away in the evening on August 26, when the Belarusians, and after them and other евразийцы with Europeans saw the new President Lukashenko.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Belarusian leader revealed отточенной example of talent, it's the behavior of a man who had just caught the jackpot - and is planning a decent old age in high society.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Maidan Lukashenko helped</seg>
<seg id="8">The arrival of the three main European commissioners (of the EU), who met with Mr. Lukashenko and allowed him to perform at the final briefing on their behalf -- not just легитимация president for the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is an application for the recognition or the subject of a full European policy and the main Mareks Segliņš never on the campaign of the Ukrainian crisis.</seg>
<seg id="10">A senior analyst with the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies Denis Мельянцов sure: From now on, Brussels can already speak with Minsk in the same tone as before.</seg>
<seg id="11">"What Catherine Ashton met face to face with Lukashenko, gives reason to believe that the relationship with the EU will be размораживаться and beyond," he said "Огоньку."</seg>
<seg id="12">The tip of the iceberg, there is a hidden part of the preparations for the breakthrough, the Belarusian authorities have begun long before November Maidan in Kiev - summer 2013-го.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The results have been achieved and the EU is the successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues about modernization," lists "Огонька interlocutor," and with the United States held talks on international security.</seg>
<seg id="14">States even took a little bit of sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="15">As regards the Ukrainian events, they and the response to them have only invoked another influx of this process.</seg>
<seg id="16">Minsk, on the one hand, managed to preserve relations with Ukraine are warm enough, not much to lose in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for talks.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other hand, the leader of the Senate, which has not recognized the annexation of Crimea by Russia and urged to punish pro-Russian militia in the Donbas with all severity, and quarreled with Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="18">Minsk has not released any of the Customs Union, nor from the Collective Security Treaty Organization, and placed in a Russian air base.</seg>
<seg id="19">Brussels and Washington have noticed a balanced position on the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated her, believe the experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">How successful is the political movement of Lukashenko, will see how often in the near future to meet in Minsk доведется EU + TC.</seg>
<seg id="21">The press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy Catherine Ashton and diplomacy have failed to answer questions about what Brussels wants from the relationship in a new format.</seg>
<seg id="22">A spokesman for Ashton said only "Maya Косьянчич Огоньку" that decisions on issues of war and peace, this issue is not a priority.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the same time, there were reports that the next meeting on the Ukraine issue, with the participation of the people in the new format may be, and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="24">Drop of tar in Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that about him, it turns out, personally asked the representatives of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, at the final briefing Alexander Lukashenko made it clear: All sides don't mind that Minsk remained central to the meetings as Россия--ОБСЕ--Украина, and at the level of Heads of State and high representatives of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="26">This means that "the last dictator in Europe" quite рукопожатного acquires the status of European leader that helps to solve a global problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">The European farmer's best friend</seg>
<seg id="28">Already the EU delegation included еврокомиссаров on trade and energy, pushed to the conclusion: The main underlying reason for the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbas, and economy.</seg>
<seg id="29">In fact, сверстанное meeting schedule future talks on the supply of gas and to overcome fear of CU on the agreement about an association between Ukraine and the EU looks like achievement more extensive than peace declaration without specific dates and numbers.</seg>
<seg id="30">Trade Commissioner Karl De Гюхт, nevertheless, pointed out: "The EU representatives in Minsk to find solution to the political crisis which has economic consequences, and not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="31">It seems, however, that the economy and the crisis in Ukraine "works" in Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its consequences - and primarily reciprocal sanctions from the West and Russia - Minsk, who until he feels санкционное pressure, with room for maneuver.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to the leader of the Mises Research Centre, the Belarus Романчука, European investors are actively interested in opportunities to Belarus for the supply of agricultural products to the Russian Federation in bypassing sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="34">With the changes, for which President Vladimir Putin at the summit пожурил Minsk.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Of course, these schemes," said Romanchuk Огоньку "," are not the Belarusian businessmen and Russian companies.</seg>
<seg id="36">They worked for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Russian business urgently needs to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of the Belarusian authorities.</seg>
<seg id="38">The second story, "the expert continues," is linked to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not away to the production of raw materials as well as focusing on the Russian market.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Ukrainian producers about 4 billion of exports to Russia, and the Belarusian производственно-торговые scheme now could be very popular. "</seg>
<seg id="40">According to Романчука, the role of the host site for the negotiations, the EU and the vehicle is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of the development of economic ties with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="41">He recalls that the loss of the agricultural sector of the EU sanctions against Moscow are estimated at 10 billion euros, and the Commission is currently proposed 5.45 only 125 million compensation.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Belarusian president may offer to Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for еврофермеров.</seg>
<seg id="43">This can raise the authority of the President of the EU, on the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hospitality without initiatives</seg>
<seg id="45">Catherine Ashton thanked the authorities for the initiative at the summit.</seg>
<seg id="46">But the paradox is that the Minsk from his active role in the birth of a CU + EU открещивается, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with Ukrainian counterpart emphasized that the new format and it was.</seg>
<seg id="47">"It was your suggestion to come, without any навала discuss, not with бухты-барахты decide, after signing the Association Agreement with the EU, to sort out the situation, which at the time was in the Ukraine," he said in front of the cameras to Peter Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, observers interpreted it as an attempt to soothe Moscow, she reportedly was originally against the intermediation of Minsk, which greatly increases his political weight.</seg>
<seg id="49">In the Belarusian diplomatic establishment carefully emphasize that cooperation between the EU and Belarus with the organization on its soil does not pursue a lucrative goals, and the ultimate goal of this format in the future - the creation of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.</seg>
<seg id="50">"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts which, in other areas, in particular in the field of security, proposes and promotes the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation," the Foreign Ministry said "Огоньку Belarus, establishment, where they carefully in recent times.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin demands from Kiev to begin negotiations on the "statehood" of eastern Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="2">According to Russian news reports about his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government has stopped fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately started negotiations on the "statehood" отделившегося region.</seg>
<seg id="3">His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later discloses that Putin had in mind the hint that восточноукраинская territory controlled by separatists will become part of Russia, but that we need to reconsider its status within Ukraine, to give русскоговорящему region the opportunity to defend their rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, Mr Putin's call for the government to start talks with the doctrine of government-controlled insurgents as equal to the apparent strategy, which he should, from the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: To help the separatists to take territory and force the Ukrainian government to give новопровозглашенной Новороссии of de facto independence, to closer ties with Russia rather than with the West.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with state television channel activity, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return retained in the eastern separatists of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions, both of which were seized in March and April, after Moscow аннексировала Ukrainian peninsula Crimea on March 18.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists recently named captured territory Новороссией, or New Russia, the name, which refers to the дореволюционным days of glory of the Russian Empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin has said that anyone who believes that peace talks will occur in the near future, when the Ukrainian politicians to campaign for parliamentary elections on October 26, and while government troops attack peaceful settlements of the separatist held regions - "пленник illusions," ITAR-TASS reported.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We must immediately begin substantive talks and not only technical issues but also on the political organization of society and the public status of Southeast Ukraine, in order to serve the interests of the people living there," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskov said that Putin's words about the state had in mind in the context of a broader autonomy that was discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to calm fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and language rights at risk.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian government may give eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is not a matter for discussion between Russia and Ukraine, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and an internal Ukrainian conflict."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Kremlin's press secretary, to rectify an "incorrect interpretation of the words" Putin stressed the decision of the Russian leadership to behave in relation to the breakaway rebellion in the east in any other way than to open the seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the population is ethnic Russians 2-миллионного.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow had to withstand much more heavy battle to attach even Луганскую region of eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and, as the majority of the 6.5 million residents are Russians, and surveys prior to the start of the conflict, showed broad support for the desire to stay within Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">Autonomy, which Russian diplomats discussed at international forums gave regional governments in the Ukraine power to trade agreements and foreign policy, essentially giving the Kremlin the actual control over the territory, which would be combined with the situation in the territory of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the Black Sea peninsula, присоединенном five months ago, is the Russian military fleet, as well as commercial marine institutions and historical sea resorts.</seg>
<seg id="16">In regions between Russia's Rostov region and situation are also mines, factories and melting plants that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his inaugural address June 7, to Ukrainian lawmakers after new elections weighed amendments to the constitution to give отделившимся regions greater control of their finances and the status of the languages.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, his view of the autonomy, it seems, is very different from the view of the Kremlin and повстанцев-сепаратистов, ITAR-Tass and which accuse Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="19">Last call for Putin to Kiev to negotiate with the leaders of the separatists, as with equal, followed new наступлениями rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks rolled into previously peaceful areas of the eastern Ukraine along the Sea of Azov.</seg>
<seg id="20">Separatists supported by Russia took control of the city in the offensive, which Новоазовск officers of the Ukrainian security services say they are afraid that it is the beginning of the campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory to the Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="21">It led to a massive civil and military efforts to strengthen steel port of Mariupol, with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Новоазовском and narrow on the Crimean peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko on Saturday addressed the meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, which has been independent for 23 years.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We are approaching a point of no return came," Poroshenko warned.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukrainian territory.</seg>
<seg id="25">EU summit had not taken certain measures; called for leaders to project a more severe sanctions against Russia, which will be taken in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.</seg>

<seg id="1">Anger has turned out to be the most versatile and functional human emotion</seg>
<seg id="2">Сердитое expression is biologically universal for all mankind, and everyone involved in its creation of a body and the muscle is significant, and is an additional means of expressing power and threat, researchers have found in Australia and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">About their discovery, they reported in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly about them can be found in a press release at the University of California in Santa Barbara.</seg>
<seg id="4">The brain is joined by climbing down and eyebrows, lips, the thin line by nostrils - equally in all cultures, and make it even blind from birth children, who had seen it, said study lead author Aaron Селл.</seg>

<seg id="6">The more physical damage one man can do to another, the greater the opportunity to dictate, but it is up to the person he pleads with anger.</seg>

<seg id="9">To test this hypothesis, the researchers modelled on a computer, where they had or absent each of seven elements гневного face, and showed their students.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although resting eyebrows or by forward chin individually do face evil, then изображенного with such traits of man stronger physically, the study participants acknowledged unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="11">The anger of a man, as well as in animals, a threat: An exaggerated manifestation of its own forces and to agree to that force.</seg>
<seg id="12">Man поджимает inflated nostrils and lips with the same goal, and that frog, which надувается or бабуин, which demonstrates their fangs.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Anger" runs "refusal to accept the situation, a friend and immediately takes the form of effectively has demonstrated the opposite side of the consequences of refusal.</seg>
<seg id="14">But most striking is that none of the components гневного faces is not arbitrary, they are one and the same, "said anthropologist John Туби.</seg>
