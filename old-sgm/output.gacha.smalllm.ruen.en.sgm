<seg id="1">Remembering very American ideal that labor rights is a human rights</seg>
<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis introduced a bill, according to which the organization of trade unions is as civil law.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Where unions, there and jobs middle class," says Allison, a Democrat from Minnesota, which is the co-chairman of the Congress of Progressive Faction.</seg>
<seg id="4">That's why I proudly present Act of expanding the rights of workers with a symbol of the civil rights movement John Lewis.</seg>
<seg id="5">This innovative bill would give workers the same legal opportunities when discrimination organization of trade unions, and other forms of discrimination, stopping power opponents of trade unions</seg>
<seg id="6">Change of the Law on regulation of labour relations so as to allow employees experiencing discrimination for participation in the organization of trade unions, seek justice in civil courts - and receive compensation of damage and punitive payments - a reasonable and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, this is certainly not radical initiative - at least in American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the best way to understand that offer Ellison, Lewis and co-authors of the bill, - remember very American thought.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the attacks, which trade unions were in recent years, - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states throughout the country - Americans once supported countries all over the world to take, expand and to respect labour rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time, which still remember millions of Americans, when this country simultaneously defend democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States invaded Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his assistants helped the country to adopt a constitution, to ensure that the militarized autocracy Хидеки той was replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they have included the text that directly admitted that "the right of workers to organize, and on negotiations, and collective action is guaranteed."</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Эйзенхауер and his assistants helped the Germans to write a constitution, which guaranteed that fascism Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recognizing that workers will need to be organized and be heard in the new state, the Germans have included an article that openly stated: "The right to form associations in order to protect and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed each man and each profession or activity.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreement that restrict or seek to hamper this right, will have no legal force; measures aimed at these goals will be recognised as illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">When former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which was the World Declaration on Human Rights, which in 1948 will be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the included guarantee that "everyone has the right to organize and join trade unions for the protection of his interests."</seg>
<seg id="17">Generations of Americans took for granted basic position that labor rights is a human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country advised by other countries on how to create a civil and democratic societies, Americans have explained that the right to organization of trade unions - and to this union was involved as equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and governmental institutions - must be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now, when these rights are attacked in America, wisely, indeed, to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to their voices were heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the Monk Martin Luther King, Jr. said fifty years ago:</seg>
<seg id="21">History is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now everyone knows that trade union movement not undermined the forces of the nation, but increased them.</seg>
<seg id="23">Raising living standards million, trade unions miraculously have created a market for industry and raised a whole nation to do the level of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attacks on trade unions, forget these simple truth, but history remembers them.</seg>
<seg id="25">History remembers how should and to us.</seg>
<seg id="26">The official recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the protection of civil rights, to prevent discrimination against the organization of trade unions is long overdue.</seg>

<seg id="6">The hearing will be assigned within a month, on which the district court judge will pronounce a more permanent solution to this law.</seg>
<seg id="7">Advocates of abortion rights with joy met this decision, the latest in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying that it will give doctors more time to receive hospital powers.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today's solution guarantees that women Louisiana will be protected from an artful law, which seeks to, to deprive their health and rights," said Nancy Нортап, president and head of the Center for reproductive rights, which filed a lawsuit about the actions of the law on behalf of three out of five clinics state.</seg>
<seg id="9">Was not immediately obvious whether the decision to doctors of the two clinics, which do not have the plaintiffs on the case, and also filed an application for the powers of the reception.</seg>

<seg id="2">Not less than half of products for each of the goods in the chains` sales mix should be produced in Russia, said the deputy of the Duma from "Just Russia" Oleg Nilov has informed.</seg>
<seg id="3">MP has prepared a bill aimed at the introduction of protective measures against domestic producers, writes the newspaper "Izvestia".</seg>
<seg id="4">The document would still be some points will be amended or specified, to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.</seg>
<seg id="5">This applies to goods, which are not produced in Russia. <... > On the rest of the groups of products, which are produced in Russia, retailer will have to provide at least half of their shelves domestic manufacturers, "said Nilov publication.</seg>
<seg id="6">Together with the amendments to article about State regulations of trade in Russia "the draft law provides for making changes to the Tax Code, establishing slower rate VAT 10% during the realization of products produced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea to enter 50% -процентную quota in trade networks is included in its stimulus package for Russian manufacturers.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the shelves will appear in several times more domestic goods.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the initiative can have both positive and negative effect, say the experts.</seg>
<seg id="10">Attorney Налоговик ", a member of the independent expert center" Public Duma "Sergey Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, and also for the Russian agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive, character and will lead to growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">The will be сельхозпроизводители, farmers, small shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">They can sell more, and this means that profit will increase.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, they will have the right to dictate retailers their conditions and prices, because they will be forced to buy their products.</seg>
<seg id="14">Russian manufacturers will be able to increase its activities and sales, which will lead to pay higher taxes than before.</seg>
<seg id="15">It will increase budget revenues, will create new jobs, any industry will expand, any becoming accustomed faster, will be included contribution to GDP growth.</seg>
<seg id="16">Russia's dependence on foreign food will decrease in several times, however, not at once, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="17">Previously, Russian enterprises often could not break on the counters local shops due to high competition from foreign analogues.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche freed itself momentarily and you can breathe a sigh of relief.</seg>
<seg id="19">But do not forget that after all necessary approvals and sanitary inspections to the Russian market will be food products from Latin American countries, Turkey, and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="20">In other words, it is now "moment calm", when the former players have already left, and new have not yet come.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nearly a month you can talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the growth of prices for finished products, "said АиФ.ru first Vice President All-Russian public organization" Russian club financial directors, Tamara Kasyanov.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clearly, the idea to sell in each category at least 50% of Russian food products will allow to consolidate sector for local producers.</seg>
<seg id="23">In this case they will compete with each other, not with goods, which at the expense of subsidies of another state, are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="24">In other words, the struggle for the buyer will between companies, working on a single laws industry.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, says Kasyanov, Russian producers are able to satisfy the 50% domestic needs compatriots not on all the aspects.</seg>
<seg id="26">And in this situation a trading networks will have to "дотягивать" share of Russian goods to half of the product range.</seg>
<seg id="27">In connection with this fears are mounting that on the counters will be substandard goods.</seg>
<seg id="28">Perhaps, under the guise of produced in Russia will be delivered foreign products with if the labels "," adds the expert.</seg>
<seg id="29">A negative effect from introducing quotas will feel large trading networks, especially those who) to cooperate with importers.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is logical that in this scenario will suffer and foreign suppliers, as demand for their products will decline.</seg>
<seg id="31">Litvinenko does not exclude that the law about quotas for domestic goods can respond and the consumers.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fact is that some products of Russian production can be in quality imported ones, while shops will be able to force prices on the second, as a scarce commodity.</seg>
<seg id="33">About a in the early 2000s, the idea of import substitution economists again started talking in February this year due to ongoing devaluation of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="34">Now on the background of the difficult relations with the West question of refusal from imported products becomes even more important.</seg>
<seg id="35">The law aimed to impose retailers on orders suppliers to reckon with domestic producers.</seg>
<seg id="36">Then we much faster and more confident go the way of import substitution and the system of production planning on necessary types of products will be created in a shorter period, "says the deputy Oleg Nilov has informed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Especially effective mechanism of quotation will be for those agricultural sectors, where the potential is especially high, for example, in dairy industry, where the share of imports amounted to 25%.</seg>
<seg id="38">Our farmers really able to fully cover counters Russian stores.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition, a powerful impulse can get and cold production.</seg>

<seg id="1">Inflation out of your holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2">Whether Russians feel sharp rise in prices</seg>
<seg id="3">As a result of the crosstab sanctions of the Russian Federation and the West inflation in Russia will accelerate and could not meet in forecasts authorities, are convinced analysts "VTB Capital".</seg>
<seg id="4">According to experts, deferred consequences антисанкций will lead to inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, in 2014 inflation will be 6,5-7,5%, in the next year and the less - 6.5%.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to the newspaper "Kommersant", this week ministry should make "small, but the principal" changes in the macroeconomic forecast till 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the information of the edition, agency can lower assessment of inflation for 2015 that would eliminate the expected intended income growth of the population.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the forecast it was assumed that food sanctions of the Russian Federation are year - up to August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">In such a situation could be to assume such high inflation?</seg>
<seg id="10">The current situation suggests single shock, but понижательный trend of inflation will not change, "said the source of newspapers in such.</seg>
<seg id="11">Economists from "VTB Capital" do not share the expectations of financial and economic block government about inflation and predict price growth in 2014 at the level of 8%.</seg>
<seg id="12">The main effect of product prohibitions will come together with the possible introduction in the regions of the Russian Federation tax from sales (GAP) in 2015, convinced the experts.</seg>
<seg id="13">Inflationary peak in 9% on February, after which the annual rates of growth of prices will go on recession, some experts believe.</seg>
<seg id="14">By the way, last week, Russian Statistics Service brought the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation introduced "neat sanctions".</seg>
<seg id="15">АиФ.ru interviewed experts and found them inflationary expectations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Artem Деев, head of research at FC AForex:</seg>
<seg id="17">Price growth is observed on the major segments of goods.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moreover, when have become more expensive socially significant products, the government has been forced to run measures system monitoring price stability, in order to prevent risks unjustified price increase in the short term.</seg>
<seg id="19">Suppliers and retailers are already report on a daily basis before regulatory authorities that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason initiates higher prices.</seg>
<seg id="20">Key factors growth of the consumer price index continue to remain a whopping rate of capital flight, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by Russian supervisor, internal conversion due to the flight of the population in foreign currency, as well as the embargo on imported food products from countries that joined sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="21">If inflationary pressures remained under control, the cost of a basket of the minimum set of products not jumped on 12% in one only quarter.</seg>
<seg id="22">The ban on the import of food products provoked shock proposals on the domestic market and led to completely логичному increase the ultimate value.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because at the current stage to us cannot fully run mechanism of the import substitution program, as well as to increase self-sufficiency of the Russian market by domestic production, retaliatory sanctions will continue to bear the risks of growth inationary component.</seg>
<seg id="24">If you add and fiscal reasons associated with the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as ухудшенными prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year, inflation could exceed 8%.</seg>
<seg id="25">Alexander Юрий Director of Research "Alpari"</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, zero it also was above the current level, however, then it is offset by rapid economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="27">I think, at the end of the year inflation will reach 8-8.5%.</seg>
<seg id="28">Plato Магута, managing assets of the Criminal Code of the "Fund Магута"</seg>
<seg id="29">External factor associated with sanctions against Russia, while successfully is constrained by, but if there will be further strengthening pressure, first of all, on the financial sector - this can lead to certain difficulties and increase inflation expectations of the population, which usually traditionally are manifest in purchases cash currency in order to secure their savings.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is possible to assume, that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to smooth the weakening of the ruble, as market methods and government.</seg>
<seg id="31">But price growth begins traditionally after summer lull, and perhaps this autumn will become more tangible.</seg>
<seg id="32">The target level of consumer inflation in Russia in 7.5%, most likely, will weather, as Russia has even financial savings.</seg>

<seg id="15">"As for the proposed calculations for the elements, that in practice it is hard work, as when constructing buildings often used completely different technologies," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is no secret that стройрынок develops thanks largely to госзаказу.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the chairman of the board of the NP "Экспертное community professionals procurement" Catherine Лезиной, today the state is the most effective customer.</seg>
<seg id="18">The ministry engineering industry the capital construction Rosatom Vladimir Malakhov drew attention to the fact that today the market conditionally divided into companies, who have access to the portfolio contracts, and the companies that own monopolies competence and be on this field competitors.</seg>
<seg id="19">He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only when access to contracts will be maximally is defended from someone's control influence.</seg>
<seg id="20">The expert council were invited to form a procurement system in such a way that one and the same performer shall not be entitled to receive more than one contract for the sum of more than 1 billion rubles or several contracts for the sum of more than 1 billion rubles.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Common believe that this approach must be evaluated from the point of view of influence on business, as well as construction management efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="22">As explained Elena Zhukov, in this case you will need to endow the customer functions of the general contractor that will lead to an increase in the number of customer and budget spending on its content.</seg>
<seg id="23">The specialists of the customer must have knowledge to evaluate the quality of the executed contractors works, as well as their security.</seg>
<seg id="24">Often with this by, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the security of a object in general.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition, this approach may result outflow of highly skilled participants of the government purchases in connection with the first in obtaining the state order for a volume of works and a small amount of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="26">The deputy экспертно-консультационного Institute of procurement Alexander Евсташенков believes that now procedure procurement has become a business game on attentiveness contractor.</seg>
<seg id="27">And such an example: "Participant when filling in the application must specify" specific indicators "without words:" Or the equivalent of "," should be "," from "," more "," less "," similar "," or "," type "," a similar type "," not less than "," below "," above "," could, "" may "," can be "," before "," not earlier "," not above "," is not allowed "and etc.</seg>
<seg id="28">Thus, customers often abused their right to establish requirements for the content of the application of contractors.</seg>
<seg id="29">Another problem 44-ФЗ, according to Евсташенкова, became the need to assess still at the stage of filing the application quality through the "paper" proposal.</seg>
<seg id="30">Considering the application participant, really can be assessed only qualified contractor, but not the quality of works for realization of which still do not even started.</seg>
<seg id="31">The quality of the works can be estimated only when their acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="32">The expert council was also asked to transfer the marginal income from the top in the lower tier to disappeared intermediate contractors.</seg>
<seg id="33">The chairman of the expert council, State Secretary, espionage FAS Andrey Цариковский believes that this should not be done, as responsible for the order.</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise, as in the famous репризе Arkady Raikin "status": "To пуговицам claims have?".</seg>

<seg id="45">Say, solution was involved in eggs, however so long is held.</seg>
<seg id="46">House built thoroughly, thank you Демидовым!</seg>
<seg id="47">Perhaps only so as long as no one killed a crumbling ceiling or сваей.</seg>
<seg id="48">Only building still is dying slowly on our eyes: The board and a log house decay, floors repeatedly failed, we pouring cement, but all useless - solution goes into the ground, as well.</seg>
<seg id="49">Say, and have - under our room was лаз and move to the river White, who specially made once lived here old believers to take shelter from danger, in which case.</seg>

<seg id="87">Officials occupier.</seg>
<seg id="88">Sent from one table to another, and then, as in mockery, were given piece of paper without signature and printing: "The Ministry of Culture did not object to the resettlement of residents."</seg>
<seg id="89">I have even a feeling, our house has long is not present in the terms of the city, because at first it was under the number 57, then became 57 A, and now 57 / 1.</seg>
<seg id="90">As if it is already demolished in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="91">"Russian planet" turned to head of the sector ’ s work on Land Resources of Ufa Vladimir Барабашу.</seg>

<seg id="4">And then she armoury his hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">He saw the irritability.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was a very scratchy, as hair, red yes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The last victim of this колючести was a novel, from which he waited more than usual, getting rid of lonely and boring life, and perhaps even some satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Эйлинн Соломонз was much fragile beautiful with взлохмаченными hair and трепещущим heart from the northern island village, even more remote and harsh than Port Ройбен.</seg>
<seg id="9">She came to the south with master over themselves, which Кеверн believed her aunt, with the latter has received in the inheritance house in crude, but like paradise valley under the joyful called "Райская Valley".</seg>
<seg id="10">No one lived in the house a few years.</seg>
<seg id="11">Pipes flowed, in the baths were sitting motionless spiders, слизни left their traces on all windows, confident in the house belongs to them; garden зарос weeds similar to giant кочаны cabbage.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was like cottage from children's books, simultaneously frightening and charming, with full secrets garden.</seg>
<seg id="13">The author: Howard против, whose novel "J" is included in this Букеровской Prize in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="96">First would've kissed - a kiss now became the regular expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; an antidote from fresh ballads, which yielded the console, first kiss her, and then to strike.</seg>
<seg id="97">Excessive clarification, according to Кеверна, because a kiss itself was already hooliganism.</seg>
<seg id="98">Эйлинн Соломонз corps has shown that he must go.</seg>
<seg id="99">He rose from sun loungers, as the old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She felt the weight of lead, but the weight of his grief surprised it.</seg>
<seg id="101">It was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They hardly knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">She watched as he goes, and from the top of the window watched as he goes, its companion - a man, the взваливший on the.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam, the garden, thought it.</seg>
<seg id="105">It was an compassion to him and men in general, although some of them and raised her hand.</seg>
<seg id="106">A man, отвернувшийся from it, he went back, пристыженный, slain, all the ability to fight left his - why she felt that she knew so well, if she could not recall a single case, up to now, when she saw would such?</seg>
<seg id="107">Again one Эйлинн Соломонз looked at your feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">For twenty years before described above events or so Дентерс марта smart and energetic 32-летняя researcher, which worked in "Офнау", informal service control of the Community mood, has prepared a report on maintaining the low and medium level of violence in those parts of the country, where it was expected that it will be reduced, if not will stop at all, given the money and forces that stood out against it.</seg>
<seg id="109">"A lot has been done, and much is done," she wrote, "to mitigate innate aggressiveness people who fought in a thousand wars and won the majority of them, especially among these спутанных branches and narrow расселин area, where, despite hovering over изгородями spires churches, gentle breath of human kindness rarely was felt in history.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, some quality, it turns out that неискоренимы.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher the spire of, it would seem, the низменнее those passion, which he opens.</seg>
<seg id="112">The population shed tears over sentimental ballads, are presented for the stories about преодоленных obstacles and announces about its overheated belief in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness retains its strong grip as in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there are data about what is new and an angry задиристость in homes, the workplace, on the roads, and even in playgrounds.</seg>
<seg id="113">"You have a habit to write too much," said her supervisor, after reading the report.</seg>
<seg id="114">It seems to me, you should read less novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">Бьянко | | | lowered her head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I also must ask you: You атеистка?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I believe that is not obliged to meet," answered Дентерс | | |.</seg>
<seg id="118">You lesbian?</seg>
<seg id="119">Бьянко again insisted on your right to privacy and silence.</seg>
<seg id="120">Feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Again silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I ask", finally said Luther Дэвид "not because I against secularism, лесбийства or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">Here we have no prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="124">We are servants of the society without prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="125">But some forms of hypersensitivity, absolutely reasonable and laudable by themselves, can sometimes distort results, as, for example, those that you was shown to me.</seg>
<seg id="126">It is obvious, that you предубеждены against the church, and what you call "vicious" and "gross", the other would be interpreted as an expression of natural healthy and intensity.</seg>
<seg id="127">Continue to нудеть about THAT IS, IF an IS, as if it happened, if happened yesterday, means deprive the country needed her life force.</seg>
<seg id="128">Бьянко | | | glanced around until Рабиновиц said.</seg>
<seg id="129">For his head pink as flamingos, LED letters repeated tips that "Офнау" gave the country the last quarter of a century or more.</seg>
<seg id="130">Улыбайся his neighbour, appreciate their spouse, listen ballads, go on musicals, speak on the phone, communicate, possible to explain, listen, соглашайся, извиняйся.</seg>
<seg id="131">Conversation better silence, the word song better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I fully understand that you want to say," quietly answered Дентерс марта when satisfied that her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I don't want to say nothing, except that we do not he so effectively, as we convince ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">I am concerned that if we will not ready, we find that repeat mistakes, which initially led to ТОМУ THAT IS, IF an IS.</seg>
<seg id="134">Only this time we выбросим their anger and mistrust not on others.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Рабиновиц joined finger-tips in watermelons.</seg>
<seg id="136">The gesture was meant to mean an infinite patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"You go too far," he said, "calling" mistakes "actions that have committed or had not committed our grandfathers.</seg>
<seg id="138">You go too far and when speak that they threw their "anger" and "distrust" to "other".</seg>
<seg id="139">On your site people should not need reminding you that, realizing the past, i.e. protecting the present, we do not speak about "us" and "them."</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "us" and there was no "other".</seg>
<seg id="141">It was the time of disorder - that's all that we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"For which, if to be honest with ourselves," dared to insert Дентерс, "no part of society can not well justify itself.</seg>
<seg id="143">I do not accuse.</seg>
<seg id="144">Was it bad or good - what is done is done.</seg>
<seg id="145">Then it was then.</seg>
<seg id="146">Nothing more need not tell - here we agree.</seg>
<seg id="147">And how should not be no one to blame, do not need and excuses, if it was appropriate or if it were something right.</seg>
<seg id="148">But why the past, if not to learn -</seg>
<seg id="149">The past существет to we have forgotten....</seg>
<seg id="150">If I can add to this one word -</seg>
<seg id="151">Pyramid of Luther Рабиновица has collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I will discuss your report," he said, sending it.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, on the way to work, it shot down a biker hits a deaf granny, which left on the pavement, as described passers-by "in vicious rage."</seg>

<seg id="69">I would like to call Sheri and simply the most her say 10 years have passed, but I still remember the meeting with her and her husband in London and how they helped Дамиру and me.</seg>

<seg id="79">And I can't stop to feel it.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it is so sad.</seg>

<seg id="82">He is not looking for revenge, for example, it does not fixated on this past nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not like to remember it, but they are very close with six classmates, and they go to a gym from time to time and burn candles there.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was under, he suffered from this - I remember, as he was lying on the couch, and away from us, clock.</seg>
<seg id="85">Did not sleep, his eyes were opened.</seg>
<seg id="86">I also remember how he threw all its weapons and other military toys. Дамиру now 17, he above me, cute, clever and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">Me with it is hard to believe that a few hours I was so sure that he died and that I would never see more.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I was able to recover from the explosion and on its feet, I glanced, I saw hell around when part of the bodies were everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely sure that it is impossible to my little boy was able to survive in this hell.</seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember that I shouted to him:" Damir, Run, убегай ", but again I was so sure he me not heard.</seg>

<seg id="139">During capture, he was seen in the gym sitting next to a bomb at the feet of террориста-убийцы.</seg>
<seg id="140">Indeed, it is a miracle that he was not killed.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It seems to us that it was yesterday," says George who wanted to learn from intelligence officer in the FSB, but could not because of the damage that was caused by his health during the capture.</seg>
<seg id="142">It is still with me, this is not something that I left behind.</seg>

<seg id="155">I sent their documents, including the medical, and they said that it is impossible.</seg>
<seg id="156">My second passion were animals, so I went in veterinary institute.</seg>
<seg id="157">I had studied there two years.</seg>
<seg id="158">He learns to treat all animals "from the cats to cows".</seg>
<seg id="159">He said: "I know that never tell their children about their experience.</seg>
<seg id="160">This is not what children should know, and, of course, not what they need to survive.</seg>
<seg id="161">His mother Marina, 42 years, said: "This pain never leaves me.</seg>
<seg id="162">It in my soul, worse when anniversary of the approaching.</seg>
<seg id="163">I will go and I will attend the ceremonies, which will be conducted to celebrate it.</seg>

<seg id="166">I was waiting for him at home and could not help.</seg>
<seg id="167">I am thankful to God that he returned to me. Here in Beslan imprint lies on each.</seg>
<seg id="168">He remains with us.</seg>
<seg id="169">Georgy now an adult, but this nightmare still with him.</seg>
<seg id="170">It is difficult to accept, when something so terribly unfair, is with you.</seg>
<seg id="171">He boy, he loves sport, but can not do because of knee.</seg>
<seg id="172">He had several operations, he can walk, but cannot exercise.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say that he 50% overcame this nightmare, but cannot be fully overcome and forget it.</seg>
<seg id="174">This eerie experience will remain with us.</seg>
<seg id="175">Many friends and neighbors were killed during capture, and it only reinforces my pain.</seg>
<seg id="176">I lost a lot of people I know well and which were roads me.</seg>
<seg id="177">My son with me, and this is the best gift God could I do, but my heart aches for those, who was killed.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know families, where were born new children, but I know and widows, who never were married.</seg>
<seg id="179">It is hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.</seg>
<seg id="180">I will never forget how heart выпрыгнуло from my chest at the moment when I saw him in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="181">Now I look at what is happening in the world, "war in different regions.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips, how to achieve the best quality of underwater photos and video</seg>
<seg id="2">If you want to take pictures or shoot video under water, in front of you a number of options equipment.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is waterproof Point and Shoot camera from Sony, for example, Nikon Coolpix AW120, or экшн-камера, for example, 197 Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which are sold for $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I made these images on a family holiday with the help of several cameras, all at a price of about $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">No matter what hardware you use, a few rules need to adhere to in order to achieve the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Перепроверяйте its equipment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you waterproof Camera, make sure that the battery cameras and other branches of the tightly closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, get the camera and set for the type of photos or videos that you will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some photo and video cameras have regimes shooting or object type that optimize exhibition for mid tone underwater conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in the water, at first understand how deeply your equipment can fall.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are only 5 feet, other - 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Have a look at our management of the buyer and ratings of digital cameras for both traditional and watertight models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Remove a few frames, because many of them do not manage.</seg>
<seg id="14">The "auto camera" have LCD that will help you correctly images, while экшн-камер them usually is not present.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have LCD, it will be difficult to see under the water, and the layout of the frame will be random process.</seg>
<seg id="16">However do a few frames.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also, if your camera have serial shot function mode, which removes a few frames with a slightly different exposure settings, take it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">The amount of light significantly decreases, the deeper you нырнете under water.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, stay at the surface when you are shooting at the swimming pool, the river or the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">It also allows you to transfer more color in the photos; the deeper you leave, the less the colors you see.</seg>
<seg id="22">Подплывайте closer to the objects.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is a great advice for shooting on land, but it is even more important than under water due to mid tone light conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">Especially important if you're shooting on экшн-камеру: This equipment often is equipped with fixed, широкоугольной lens, which means that you will have to get closer to objects, if you want to fill the frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was such a man, whose power personality could shake everything around, even in such a gigantic organization, as the National Health Service.</seg>
<seg id="2">Консультирующий anesthesiologist, he devoted his career deliverance patients as from suffering sickness and suffering treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among those who spoke to him, remembers his wife, was officer gence, specially M16, which had to live with devastating consequences of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson understood that as long as the doctor passionate about diagnoses and diseases, those who is primarily concerned about something else entirely - pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">Once in 2007, however, he turned out to be those who began to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I don't felt, as usual," he wrote in May last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was hard to find in ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fighting with symptoms similar to the flu, he found that irritably reproaches his wife, Джулиет.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want to all happened sooner rather than later," said he.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Джулиет left for a week, Lawson discovered that he unusually and it is unclear why upset.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was not so.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked colleague do X-rays chest.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks before he went skiing in the French Alps.</seg>
<seg id="14">The results of the x-ray came.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was mesothelioma, incurable cancer, which affects плевру, or the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="16">For most cancers difficult to find out the exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although some people get sick lung cancer, for example, not all patients lung cancer smoked.</seg>
<seg id="18">But with attributable to mesothelioma differently.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases, the reason - contact with the asbestos, grainy construction material, who once called the "miracle", but which, as now it is known, fatally dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us mesothelioma - disease, which can be ignored.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos, after all, - material from the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in the UK with the 1960 ’ s, when not industrial ban entered into force.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even when he was used, only people from specific industries worked in close contact with him: Трубоизолировщики, builders, carpenters and workers docks, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">Industrial toxin from another era, he hardly is cause for concern today.</seg>
<seg id="25">But this serenity is mistaken.</seg>
<seg id="26">The United Kingdom, it turns out, is now at the peak of the epidemic мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="27">Here from мезотелиомы kills more people than in any other country on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="28">The annual mortality rate approximately in 2500 people, more than twice more people die from the disease than as a result of accidents.</seg>
<seg id="29">The annual number of deaths from мезотелиомы since 1980 and the projected number of deaths in the future in the UK</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason why we feel his deadly consequences now, is that, while the use of asbestos illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were, in the end, is prohibited by law in 1999), on the development of мезотелиомы are usually tens of years.</seg>
<seg id="31">And attack мезотелиомы is not limited to veterans specialties of industrial construction.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was, and in many cases remains, laid in the house where we live, offices, where we work, school, where we learn, and shops, where we go shopping.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result, mesothelioma pays no attention to class, the level of prosperity, profession or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">Typical bastions, from fashionable London department stores to private schools, as it turned out, not salvation.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parliament is riddled with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even hospitals, which are designed to treat us, were reservoirs this fatal a carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was not трубоизолировщиком.</seg>
<seg id="39">In fact, he had to think, where he could enter in contact with the asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he realized.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It seems that could be a lot of asbestos in tunnels in hospital, where I spent six years in training," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">All students, nurses, physicians and грузчики - used these тоннелями.</seg>
<seg id="43">It is interesting, how many of my peers ill the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">It was a question that, unfortunately, he could give a partial response.</seg>
<seg id="45">"From the four doctors who partners in the hospital Guy and subsequently developed mesothelioma over the past five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I alone remain alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us ill this disease?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Лоусону was diagnosed with "mesothelioma", when he was 48 years.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died, 17 February this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">Live that long unusual.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty percent of patients attributable to mesothelioma die through 8 months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">She always lethal.</seg>
<seg id="52">Thus, now we can only repeat the question Lawson: "How many of us ill this same disease?"</seg>
<seg id="53">According to a leading expert on мезотелиоме in the UK, Professor Julian Пито, most likely to assume, that between 1970 and 2050, when asbestos epidemic in the UK should put themselves, will die about 90,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most now are not that will die in this way.</seg>
<seg id="55">Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada Alamy</seg>
<seg id="56">Quick viewing reports from the halls of court, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far spread attack мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="57">In this June, for example, Marks & Spencer recognized that the was Джэнис Ellen contact with the asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked in the nine years from 1978 to 1987, directing the departments of clothing on two objects, one of which was the main shop at Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs. Ellen was only 18 years old when she began to work in M & S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now has two children older than 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Before it happened," she says, "I have never heard about мезотелиоме, I hardly knew about the town of Asbest.</seg>
<seg id="62">I never could have come that me it will affect.</seg>
<seg id="63">Few people really many know about the town of Asbest.</seg>
<seg id="64">Strictly speaking, asbestos is not one substance, and a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">They got its name from the word "асбестиформ", which means fbrous structure, which informs them strength and flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="66">Of these six, three were often used in construction.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotile, widely known as white asbestos, much more often than other meets in buildings today.</seg>
<seg id="68">It has been used in the roof panels, outdoor stove pipes, boilers, thermal insulation, even in brake disk cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is less смертелен than other forms of asbestos, but still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization "serious source of harm", which can lead to death.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, brown asbestos (амозит) and blue asbestos (крокидолит).</seg>
<seg id="71">United Kingdom was once the largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that "there are good, albeit indirect reason to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with attributable to mesothelioma [UK]."</seg>
<seg id="72">Employee Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the main company shop on Oxford Street, London Alamy</seg>
<seg id="73">Джэнис Ellen, perhaps not thought of myself as a typical victim мезотелиомы, but the work of Julian Пито suggests that its history not is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He spent the study patients, which suggests that "a significant percentage of мезотелиом when there is no known impact at work or at home, were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment."</seg>
<seg id="75">Most of such effects, he says, is "the usual the use and impact of weather" on our building.</seg>
<seg id="76">No one, it seems, can not be sure that he in security.</seg>
<seg id="77">The report Goddard Consulting, in which was seen Westminster Palace, demonstrates how people, even in the heart of the government, could be exposed to unconsciously.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines for premises parliamentary committees were infected with the asbestos, deadly fibers which could be set in motion something so harmless, as "strong flow of air."</seg>
<seg id="79">Members of parliament is often blamed that they pursue its own interests, but in this case, it seems that the reverse is true.</seg>
<seg id="80">Although Directorate on the maintenance of parliament insisted that Westminster Palace was "the clean bill", now she acknowledged that it is necessary to work at £1 billion on the reconstruction of the Parliament, усовершенствовав electrician and by removing the asbestos and and that after the general election 2015, members of the Parliament, perhaps, will meet in the conference centre QE2 nearby, and not on the green benches Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="81">The report Goddard noted that "the situation with the asbestos evolving in accordance with different rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">It is impossible to know whether this error management cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All that you can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">One of those who failed to identify your contact with the asbestos is Graham и, general practitioner.</seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson, и, 50 years, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos, when he worked in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I worked at the hospital, which successfully were charged claims related to the asbestos," he says, "but I can't prove that in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">So it is difficult to remember all the places, where he worked, and dates.</seg>
<seg id="88">That he remembers clearly, so this day in the beginning of December 2009, when his wholly overcame something that was like flu.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly I the beginning of the sector.</seg>
<seg id="91">It started very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terrible.</seg>
<seg id="93">I thought that I can't go all the way to home.</seg>
<seg id="94">As a doctor, и knew that the pain comes from pleura, shell around the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="95">But, like Джэнис Ellen, he just did not have reason to suspect мезотелиому.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the end, he could not walk on the work of the month.</seg>
<seg id="97">Baffled doctors did X-rays chest and put плевральные катетеры to pull out liquid of light and send it on analyses.</seg>
<seg id="98">Yet his condition оставлось without the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">Gradually his health has improved and he returned to work.</seg>
<seg id="100">But from time to time the same symptoms returned, often after he was engaged in sports and he breathed heavily.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, one of the patients Abbott came to him in the reception room with similar symptoms, and he was later diagnosed "mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="102">But even then и not linked it with its own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">In the end, the patient was on tens of years older and worked with asbestos directly.</seg>
<seg id="104">Link in this case was obvious.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011 state Abbott deteriorated again, and консультировавший his doctor showed its results CT and X-rays group of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, exactly two years after и began to feel bad, the sensor, equipped with the camera, was introduced in the cavity between shell his chest and shell his light.</seg>
<seg id="107">I'm an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I usually just go further, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="109">I am not too was about it, to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife, has experienced.</seg>
<seg id="111">The result of the biopsy arrived on week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that this mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham и: Diagnose mesothelioma</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly и was in meetings with nurses Macmillan, one of which offered him to contact a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">It was then that he realized the scale of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turns out that asbestos is widely used, especially in large public buildings, where quite often was asbestos thermal on pipes," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, now become sick with the disease.</seg>
<seg id="117">Thus, mesothelioma now afflicts more young people atypical professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous isolated asbestos pipes in hospitals were in basements, however it is unlikely that suffered patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees, which took place on pedestrian tunnels to get from one building (as Andrew Lawson), or ate in the basements of table (as often did Graham и) almost certainly really were exposed to toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">For several decades after the war, it turns out, hospitals were the place where, in theory, life for поциентов, but a place that constituted a threat to life for doctors who them treated.</seg>
<seg id="121">It still continue to delete today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Schoolchildren installed your burner Бунзена on asbestos platforms</seg>
<seg id="123">And this is not only the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos used often in offices, shops, libraries and мэриях due to their amazing insulating and fire-resistant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="125">Schools, too.</seg>
<seg id="126">In fact, many, most likely, for the first time were exposed to asbestos in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="127">Across the country, in countless lessons chemistry, schoolchildren installed your burner Бунзена on asbestos platforms.</seg>
<seg id="128">Appeared websites, catering especially attention to the problem of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things like floor tiles or roof sheds, as a rule, contained asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"This is an industrial poison in a huge number of our buildings," says Andrew Morgan, a lawyer, who was represented by Andrew Lawson in a case against the hospital Gaia.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case, the only contact, which could remember the patient woman, was the demolition of garden shed in the 1970 ’ s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So be careful снося garden sheds.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effect of the diagnosis, when it is known, that the illness is incurable, is huge.</seg>
<seg id="134">"To realize it, is quite a lot of time," says Graham и.</seg>
<seg id="135">I returned to work and tried to continue, but realized that I could not focus on what I do.</seg>
<seg id="136">I stayed in surgery two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I realized that I have to leave and deal with them.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I no longer meeting Christmas</seg>
<seg id="139">One of the most difficult thing was the transition from a doctor in the position of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">As countless patients before him, he remembers how was distracted information, which was necessary to take.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was hard to all recognize," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked my doctor" How many do I have time? "</seg>
<seg id="143">I gave about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember, as I thought, "Well, I no longer meeting Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's all. "</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma especially dangerous, as the mechanics of how we support life, "the very act of breathing - causes cancer, which kills.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases of мезотелиомы caused by contact with the asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos is composed of tiny fibers.</seg>
<seg id="149">When asbestos is being destroyed and fibre carcinogenic, they can get stuck in плевре, the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibers are annoying плевру and can cause mutations cells.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem occurs because of the needle inhalation of asbestos fibers," Professor Tom Treasure, кардиоторакальный surgeon, who came in 2001 in hospital Gaia.</seg>
<seg id="152">The hospital, where, as suspected Andrew Lawson, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, the treatment мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="153">Treasure knew Lawson and treated some other who, probably, was exposed to IALD member firms have access in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">When immaculately asbestos fall into the fabric of the lung, says Treasure, "breathing them pushes on the periphery, where is the shell.</seg>
<seg id="155">This, in its essence, invasive process from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="156">Conventional treatment options other forms of cancer far less effective in мезотелиоме.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, causes hot disputes.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some think that it is worth a try.</seg>
<seg id="159">Treasure do not agree.</seg>
<seg id="160">"It is impossible to cut плевру," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">It is impossible to around it cope with a knife.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, this cancer "is not very well to chemotherapy," which "works", but people.</seg>
<seg id="163">"From time to time there are patients who live long," says Treasure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But in the end, they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">The writer Stephen Jay Gould has died in 20 years after was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years after diagnosis, Graham и continues to fight.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he fell ill attributable to mesothelioma, Abbott introduced with Andrew Лоусоном, who, four years after diagnosis, alone turned into a desk support and consultations for patients.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Yes, cancer Central", cheerfully he said, when they called.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," says и.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was diagnosed 4 years ago, and he still very energetic.</seg>
<seg id="172">First Эбботту offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and extended his life only for a month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was in despair," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, nevertheless, "managed to give the somewhat more positive coloring."</seg>
<seg id="176">Meeting with several specialists, и decided to continue treatment with Professor Лоиком Ланж-Лаздунски, professor of thoracic surgery in the hospital Gaia.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had the advantage is that I need not have direction, I just called them, and they took me", recognized Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">Average patient would get direction and approved for funding.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money plays a crucial role for patients with attributable to mesothelioma to get the best from existing types of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="180">But when this treatment, finally, inevitably are ineffective, many patients face even with one financial reason for concern "about the future of families that they will leave.</seg>
<seg id="181">And then they appeal to the courts for compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It was known, that asbestos is bad for health, with 1898," says Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But what has changed in the 1960 ’ s, is that it became clear that even very small amounts of could expose health risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">It was then started talking about bad faith companies.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and hospital Guy eventually resolve, but this was not "settlement on the full value of the", according to Morgan, as Lawson could not clearly prove that his mesothelioma was the result of exposure to asbestos in the hospital Gaia.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation into his death, the representative of the hospitals Guy still confirmed, however, that "asbestos in its basement, mentioned, was removed in the 1990 ’ s."</seg>
<seg id="188">It was too late for Andrew Lawson.</seg>
<seg id="189">How to remove asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">Strictly speaking, bind lethal contact with the asbestos to one company or place of work - usually through dozens of years after that - turned out to be a big problem for patients with attributable to mesothelioma requiring compensation.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have changed the owner or closed.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance archives could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who is protected from claims, know that on their side of the time, which the plaintiffs, of course, is not present.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, this year took serious new legislative acts, which attributable to mesothelioma patients with the process of exaction of compensation, even if their former employers can not be tracked.</seg>
<seg id="195">In accordance with this law was created £350-миллионный Fund, funded by the insurance industry, for those who was diagnosed with after July 2012 and who can prove contact, but who do not with whom sue.</seg>
<seg id="196">In such cases, patients will get 80 percent of the amount that the court could to award in the compensation - about £120,000.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful claims under this scheme is expected to every year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan, as many who works with patients with attributable to mesothelioma, believes that £350 million are "very good work" for the industry insurance.</seg>
<seg id="199">"This transaction, written by companies for insurers," he says, hinting that the amount is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay, if not intervened the time period and sick with attributable to mesothelioma could track the company and to file a lawsuit in the usual way.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even Mike Пеннинг, Minister of Labour and pensions, admitted that the law "class."</seg>
<seg id="201">However, and Пеннинг, and Morgan recognize that, with seven people die every day, rapid action was needed.</seg>
<seg id="202">"People suffer so much, and they need help today," said Пеннинг during the second reading Bill of мезотелиоме in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">By that time Graham и was in the hands of Professor Лоика Ланж-Лаздунски 19 months.</seg>
<seg id="204">After the primary consultation Ланж-Лаздунски recommended surgical intervention, which, unlike Tom Трежера, he believes to be effective.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was followed by a radiotherapy and chemotherapy - тритерапия, in which Ланж-Лаздунски boasts all 40 percent of the survivors of patients for five years.</seg>
<seg id="206">И felt a surge of strength.</seg>
<seg id="207">"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says и.</seg>
<seg id="208">You see this in patients all the time.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is a power, which supports you.</seg>
<seg id="210">When give up, of very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham и went into operation in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">By the end of August he finished the last of the six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">Subsequent scan showed no trace of disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I made scanning in March [2014].</seg>
<seg id="215">There were several spots [cancer] in my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I just had to be executed 50.</seg>
<seg id="217">It is not a threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="218">It is the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="219">And again и went through six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now there is no trace of tumors.</seg>
<seg id="221">However, this process both physically and emotionally heavy.</seg>
<seg id="222">You can think of practical things - about finance, when I die, for example, or about what we need to show his wife, how does the timer on big prb.</seg>
<seg id="223">When you receive bad news, you become безрадостным.</seg>
<seg id="224">You need to look forwards.</seg>
<seg id="225">As the father Ellie, 16 years, and Тэмзин, 14 years, it is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">"It is hard for parents," he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It is hard to understand what to say and how much to say.</seg>
<seg id="228">When I for the first time was diagnosed with the girls, I said that I had the disease, which means that I shall not live for up to old age.</seg>
<seg id="229">They reacted very differently.</seg>
<seg id="230">Тэмзин very sociable and energetic.</seg>
<seg id="231">She told to all your friends, and to us very quickly called many.</seg>
<seg id="232">Ellie was more low-key.</seg>
<seg id="233">It is not said a lot.</seg>
<seg id="234">Such talk is something with than have to face all patients cancer.</seg>
<seg id="235">But for patients with attributable to mesothelioma such discussions do not possession hope, even glimmer opportunities to survive.</seg>
<seg id="236">This disease is a (even as, ultimately, for Stephen Jay Гулда) grim certainty.</seg>

<seg id="2">China ’ s parliament adopted a decision on Sunday not allow voters Hong Kong nominate candidates for elections 2017, despite the growing requirements of democratic reforms.</seg>
<seg id="3">Such a move is likely to mark the beginning long promised protests in the business quarter of Hong Kong, as activists began planning and mobilization in a few hours after this statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the National People ’ s Congress, in fact, allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who do not loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's not обмануло our expectations, but still infuriating," said the legislator Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is not that Beijing promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">They lied to the people of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is obvious that we are dealing with authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">Protecting China ’ s decision, Lee Fey, Deputy Secretary General Standing Committee of the National People ’ s Congress, said that allow nation-wide nomination to the elections of the head of the Hong Kong would be too "chaotically."</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when the United Kingdom handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing promised allow residents in the region to choose by voting the head of government, starting from 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chinese leaders have adopted in Sunday decision as democratic step forward, as it gives гонконгцам right to direct vote; but the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process in his hands with the commission of primary, strictly controlled from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, according to a new article, only candidates who "like the country and love Hong Kong" will be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision was taken after the summer, when there were some of the most scale and received wide publicity protests in Hong Kong for many years.</seg>
<seg id="14">For the great part of продемократической campaign in Hong Kong is movement occupy Central With Love and Peace, the organizers which threatened to block the financial district of Hong Kong, if Beijing does not guarantee of this universal suffrage.</seg>

<seg id="19">We regret to inform that today all the possibilities of dialogue exhausted and the seizure of the central district undoubtedly will take place.</seg>
<seg id="20">The state authorities in Hong Kong were preparing for the Beijing a few days, and on Sunday at the headquarters of the government were strengthened security measures with the involvement of the police and the barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the basis of unrest is a sense of many in Hong Kong, that they slowly lose control of their own city.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of people from the mainland strengthens competition in the field of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also increases the fear that values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and freedom of speech, begin to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists raise the question of the race and behaviour of the police after Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">Unarmed teenager was killed police officer in Фергюсоне, Missouri, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">Coming raise their hands, chanting: "Hands up, not shoot" until they are waiting in the queue before the funeral.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Фергюсоне, Missouri, connected with the murder of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Зоила Peres noticed shift in интернет-разговоре among white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">On its experience, white feminists, leave comments, put gender above race, when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, as the increased tension in the Midwest and attracted national attention, Peres saw answers white women, who focused on 100 percent on race.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared to the reaction black women soon after the assassination of 9 August, personal essay with such titles as "thoughts about Фергюсоне on behalf of white women" and "feminism is not only about the internal repression of women" appeared relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Peres they have demonstrated a significant shift.</seg>
<seg id="9">"In feminism, I do not think that there are many people who speak of white skin and Privileges on such a high level," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People feel the need to say something about what happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is very symbolic for crisis, with whom we have, and because (the situation in Фергюсоне) so tied to race, they felt that it should specify.</seg>
<seg id="12">For professor of English at the University of Ohio Кориты Mitchell Ferguson has revealed the problems that blacks American women face every day, but which are not perceived as "women's issue" in the cultural sphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can write something funny in Facebook about what is going on with me and my partner, and get 150 Likes from everywhere," said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">When I write something about how color people are attacked in his own country, silence clearly.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Why women safely publicly to speak about relations, but not about security in the public sphere?" She asks.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women like Mitchell, who studied the questions of race, gender and sexuality in US history, there is no dichotomy between issues concerning race and gender.</seg>
<seg id="17">With its point of view, blacks, women are in a position to clearly share these problems; they are faced with complex reality every day.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women now combine questions race and gender in feminist мейнстриме, Физерстоун Хэттери, Professor women's and gender studies at the University of George Mason, says that their predecessor did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 1865 and 1890 years линчевали, at least 10,000 black men, and the reason that almost always served as rape white women", told Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="20">Need a white woman, confirming the story to justify the lynching of.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the point of view of Хэттери, the gap between white and black women occurred when white the suffragists, for example, Susan B. Anthony studied the situation in the late 1800s, and saw that the struggle for suffrage will be effective only for one of the groups: Women or black.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They have decided to put down all eggs in a basket voting rights for women, and the right to vote for the black should appear later", told Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="23">Look back on such things gives us a clear idea of why women of color do not trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We did nothing good.</seg>
<seg id="25">We never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women have the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to mob lynchings white women have come together against the Association of women in the South to prevent mob lynchings.</seg>
<seg id="27">This group has appeared almost in 40 years after the black women first asked to help, said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">From the point of view of Mitchell, the rise of reactions white feminists on problems raised situation in Фергюсоне, "the conduct of the police, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white a feminist had to" catch up "the problems that blacks women live up in several generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"True, it would be great if female who have such [traditional Офензива] ideology, would seriously for the right to educate a child, as they relate to the right to contraception?" Asked Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="30">Feminists second wave, which have made careers in the struggle for reproductive rights and access to контрацептивам, now begin to understand what it means.</seg>
<seg id="31">Known white activist феминистического movement Gloria Стайнем two weeks after Michael Brown took advantage of Фейсбуком and published a harsh article колумнистки Guardian Rebecca Carroll, which demanded that white Americans took more participation in the protests on issues of racism.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope that women who have another, but a similar reason to understand the danger in the body, and points of view on racial problems that are substantially different in the polls public - will be at the head of the change," wrote Стайнем.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Стайнем guarantee for more пересекающийся feminism, which includes and problems of race, and gender, its comments about race in America still surprise some.</seg>
<seg id="34">The researcher American entrepreneurial Institute of Cristina | | |, author of "Who stole feminism?," said She The People that young men in the United States, especially colored young people, "much more vulnerable than their sisters", but keeping Стайнем about Фергюсоне contradict criticism, which she expressed earlier.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate growth of the market of electric vehicles</seg>
<seg id="2">This week the Ministry of Economic Development will make in the government a comprehensive development plan for the ecologically clean transport in Russia, told the deputy director of the department of the Ministry of Oleg Плужников at the round table, who had "Vedomosti" on the Moscow Motor Show - 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">The plan is written on behalf of the government, one of the main goals - reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is expected that the document will be adopted in the end of September - the beginning of October, says Константин proposed measures concern of electric vehicles and hybrids - the development plan of the vehicles on газомоторном fuel in Russia already have.</seg>
<seg id="5">Plan (a copy of Vedomosti) is designed for 2014-2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">To develop criteria for assessment of electric and hybrid transport and decide how to stimulate the use of and produce environmentally friendly vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">A report to the government, in which will be described tax and customs support measures electric transport, will be prepared by December 2014; scheme concessional lending and preferential leasing will appear by April 2015; and proposals to reduce prices machines, stimulate localization and service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014-2015, it is suggested to make changes in regulations to facilitate conditions for construction of charge infrastructure (on car parks, petrol stations, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, the federal officials intend to for 2015 to formulate for regional authorities proposals to those also promote the use of environmentally friendly transport - in the form of him advantages at movement and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and suggestions on the expansion of the government purchases such transport.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, the Ministry of Economic Development has already by October 2014 will make the list of indicators in assessing the activities of the regional authorities criteria, reflecting the effectiveness of support for the production of ecologically pure transport, development of charge infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="11">The market of electric vehicles in Russia only is formed in 2013 throughout the country sold about 100 of electric vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the beginning of 2014 обнулена the import duty on electric cars, however sales will be approximately 500 pieces, predicts Chief Executive Director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia Andrei Pankov.</seg>
<seg id="13">But and life-time carat growth does not electric cars any noticeable: In 2013 in Russia, according to the Association of European Business, sold 2.78 mn passenger and light commercial vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="14">While in Russia electric cars imports only Mitsubishi Motors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Start the import is preparing Renault - the company is focused on corporate clients, says the director on strategic planning and partnerships Renault in Russia Nicolas more shafts.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most other producers of electric transport took toward Russia a wait-and-see approach.</seg>
<seg id="17">Development of electric vehicles have and Russian manufacturers - "," GAZ directors, "", but the release of the Foreign Ministry is small.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in January - July 2014, according to "АСМ-холдинга", "AvtoVaz" released 30 electric vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="19">Demand is due to the expensiveness of electric vehicles, recognizes the Director of AvtoVAZ engineering Sergey Арсланмурат without state support a breakthrough in this segment will not be....</seg>
<seg id="20">The development of the Russian market of electric vehicles in addition to new machines (those electric cars that are sold in Russia, on average twice as expensive analogues with internal-combustion) holds an underdeveloped charge infrastructure (stations - units), sighs, general director of "Автостата" Sergei целиков.</seg>
<seg id="21">Because of the high and low rates of decrease of cost price electric cars in the next 3-4 years will remain нишевым segment of the Russian market, predicts that the chief editor of "Авторевю" Mikhail Подорожанский, целиков agrees with him.</seg>
<seg id="22">Car manufacturers, on the contrary, they say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the cost of the ordinary.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Russian market of electric vehicles good prospects, the main thing - instill confidence that "электромобильность" real; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of all new charging stations, emphasizes the President of BMW in Russia Wolfgang Шлимме.</seg>
<seg id="24">Such infrastructure projects implements, for example, the state-owned company "Россети": In Moscow built several stations, soon there will be about 80.</seg>
<seg id="25">Negotiations on the network are filling stations and with other regions.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to Director of "Россетей" Vladimir Софьина, the company believes in the market of electric vehicles and is ready to build gas stations across the country, but there are problems: A small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging different brands.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, "Россети" as network company do not have the right to be engaged in the sale of electricity, the possibility to do it for charging.</seg>
<seg id="28">Punk believes the most effective measure state support of formation in Russia market of electric vehicles intended to customs duties.</seg>
<seg id="29">Zero rate will act up to the end of 2014, the possibility of its extension, extend preferential list.</seg>
<seg id="30">Replacement of transport tax on ecological (idea is discussed and concerns all machines) also will support the market, but not so noticeably as customs preferences, considers Pankov.</seg>
<seg id="31">Transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike, for example, from Norway, where the tax cut has led to a sharp rise in sales of electric vehicles - now account for 12% of the market.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia needs and stimulus measures for car owners, for example free parking in the centre of the city (as already made in Moscow), I am sure Pankov, or the possibility of movement of electric vehicles on selected lanes, which in Russia while are not present.</seg>

<seg id="1">The dollar went up on MICEX above 37 rubles on news about upcoming the West new sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="2">This is a new historical record.</seg>
<seg id="3">The dollar calculations "tomorrow" to 10: 29 Moscow time grew to 26.9 kopecks and was 37,02 ruble, the euro was raised by 30 kopeks - up to 48,73 ruble, data of the Moscow stock exchanges.</seg>

<seg id="6">On the night of August 29, the White House announced that US President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel discuss the possibility of introducing additional sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The weakening of the ruble is long-term character, and in tandem with the euro, and in tandem with the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="8">Long-term forecast assumed this mark, "says a senior analyst" Alpari "Anna Bodrov's.</seg>
<seg id="9">Everything that is connected with Ukraine, or otherwise will be reflected on courses.</seg>
<seg id="10">As long as this continues, investors will respond.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today rumors about invasion forces not confirmed nor on the one hand, but the market was very emotional.</seg>
<seg id="12">All talk that he was is resistant to such news, yesterday were перечеркнуты.</seg>
<seg id="13">Week, according to a specialist, will be closed about these levels - 36,90 and 37,05 ruble per dollar.</seg>
<seg id="14">The tax period ended, oil prices weak, politics, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine - all this links of the same chain.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also overclocking is projected inflation: To current prices for autumn eighty percent of from 5 to 10%.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon, moreover, will fizzle out seasonal fruits and vegetables, and there will be a vacuum, while the network are being reoriented toward other suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The dollar went up to 37, has passed its and returned back, a powerful hysteria not," said the head of the department of market analysis "Opening Broker Konstantin Bushuev.</seg>
<seg id="18">Still will look, will enter on Saturday promised sanctions, as will meet NATO.</seg>
<seg id="19">The ruble, he says, sharply weakened after the completion of the tax season, then went news by Ukraine, in addition, the Central Bank said last week that until the end of the year completely passes to floating the currency and disclaims any currency interventions.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you look at day wobble, it nothing different from previous within this month, all have spooked exactly mark in 37 rubles, - continues Skvortsov.</seg>
<seg id="21">And so, in terms of turnover nothing powerful not happened.</seg>
<seg id="22">Alarming times for the currency market were, I remind you, when at the end of January, there has been an increased demand for currency, as well as the third of March, when the Central Bank shipped a record number of currency.</seg>
<seg id="23">In UFS IC see and positive side of the weakening of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="24">First of all, the growth of the budget income from export operations, as well as to increase the competitiveness of domestic producers through rising imports, said the chief analyst UFS IC Aleksey Kozlov.</seg>
<seg id="25">The negative points can be attributed appreciation of imported goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, provoke the growth of inflationary pressures and, as a consequence, the cause of appreciation borrowing funds, which, in turn, slows down the development of the economy of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">If to talk about the stock market, the rouble's depreciation several smoothes over a decrease in the stock price expressed in rubles.</seg>
<seg id="28">For example, the MICEX Index in the process of bargaining Thursday decreased 1.63%, and the RTS Index lost 3.27%.</seg>
<seg id="29">So a substantial difference in the relative size of indices is explained by the weakening of the ruble during the day more than 1.5%.</seg>
<seg id="30">The weakening of the ruble is emotional nature and is explained by mass desire to buy a currency.</seg>
<seg id="31">As practice shows, gradually emotions go to is not present, and quotes the ruble fully or partially restore the lost positions.</seg>
<seg id="32">"We believe, soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles for the dollar," said Aleksey Kozlov.</seg>

<seg id="1">The tax burden on entrepreneurs Washington zones is growing as the economy recovers</seg>
<seg id="2">Восстанавливающаяся economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Account to the paying of taxes to state and local level for companies throughout the country, moderately increased last year, when accelerated economic recovery, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington area is no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">Companies in the area, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion in the treasury of the state and local level in the financial 2013, by 3.8 percent more than $26.6 billion gathered for 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tax burden on business on the state and local level in the past year increased by 4.3 per cent, to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 per cent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year growth after reaching each other years when account disparities, in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">Taxes charged state, grew faster, 4.3 percent, than local taxes, 3.9 per cent, according to the research, which was conducted by providing professional services, Ernst & Young and the Centre for taxation State, group on tax policy.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of tax revenues in the district, 56%, in taxes on business, while 36 percent tax revenues Maryland falls on the company.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the least amount of tax revenues, proportionately, from entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="10">To a large extent, growth in tax revenues caused by return to the same level of value of real estate companies, researchers say that raised taxes on real estate on 3.7 percent this year, after three years in a row, when growth was less than 1 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large share of those revenues fall on large states such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same thing is happening in Washington zone.</seg>
<seg id="12">Companies in the area, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion property taxes to state and local level in the past year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012 - growth of 4.2 percent, compared to the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the observed the return value of the real estate has a similar effect on growth in tax revenues for the state and local level in Maryland, where taxes on real estate hardly exceed one-fifth of tax accounts companies.</seg>
<seg id="14">Company Virginia and District of Columbia pay about half of tax accounts for state and local level in the form of property taxes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"What is happening in Maryland is that such a large part of their property, especially tax base around the District of Columbia, belongs to or government, or non-profit organization, which do not pay taxes on real estate," said Douglas Линдхолм, Executive Director of the Center for taxation state.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, Maryland forced to rely much more, for example, on income taxes to pay for the same service, which have in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully to explain the restoration of the real estate market.</seg>
<seg id="18">Income of entrepreneurs also seems to go on the amendment, according to these data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Company in the region декларировали corporate income tax on the level of the state in the amount of $2.3 billion to $2.1 billion more than in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland collected $1 billion of corporate revenues income tax, most in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although trends are directed in one direction, the tax burden entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase with the same speed in all three areas.</seg>
<seg id="22">The level of growth in the District of Columbia was on the same level as the average for the country, 4.3 percent, while the growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only in Virginia there was an increase tax revenues below average, equal 4.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">In Virginia was the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (each of which the same corporate rate), equal 6 percent.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Maryland corporate bet is 8.25%, while in the area it is relatively high - 9,975 percent.</seg>
<seg id="26">Similar research of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that in Virginia below taxes to the entrepreneurs on the state and local level and, on the whole, a more favorable climate in respect to taxes for entrepreneurs, than in Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="27">District not was estimated in this study.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite its advantage, Virginia is competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south.</seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina recently signed legislation that corporate rate this year with 6.9 percent to 6 percent, as well as in Virginia, and rate will fall to 5 percent in the next year.</seg>

<seg id="2">The debut album of the group Royal Blood - new hope British rock, bit рок-дуэты from clubs directly to the stadiums.</seg>
<seg id="3">Duet Royal Blood just a year on stage, but already has in a nomination to the BBC, tour the Arctic Monkeys and visit to doorframe New York concert from the Jimmy Act.</seg>
<seg id="4">Their debut album, Leif for the several months prior to release received 100 thousand предзаказов, and the contract for his release lies in the portfolio of major Warner Music.</seg>
<seg id="5">Given the current bad situation worse on music market, the situation from downstairs, because it is not about the new Lana Del Rey or another сладкоголосом representative "new R'n'B", and about a duo быковатых in view of the British playing with that level of volume and intensity, which the last time was in fashion a couple of decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">In general, the bets on the first album in connection with all вышеозначенными circumstances were particularly high and already quite dashed.</seg>
<seg id="7">Duet not in vain took a name that before this could infringe except that a desperate hairy metalheads, and blood which kings flows, as it seems to them, they have in veins, also it is clear.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is, of course, first of all the heroes of the past level Led Zeppelin: As the great quartet, Royal Blood strive shake застоявшуюся blood British rock, shutting it to a new level.</seg>
<seg id="9">To make predictions about the success of this company so far, perhaps, quite early, but something to say can already be.</seg>
<seg id="10">A dozen of songs, уложившихся in thirty with a small minutes - it is not so much the demonstration phenomenal composition gifts, how many confident and powerful declaration of intent.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some of the dignity of the individual rooms, of course, deny cannot be: Say, a pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by the fact that is remembered not melodic line, and drum party.</seg>
<seg id="12">Musicians in a joke say that this song in general simply настучать than напеть.</seg>
<seg id="13">Is also a powerful "Little Monster" and provide the disc composition "Better Strangers" with Shakespearean quote in the title.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the truth is that each of these songs will be perfectly sound at a party of fans of heavy rock, but while playing in a row they merge in a more or less homogeneous.</seg>
<seg id="15">And this is not necessarily bad, even on the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="16">The strength of the Royal Blood is that they do not claim the laurels new Lennon and McCartney (rather too метят in successors Motörhead), but made numerous рок-дуэты from the ghetto инди-клубов.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their music, despite some diversity, created for stadiums, in the room directly from less than a couple of thousand people, it obviously closely.</seg>
<seg id="18">The secret of partly in хитром using bass, which has replaced the guitar in the ordinary format, придуманном at the beginning of the zero The White Stripes.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, it is not only in instruments, but also in the approach to writing songs.</seg>
<seg id="20">Heroes ретророка zero with great difficulty are selected beyond the post-modern paradigm, with great reluctance went to recognize themselves not just эпигонами, and independent creative units.</seg>
<seg id="21">Royal Blood same now sound so powerfully and boldly that this pressure successfully драпирует some вторичность and твердолобость music material.</seg>

<seg id="2">Amazon just confirmed what reported Information on Friday morning: Shopping online - and видеопродюсер, and even a hundred other things - buys service streaming видеовоспроизведения Twitch for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).</seg>
<seg id="3">This news was a surprise, not because no one expected that Twitch will be sold, but because many expected that YouTube will be the buyer.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago, selling Twitch видеосервису Google for a good billion looked completely finished, and such a combination of looked natural.</seg>
<seg id="5">Twitch based only three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal to be on-demand service of a general nature - version of YouTube in real time.</seg>
<seg id="6">Instead, he quickly turned into a platform where gamers aired their channel moments; "YouTube for games in real time", according to the Business Insider reported today.</seg>
<seg id="7">Interface Twitch.</seg>
<seg id="8">And let's play ", genre videos, in which всезнайки give (mainly old) games processing, as in" the mysterious theatre ", already popular on YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="9">The fact is that YouTube mentioned often, when describe Twitch, however the news that YouTube acquires Twitch was met by without special interest, a classic example of entrenched technological companies, выкупающей potential rival.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is a mystery why deal with YouTube failed, given that reportedly he was ready to pay not less than Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">All that we have today is a statement from the Executive Director Twitch Emmett Shire: "We have chosen the Amazon, because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us to achieve them faster."</seg>
<seg id="12">Another mystery, frankly speaking, this is an incredible success Twitch.</seg>
<seg id="13">Say like me, who claim that better will be sports, than to watch it, it is hard to understand the attractiveness of the order to watch the game, rather than to take in the hands of the joystick.</seg>
<seg id="14">One thing - to look through a shoulder of the friend at 3 in the morning, while creeping through Resident Evil, and quite another - watch some an outsider receives 20 shots in the head in a row in Call of Duty.</seg>
<seg id="15">All games that you could look right now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another problem is that many of the most popular today games are designed for one person, however watch them shooting, not by controlling the angle of view on their own, can be recipe headache, worthy Do It Right.</seg>
<seg id="17">I agree that high-speed passing in which Роджеры Бэннистеры of our electronic century the whole game in record time, entertain.</seg>
<seg id="18">But if it is not about виртуозе games or humor, it is unlikely that its channel Twitch in general will be interesting.</seg>
<seg id="19">But they know skeptics like me?</seg>
<seg id="20">The Twitch 55 million unique visitors per month, and this is the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.</seg>
<seg id="21">As it is Amazon work on this?</seg>
<seg id="22">It is hard to imagine that Twitch свернется in the Amazon Instant Video as gracefully, as YouTube could simply absorb Twitch.</seg>
<seg id="23">But the Twitch have what'd received any company: The crowd of young men they dream of advertisers.</seg>
<seg id="24">As the head of the Twitch Хайт, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in future games", and this channel shows no sign of withering, even - Oh - as a spectator sport.</seg>

<seg id="39">Санкционное menu</seg>
<seg id="40">On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of individual economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which is called in the main food sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="41">In the country non-smoking import beef, pork meat and sub-products of poultry meat delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yoghurt, cheese, cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.</seg>
<seg id="42">The restaurants began jockeying seems with suppliers: Prices for products have grown, need to urgently look for counterparts from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="43">This will affect the most expensive restaurants with монокухней France, Italy, Spain, in which products supplied directly from the "maternal" countries.</seg>
<seg id="44">Had to change course and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="45">For example, when in early 2014 the Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and a year earlier - the American and Canadian meat.</seg>
<seg id="46">In return suppliers have established supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay, and New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="47">But sanctions лета-2014 were much more serious.</seg>
<seg id="48">True, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree that infer from the ban fry Atlantic salmon and trout, безлактозное milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for replanting.</seg>
<seg id="49">The Italian Valerio hopes that sanctions may still смягчиться.</seg>
<seg id="50">As long as part of the restaurants there is in conditions of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="51">According to the company "East-West", one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.</seg>
<seg id="52">"Expensive restaurants will have to change menu under that produce local farmers and other countries," says Sergei Mironov, restaurant, the owner of the agency "Рестконсалт."</seg>
<seg id="53">If the chef strong, for him it would not be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="54">Only we have very little such chefs, and on the development of a new menu may take two to three months.</seg>
<seg id="55">Тригель from the restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" to this ready: To have to from 10-15% dishes, even half of the menu - process.</seg>
<seg id="56">In restaurants with mixed kitchen are already beginning to replace dishes, such as marble beef steak, Beef Stroganoff, says Sergey Mironov.</seg>
<seg id="57">"Cheeses from Europe you can replace Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," lists the representative of "East-West" Oksana Глибчук.</seg>
<seg id="58">Cream and the milk products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="59">Chicken from the US can be replaced by chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and only from Norway - salmon, семгой, trout from Belarus and Chile.</seg>
<seg id="60">The absence of vegetables and fruits of the European manufacture can be offset by products domestic producers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.</seg>
<seg id="61">According to Mironov, budget network restaurants adjust will be easier than a premium segment: It is unlikely that there were gourmets, capable to distinguish Italian моцареллу from Russian.</seg>
<seg id="62">Although it is difficult to have to institutions Ginza Project, he said.</seg>
<seg id="63">The Ginza Project several dozens of restaurants under different brands and with its menu.</seg>
<seg id="64">To replace it will take a lot of time, "says Mironov.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the Ginza from comments refused, citing lack of owners in the country.</seg>
<seg id="66">The owners of the Caucasus and central Asian cuisine stress that products from former Soviet republics ароматнее European</seg>
<seg id="67">But many and restaurants, which sanctions practically does not affect.</seg>
<seg id="68">These include institutions with kitchen CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.</seg>
<seg id="69">"In Georgian kitchen is not present expensive products," says Khatuna Колбая, who is the owner of the Georgian restaurants variety Superavi and cafe "Vai DOE!".</seg>
<seg id="70">All cheese for us do in Russia, in the basis of many dishes - chicken fillet, exotic greenery we do not use ".</seg>
<seg id="71">In institutions Колбаи has not removed from the menu no dishes.</seg>
<seg id="72">Timur Ланского, owner of restaurants "tea N1" with Uzbek cuisine, sanctions, too, might alert: To change to it will only be implemented in New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="73">If Russia our imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we even win in price, for us it would be cheaper than imports from Europe, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="74">From CIS can be cheaper to receive a clip, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit.</seg>
<seg id="75">At the same time that are brought from Central Asia, much better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="76">About Uzbek tomatoes all know that they tasty, sweet.</seg>
<seg id="77">About Spanish no one does not speak.</seg>
<seg id="78">After the introduction of the sanctions representative of the Ministries of Agriculture of Uzbekistan Олимбой Артыков said that plans to increase exports плодовоовощной products in Russia twice by 2016.</seg>
<seg id="79">About its intention to replace European imports in Russia almost immediately after the sanctions stated Belarus and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="80">Restaurants fast, who responded to a request "Deneg", is also quite calmly react to sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="81">The McDonald's stated that localization exceeds 85% and network works with 160 Russian suppliers.</seg>

<seg id="3">The Bank of Russia has developed draft guidance, according to which from 1 September this year to receive payments on Casco insured | | | can do without help.</seg>
<seg id="4">This, however, is only about cases where the accident was designed by "европротоколу" without the participation of traffic police.</seg>
<seg id="5">That is, if the accident there were only two cars, there is no physically affected persons, damage does not exceed the limit and both driver reached an agreement on who the culprit accident.</seg>
<seg id="6">With 2 August limit payments on "европротоколу" is 50 thousand rubles, and from October 1, in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and also in the Moscow and Leningrad oblasts he will be increased up to 400 thousand rubles.</seg>
<seg id="7">The bottom line is that often even with minor damage, in a situation where the traffic accident can be on "европротоколу", drivers, caught in an accident, cause.</seg>
<seg id="8">After all, if there are policy Casco get on it compensation without help traffic was impossible.</seg>
<seg id="9">Parameters, prescription in the project, as once and are designed to eliminate this obstacle on the way of introduction of "европротокола" in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to them, the maximum payout on Casco in connection with the accident, without police, must not be lower than the limit on the "европротоколу."</seg>
<seg id="11">But it cannot be and higher limit defined in the contract of insurance Casco.</seg>
<seg id="12">The idea, of course, useful and theoretically able to unload as employees SDP and roads.</seg>
<seg id="13">But, most likely, it does not come in delight nor motorists, nor insurers.</seg>
<seg id="14">The last now talk about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, to which can bring the introduction of new rules payments on Casco.</seg>
<seg id="15">As for drivers, it is hard to imagine, what kind of work will have to be done to overcome исконный Russian conservatism.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driver in most cases will be hours wait for inspectors to make small accident because more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="17">And it is still unknown, that will be easier - win fraudsters or convince drivers in reliability of "европротокола."</seg>

<seg id="19">The Ministry of Finance wants to ban savings certificates, but will allow banks to make them an analogue безотзывного contribution.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Finance Ministry is preparing the bill, which would prohibit savings certificates to bearer.</seg>
<seg id="21">Recently, this tool is gaining popularity, because the bet here is higher than on bank deposits.</seg>
<seg id="22">The fact is that savings certificates for not fall into the system of deposit insurance, and bank they cost less, as not to do payments to the Deposit Insurance Agency (pointed).</seg>
<seg id="23">A certain piquancy was added to the situation that this step is planned to take due to small and medium-sized banks, distributing such certificates, and will suffer from it Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which, according to pointed control 98% of specialized market.</seg>
<seg id="24">With a share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the agencies, is about 3.5%.</seg>
<seg id="25">The problem, explain in pointed is that customers a small bank, bought such a certificate, in case you withdraw the license are trying to obtain money in pointed.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some investors, not having enough financial literacy and buying savings certificates, can assume that their investments are insured.</seg>
<seg id="27">Informed the absence of insurance payments on these certificates in the case of the license revocation the bank can cause misunderstandings and social tension.</seg>

<seg id="32">Because these accounts are not fall into the system of deposit insurance, but on their existence while nobody encroaches.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is likely that certificates bearer negotiable instruments are very convenient security, which actually can act in a role of the квазиденег.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the same time, moving them practically does not give in to the control: Any client of the bank can buy certificate, transfer of any citizen, and up to the withdrawal of the certificate can change a lot of masters.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is not by chance that in the draft that savings certificate must be a valuable paper, which must be stored in depository.</seg>
<seg id="36">But to sweeten pill banks, such certificates are allowed to produce without the right of early redemption.</seg>

<seg id="1">Met two Union</seg>
<seg id="2">The top-level talks in Minsk is not decided to problems for which were convened, but gave rise to a new format: The first person of the European Union met with the leaders of the future of the Eurasian</seg>
<seg id="3">Let and disturbing about (the situation around Ukraine very urgent does not tolerate), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of "hot problems."</seg>
<seg id="4">Whether this structure to work effectively, it is unclear; but it is clear who took cream with this summit.</seg>
<seg id="5">Questions on this account the Entente evening 26 August, when the Belarusians, and after them and other евразийцы with Europeans saw in May a new president Lukashenko.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Belarusian leader revealed example polished учтивости, it was human behavior, which only that tore off the jackpot - and plans to a decent old age in the highest society.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Maidan Lukashenko helped</seg>
<seg id="8">Arrival in Minsk at once three main European commissioners (ministers of the EU), which met with Lukashenka and allowed him to act at the final briefing on their behalf - not just legitimization President with a 20-years experience.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is an application for recognition of Minsk a sovereign member of the European policy and the main mediator of Ukrainian crisis.</seg>
<seg id="10">Senior analyst at the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies Denis Мельянцов sure: From now on Brussels will not have to talk to Minsk in the same tone as before.</seg>
<seg id="11">"What Catherine Ashton met tete-a-tete with Lukashenka, gives reason to believe that the relations with the EU will be размораживаться and further," he said "огоньку."</seg>
<seg id="12">The tip of the iceberg have hidden part: Training to breaking through the Belarusian authorities started long before November Maidan in Kiev - summer 2013-го.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Were achieved results and with the EU is a successful negotiations on simplification of the visa regime and readmission, dialogues on modernization, - lists interlocutor Ogonyok - and with the US were held negotiations on international security.</seg>
<seg id="14">States even took a little sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="15">As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and response to Belarus only invoked another influx of this process.</seg>
<seg id="16">Minsk, on the one hand, managed to keep relations with Ukraine is warm enough not to much to lose in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, which de jure do not recognized joining of Crimea to Russia and called on to punish pro-Russian militias in Donbas with all the severity, not quarreled and with Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="18">Minsk any of the Customs Union, nor of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, and in Baranovichi is placed the Russian air base.</seg>
<seg id="19">Brussels and Washington noticed a balanced position of Minsk on Ukrainian issue - and appreciated it, sure the Belarusian experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">No matter how successful is the movement of Lukashenka to political diversification, will be seen by how often in the near future Minsk have the opportunity to take a meeting in the format of the EU + TS.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the press service of the High Representative of the Union for foreign policy and diplomacy Catherine Ashton failed to answer questions about what Brussels expects relations in the new format.</seg>
<seg id="22">A spokesman for the Ashton Maya Косьянчич only said "огоньку" that on the background of solving issues of war and peace this theme is not a priority.</seg>
<seg id="23">This indicated that the next meeting place for Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in a new format can become and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="24">A drop of tar for Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that this his, it turns out, personally asked the representatives of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nevertheless, at the final briefing Alexander Lukashenko made clear: All parties not against to Minsk remained central platform for meetings as in the format of Россия--ОБСЕ--Украина and at the level of heads of states and high representatives of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="26">This means that "the last dictator in Europe" acquires the status of quite рукопожатного European leader, which helps to solve global problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">Best friend European farmer</seg>
<seg id="28">The delegation of the EU, which included еврокомиссаров on trade and energy, pushed to the conclusion: The main underlying reason for the summit is not a tragic situation in Donbas, and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="29">In fact, сверстанное at the meeting schedule of future negotiations on gas supplies and to overcome fears the CU on the agreement about an association of Ukraine with the EU looks achievement more extensive than peace Declaration without specific dates and figures.</seg>
<seg id="30">Trade Commissioner Charles De Карел nevertheless, outlined: Representatives of the EU "arrived in Minsk to look for a solution to the political crisis, which has economic consequences, not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="31">It seems, however, that in the economy crisis in Ukraine "works" in Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its consequences - and in the first place mutual Western sanctions and Russia - give Minsk, which until he is experiencing санкционное pressure, the long-awaited room for maneuver.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to the head of Mises Research Center, a former presidential candidate in Belarus August, European investors are more interested in opportunities of Belarus for the supply of agricultural products in the Russian Federation to evade sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="34">When this are the delivery scheme for which Vladimir Putin at the summit offered Minsk.</seg>
<seg id="35">"The these schemes," said Ramanchuk "огоньку," are not the Belarusian businessmen, and Russian companies.</seg>
<seg id="36">They long practised schemes supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Russian business urgently needs to somehow to restore them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.</seg>
<seg id="38">The second story, - continues to expert, is connected with the fact that many Ukrainian companies to establish production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials also with orientation on the Russian market.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Ukrainian producers about 4 billion exports to Russia, and the Belarusian производственно-торговые schemes now can be very popular. "</seg>
<seg id="40">According to Ramanchuk, the role of the master site for negotiations, the EU and the CU is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of the development of economic ties with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="41">He recalls that the loss of the agrarian sector the EU from sanctions Moscow are estimated at 5 to 10 billion euros, and the European Commission is currently offered аграриям only 125 million euros compensation.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Belarusian president can offer Brussels work together to minimize the consequences for еврофермеров.</seg>
<seg id="43">This can raise the authority of the Lukashenka in the EU at the extraordinary height.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hospitality without initiatives</seg>
<seg id="45">Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold a summit meeting.</seg>
<seg id="46">But the paradox is that the official Minsk from its active role in birth format TC + the EU открещивается, and the Belarusian leader at the meeting with Ukrainian counterpart stressed that the new format and became Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="47">"It was your offer to gather, without any навала discuss, not with бухты-барахты decide, after the signing of the Treaty on the association with the EU, understand the situation, which at the time was in Ukraine", "he before the cameras to Peter Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, observers interpreted it as an attempt to mollify Moscow, she reportedly was initially against the mediation of Minsk, which considerably increases its political weight.</seg>
<seg id="49">In the Belarusian diplomatic Department diligently emphasize that Belarus at the organization of interaction between the EU and TC on their land not pursuing lucrative goals, and the ultimate goal of such format - creation of in the future a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.</seg>
<seg id="50">"This is absolutely in a spirit of those concepts that in other areas, in particular in the sphere of security, puts forward and promotes the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation," said "огоньку" in the Foreign Ministry of Belarus, Department, where recently to select words.</seg>

<seg id="2">The film Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez "City грехов-2: A woman, for which it is worth to kill" was not the revolution that it could be expected.</seg>
<seg id="3">The first "City of sins" (2005), directed at minimum, but symbolic, participation of Goods, made a revolution in the relations between cinema, comic books and literary нуаром.</seg>
<seg id="4">The sequel also революционен: In the sense that it destroys a fundamental for the modern thinking chain "the" synthesis "(if you understand thesis universe Нуара, and under the antithesis has - space comic book).</seg>
<seg id="5">From now on, it should be read: "The" chaos ".</seg>
<seg id="6">"The city грехов-2" chaotic and драматургическом, and on the philosophical grade: Both times he chaotic in a bad mood sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="7">Yes, part of the heroes are familiar with the first "the City", though, that is, громила Марв (Mickey Rourke), as far as I remember, finished life on electric chair, and here, nothing, only and have enough time to rile - in the role of such popular дружинника - from the air knives and other axes with удавками.</seg>
<seg id="8">But the elderly literally you have elbows beginners, as if вломившиеся in the city from some other film about the meaning and plot which spectators are asked not to worry.</seg>
<seg id="9">So, has its own history, shamelessly оборванная authors on the very interesting place, суперудачливого player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt's).</seg>
<seg id="10">Its own - похотливо-фригидной Eve Lord (Eva Green) and for something as the avenging her Dwight (Josh Бролин).</seg>
<seg id="11">But this confusion in which Dwight in, say, a person not distinguish from Johnny - the more that person, as well as other parts of the body, characters endure the with an implacable arming regularity, not a problem and not even only half the problem.</seg>
<seg id="12">This is not a people, we understand that this archetypes Нуара: Женщина sure that everything works smoothly, too confident player, угодивший in "медовую trap" sex detective, corrupt упырь-сенатор.</seg>
<seg id="13">Well, and when archetype вальсирует with archetype погоняет and archetype, then this is not cinema, and read the abstract painting.</seg>
<seg id="14">And ask the abstract painting questions about logic story simply ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="15">Moreover, even in this суматошном world have something permanent.</seg>
<seg id="16">Combat whores from the first Cities "still kept circling from осаждающих their native slums forces of darkness.</seg>
<seg id="17">Yes, and the specter of detective Хартигана no no yes and will come to, and Bruce Willis it's always nice to look at.</seg>
<seg id="18">The main problem of Cities грехов-2 "lies elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="19">Frank Miller was good, because both рисовальщик talented joined comic and Noir, and as a stage director turned the idea of how to migrate comics on the screen.</seg>
<seg id="20">Comic and | | | - two aggressively opposite "reality."</seg>
<seg id="21">Comic phenomenon in the modern form was born in the end of the 1920 ’ s, then, when the novels Дэшила Хэммета "Mary harvest" (1929), "screen" (1930) and "Glass key" (1931) have created a canon Нуара, именовавшегося then hard-boiled school - "steep school."</seg>
<seg id="22">Well or pulp fiction.</seg>
<seg id="23">Comics gave Hollywood many tens of heroes: From морячка Попая - one spinach, gives him a mighty force, Superman, Batman and сыскаря Dick Tracy to Hulk, the Torah, Spider-Man and other "мстителей."</seg>
<seg id="24">But in any film based on comic book there was something intrinsically: Painted characters stubbornly did not want to getting screen flesh, remained притворяшками in their willy-nilly "real" world.</seg>
<seg id="25">Simply put, they were left without "life".</seg>
<seg id="26">| | |, by contrast, the existential genre of world literature.</seg>
<seg id="27">After the world wars traditional novel - with experiences, personalities, family scandals and historical background - has lost all credibility.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Форсайты which II and | | |, what even Болконские and attended in general just after Вердена, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?</seg>
<seg id="29">Such a novel peacefully mutated into the format of the soap opera was, and the criminal - that is, by definition, marginalized - novel rose to the level of philosophical prose.</seg>
<seg id="30">| | | on their skin learned that such work санитаром at the front.</seg>
<seg id="31">He was a communist.</seg>
<seg id="32">As, by the way, were, at least, close to the Communist Party and such pillars of the genre, as writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassin, Joseph Джозеф Edward Дмитрик.</seg>
<seg id="33">However Noir, archetype which they asked, first, rude and cynical, and second - a purely social.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is almost no American variant of social realism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The first "City of sins" was remarkable exactly what unnatural, but organically joined comic with нуаром.</seg>
<seg id="36">For the first time on the screen comic came alive, with a straight face its graphical nature, not pretended "real" movie.</seg>
<seg id="37">Darkness sales of the world, where Cardinal ordered the killing, and Senator wrapped monstrous сына-садиста, was quite worthy of the pen Хэммета.</seg>
<seg id="38">And picturesque details like cut heads, which садист декорировал their small cocoon, pen genius James Ellroy novel, the author of "Black orchids" and better - i.e. declaratively тошнотворного - representative неонуара.</seg>
<seg id="39">"The city грехов-2" - it is not even retreat, and surrender by the radical style Миллера--Родригеса before tradition the comics.</seg>
<seg id="40">Probably, in many respects this was due to technologies 3D.</seg>
<seg id="41">When you look the second "City of sins", you feel yourself in a glass ball, inside which snow falls asleep toy клоаку.</seg>
<seg id="42">However, most often it is not the snow, and bloody charred, but by and large what's the difference?</seg>
<seg id="43">Well, and about the environment and say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="44">Because it is possible only when somewhere, in some places we have sometimes, even on the sidelines dirty swamps, but there is a normal world, where you can return пошедшую on curve track girl or, say, say murmured, in a disconsolate undertone parents that its губитель punished.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin requires from Kiev to start negotiations on "state" eastern Ukraine</seg>
<seg id="2">According to the Russian news reports about his observations, Russian President Vladimir Putin has demanded on Sunday to the Ukrainian government stopped fights with separatists in the east of the country and immediately began talks about the "state" отделившегося region.</seg>
<seg id="3">His press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin had in mind the hint that восточноукраинская territory under the control of the separatists will become a part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine should be revised to give русскоговорящему region to defend their rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">But the call Putin to Kyiv government to start negotiations with pro-Russian insurgents as with equal to obvious strategy, which he should since the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: Help separatists take territory and force the Ukrainian government give новопровозглашенной territory Novorossiya de facto independence to get closer to Russia, and not with the West.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with the state Channel 1 TV Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return retained separatists territory in the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk areas that were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed Ukrainian peninsula Crimea on 18 March.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists recently called the seized territories of a Новороссией, or New Russia, name, which refers to the дореволюционным days of the glory of Russian Empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin said that any who believe that peace talks will occur in the near future, when the Ukrainian politicians begin to campaign for parliamentary elections on October 26, and, while government forces attack peace settlements in the detained separatists regions - "Зенды illusions," Itar-Tass reported.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We must immediately start meaningful negotiations and not only on technical issues, but also on the future political structure of society and the state status of south-eastern Ukraine, to meet the interests of people living there," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Sands said that make about statehood Putin had in mind in the context of a broad autonomy, which was discussed during the months with leaders in Kiev in an effort to allay fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and language rights in danger.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian government can give to the eastern regions of the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is not a question to discuss between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and internal Ukrainian conflict."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Kremlin's press secretary intervention to adjust to "incorrect interpretation of" words Putin underscored the decision of the Russian leadership to behave towards separatist uprising in the east otherwise than open capture of Crimea, where most 2-миллионного population are ethnic Russians.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would have had to endure far more heavy battle to attach even Donetsk and Луганскую area of eastern Ukraine, as most of 6.5 million people not the Russians, and polls before the conflict showed broad support desire to remain within Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">Autonomy, which Russian diplomats discussed at international forums gave would regional governments in Ukraine power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy, in essence, passing the Kremlin actual control over the territory which would one the main territory of Russia from Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the Black Sea peninsula, присоединенном five months ago, is the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historical sea resorts.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the regions between Russian Rostov region and Crimea are also mines, factories and melting plants that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested during his inauguration speech, 7 June to Ukrainian lawmakers after new elections взвесили amendments to the Constitution to give those regions more control over their finances and status languages.</seg>
<seg id="18">But his view on autonomy, it seems, is very different from the view of the Kremlin and повстанцев-сепаратистов, weapons and incitement of Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="19">The last call Putin to Kiev to agree with Chechen separatist leaders, as with equal, followed the new наступлениями insurgents last week after Russian troops and tanks entered the eastern Ukraine from before peaceful area along the Sea of Azov.</seg>
<seg id="20">Russian-backed separatists took control of the city | | | in the occurrence of which the Ukrainian Security Service said that fear that he is the beginning of the campaign to capture strategic coastal territory to the Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="21">The large-scale civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, steel port with 500,000, which is located between Новоазовском and narrow on the Crimean peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko on Saturday turned to a meeting of the leaders of the European Union in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which was an independent 23 years.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We are approaching the point of no return," warned Poroshenko.</seg>
