<seg id="6">changing the law on regulation of labour relations in such a way as to allow the workers encountering discrimination for participation in trade union organizations, to seek justice in the civil courts, and compensation and punitive damages payments - a sensible and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">but it 's certainly not radical initiative - at least by American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">in fact, the best way to understand the fact that offer Ellison, Lewis and co-authors of the bill, "recall is a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">despite the attacks, which the unions have in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country, Americans once supported countries all over the world to adopt, to expand and to respect human rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">there was a time, which is still remembered by millions of Americans, when this country simultaneously defend democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.</seg>
<seg id="11">when the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas MacArthur and his assistants have helped the country to adopt a constitution, to ensure that balanced state autocracy Хидеки Тодзё was replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included text that explicitly admitted that "the right of workers to organize and to negotiate, and the collective action is guaranteed."</seg>
<seg id="13">when the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Эйзенхауер and his assistants have helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that fascism Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">recognizing that workers will need to be organized and be heard in the new state, the Germans have included an article that openly stated: "the right to form associations with the aim to protect and improve employment and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.</seg>
<seg id="15">agreements that restrict or seek to diminish that right, will have no legal force; measures to these objectives will be deemed illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">when former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which was World Declaration on Human Rights, which in 1948, will be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the added that "everyone has the right to organize and join unions to protect their interests."</seg>

<seg id="18">when this country is advised by other countries about how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans have explained that the right to organize labor unions - and the fact that this union has participated as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - should be protected.</seg>

<seg id="2">in the U.S., a federal judge on Sunday temporarily has blocked the introduction of the Louisiana law, which his supporters say that he, most likely, will close all five абортных clinics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">according to this measure, which was signed by the Governor of Louisiana Bobby Джинадлом in June and was supposed to go into effect on 1 September, doctors who do abortions, were obliged to have powers of patients in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">nevertheless, the judge 's decision means that, at the moment, doctors can continue to make legal abortion, while continuing to look for such powers.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally, continuing actions to gain power," he wrote in his decision, Judge John деГрэвеллз.</seg>
<seg id="6">a hearing will be scheduled within the next month, in which a judge or a more permanent solution on this law.</seg>
<seg id="7">advocates for abortion rights decision was met with joy, the latest in a chain of decisions against similar measures, saying it will give doctors more time to receive hospital authority.</seg>
<seg id="8">"today 's decision ensures that the women will be protected from one Louisiana law, which seeks to deprive them of the health and human rights," said Nancy Нортап, president and head of the Center for reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the state 's five clinics.</seg>
<seg id="9">it was not immediately clear whether the decision to the doctors from two clinics that do not give claimants in the case, and also filed an application for the authority.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, and the courts recently acknowledged such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="11">key parts of texas law, which would have shut most of the remaining clinics in this state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">fighters for the right to abortion, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association say that the laws of the receiving authority to impose restrictions, doctors are not necessary from the medical point of view.</seg>

<seg id="14">only one doctor who does abortions in Louisiana, is in the hospital, according to the Center for reproductive Rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">if all the other doctors in the state will be forced to stop performing the procedure, the doctor, fearing for their safety, would no longer perform this procedure, the group said.</seg>

<seg id="1">what will the introduction of quotas for domestic products</seg>
<seg id="2">no less than half of the products for each type of product in the range trading networks should be the Russian production, says Duma deputy from Just Russia, Oleg Nilov has informed about.</seg>
<seg id="3">the MP has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures for domestic manufacturers, writes the newspaper Izvestia.</seg>
<seg id="4">the document will still детализироваться to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.</seg>
<seg id="5">this applies to goods that are produced in Russia. <... > According to the rest of the groups of products, which are produced in Russia, should be to provide the no less than half of its production to domestic producers, "Nilov has informed about publishing.</seg>
<seg id="6">together with the amendments, in the article "On the basis of state regulation of trading activities in the Russian Federation," the bill provides for the introduction of changes to the Tax Code, laying down religious VAT rate of 10% for products produced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">the idea to introduce a 50% quota -процентную in trade networks included in the stimulus package for Russian producers.</seg>
<seg id="8">the shop will be several times more than domestic goods.</seg>
<seg id="9">however, this initiative can have both a positive and a negative effect, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="10">according to the company 's lawyer "Налоговик", a member of an independent expert Center "Public Duma Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive in nature, and will lead to growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">the advantage will be key, farmers, and small shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">they will be able to sell more, and it means that profits will grow.</seg>
<seg id="13">in addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms to retailers and prices, because they will be forced to buy their goods.</seg>
<seg id="14">Russian manufacturers will be able to increase the volume of its sales activities and that will lead to pay higher taxes than before.</seg>
<seg id="15">it will increase revenue, create new jobs, any industry will grow any faster in, will be made to contribute to the growth of GDP.</seg>
<seg id="16">Russia 's dependence on foreign food to fall a few times, but not immediately, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="17">earlier, Russian companies are often unable to fight their way to the shelves of local stores due to higher competition from foreign counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="18">now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche and freed you can breathe a sigh of relief.</seg>
<seg id="19">but do not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary inspections on food products to the Russian market will come from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="20">in other words, it is now "calm" moment, when the players have already left, and new ones not yet come.</seg>
<seg id="21">almost a month later, you can talk about four domestic demand for raw materials, as well as rising prices for finished products, "said АиФ.ru first Vice President of Russian public institutions," the Russian club financial directors, "Tamara Kasyanov.</seg>
<seg id="22">clearly, the idea of selling in each category at least 50% of the Russian food products will help to consolidate the sector for local producers.</seg>
<seg id="23">in that case, they will have to compete with one another, not with products that subsidies at the expense of another state, are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="24">in other words, the fight for customers will unfold between companies in the same industry.</seg>
<seg id="25">on the other hand, says Kasyanov, Russian producers are able to meet 50% of domestic needs compatriots not on all items.</seg>
<seg id="26">and in this situation commercial networks will have "дотягивать" share of Russian goods up to half of the range.</seg>
<seg id="27">in connection with this increase concerns that substandard goods on the shelves).</seg>
<seg id="28">perhaps under the guise of produced in Russia will be supplied with labels перебитыми foreign products, "adds an expert.</seg>
<seg id="29">the negative effect of the introduction of the tariff quotas, large retail chains, especially those that выгодней cooperate with importers.</seg>
<seg id="30">it is logical that, when such a scenario will suffer and foreign suppliers, because the demand for their products.</seg>
<seg id="31">Litvinenko did not rule out that the law on quotas on domestic goods may impact on consumers.</seg>
<seg id="32">the fact is that some of the Russian-made products can yield quality imported ones, while shops will be boosting prices on the second as a scarce commodity.</seg>
<seg id="33">the long-forgotten early in the 2000s, the idea of import substitution economists started talking again in February this year because of the ongoing devaluation of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="34">now, amid the uneasy relations with the West, the issue of the import of products becomes even more urgent.</seg>
<seg id="35">the law aims to compel retailers to suppliers under orders from domestic producers.</seg>
<seg id="36">then we go much faster and more confident on the path of import substitution and the planning system is necessary for the production of products will be created in a shorter period of time, "says MP Oleg Nilov has informed about.</seg>
<seg id="37">especially effective mechanism be quotas for the agricultural sector, where the potential is particularly high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.</seg>
<seg id="38">our farmers are able to fully cover the shelves in Russian shops.</seg>

<seg id="5">according to the latest forecast, inflation in 2014 will be 6,5-7,5% the following year - less than the 6.5 per cent.</seg>

<seg id="7">according to the publication, the agency may lower the inflation rate in 2015 that will eliminate progeSOFT expected revenue growth of the population.</seg>
<seg id="8">in the forecast, it was assumed that the food sanctions apply a year - until August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">in such a situation, you could assume such high inflation?</seg>
<seg id="10">the current situation is a shock, but geared понижательный trend of inflation does not change, "said the source of the newspaper so far.</seg>
<seg id="11">economists from VTB Capital "don 't share expectations regarding inflation and government economic bloc forecast price growth in 2014 at the level of 8%.</seg>

<seg id="16">Artem Деев, head of research at FC AForex:</seg>
<seg id="17">prices have already observed in key segments.</seg>
<seg id="18">moreover, when I began to appreciate the socially relevant products, the government has been forced to launch measures to monitor systemic risks to price stability, in order to prevent unreasonable price increases in the short term.</seg>
<seg id="19">suppliers and retailers already report on a daily basis before regulators that the authorities knew exactly who, where and for what reason will trigger an increase in prices.</seg>
<seg id="20">key factors for the growth of the consumer price index continues to be tremendous pace of capital flight, excessive refinancing the banking sector from the Russian мегарегулятора, internal convert due to escape in foreign currency, as well as an embargo on the import of food products from the countries that joined the sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="21">if inflationary pressures remained under control, the cost of a minimum basket of food has not jumped to 12 per cent in just one quarter.</seg>
<seg id="22">the ban on the import of food products provoked shock proposals on the internal market and led to a higher final cost логичному.</seg>
<seg id="23">because at this stage we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, and increase the size of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production, sanctions will continue to bear the risks the growth response of the inflationary component.</seg>
<seg id="24">if you add another here and fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as ухудшенными prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year, inflation could exceed 8%.</seg>
<seg id="25">Alexander Разуваев, director of the analytical department "Alpari."</seg>
<seg id="26">in the 1990s, inflation sometimes hit 20-30% per month to zero, it was also higher than current levels, another thing that then it is offset by rapid economic growth.</seg>

<seg id="29">an external factor associated with sanctions against Russia, while successfully contained, but if there is a further increase of the pressure, first of all, the financial sector - this can lead to certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations, which are traditionally cash purchases in foreign currency to protect their savings.</seg>
<seg id="30">it can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance will try to smooth the weakening rouble, as market practices and government regulation.</seg>
<seg id="31">but prices traditionally begins after the summer lull, and perhaps this fall will become more pronounced.</seg>

<seg id="14">"RSL" told the head of a construction company, "Anatoly Профи-инвест Демьянко estimated that regulations are outdated, but the mechanism has not yet suggested another business.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as far as the proposed settlements for the constructive elements, in practice this is implementable, because the building has often used different technologies," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">it is no secret that стройрынок is largely thanks to госзаказу.</seg>
<seg id="17">according to the Chairman of the Board "NP Экспертное Community procurement professionals" Catherine Лезиной, today, the state is the most effective customer.</seg>
<seg id="18">deputy director of the pharmaceutical industry ’ s centre of capital construction Vladimir Malakhov drew attention to the fact that, today, the market is divided into the companies, which have access to a portfolio of contracts, and the company that owns outsourced competence and does not allow for this field of competitors.</seg>
<seg id="19">he believes that the creation of a transparent market is only possible when access to contracts will be as Turkey manager from someone 's impact.</seg>
<seg id="20">however, the council was asked to form a government in such a way that one and the same performer may not receive more than one contract worth more than 1 billion rubles, or several contracts worth more than $1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="21">in минстрое believe that this approach must be evaluated from the point of view of the impact on business, as well as the efficiency of the management of the construction.</seg>
<seg id="22">as explained by Elena Zhukova, in this case, you must be given of the general contractor functions, which will lead to an increase of the budget and spending on its content.</seg>
<seg id="23">the customer will need to have the knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by contractors, as well as their security.</seg>
<seg id="24">often this is down to determine who is responsible for the security of an object as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="25">in addition, this approach may result in the outflow of highly skilled participants in connection with the state in obtaining state drogerie order for part-time work and a small amount of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="26">the deputy head of the Institute of procurement экспертно-консультационного Alexander Евсташенков believes that right now, the government has turned to business to Scor contractor.</seg>
<seg id="27">and this example: "a participant when completing the application must indicate" specific performance "without the words" or equivalent "," should "," "," "more," "less than," "similar" "or", "type", "a similar type," "lower," "lower," "higher," "can," "may," "might," "earlier" and "not previously," "higher," "not allowed" and so on.</seg>
<seg id="28">thus, customers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of applications of contractors.</seg>
<seg id="29">another problem, according to 44-ФЗ Евсташенкова, was the need to assess the quality of application through the "paper" proposal.</seg>
<seg id="30">considering the application, you can really only assess a qualified contractor, but not the quality of the work, in which not even began, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="31">the quality of the works can be assessed only on their acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="32">however, the council also was asked to take a margin income from the top to the lower echelon to intermediate contractors.</seg>
<seg id="33">chairman of the Expert Council, State Secretary, espionage FAS Andrei Цариковский believes that it should not, as responsible for the order should генподрядчик.</seg>
<seg id="34">but otherwise, as in the famous репризе Arkady Raikin normalises sleeping: "пуговицам claims to have?"</seg>

<seg id="25">in contrast to Tatiana offers guests the roommate out of the apartment, No. 6 Lyudmila Старостиной.</seg>
<seg id="26">nice friendly woman with threshold offers up a cup of coffee and with a sad smile said:</seg>
<seg id="27">we have a one-bedroom apartment, 14.5 m ² for four people, and we live with her husband and daughter with his granddaughter.</seg>

<seg id="41">in this apartment (room!) lived for an entire dynasty: my grandparents, my mom and dad, I 'm with my husband and my daughter with his granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="42">things happened during that time.</seg>
<seg id="43">for example, здоровенные rats ran in the kitchen.</seg>

<seg id="45">they say the solution was involved on the eggs, so long rests.</seg>
<seg id="46">House built thoroughly Демидовым, thank you!</seg>
<seg id="47">perhaps, but so far no one killed or сваей crumbling ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="48">only construction still slowly dying in front of us: boards and log house гниют, floors have repeatedly failed, we are pouring cement, but all of it - the solution goes into the ground, as well.</seg>

<seg id="2">never say, "I love you"</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was one of seven children born to a family of immigrants from Jamaica in Dudley in Мидлендс in 1958.</seg>
<seg id="4">his father, who died when Henry was 19, he worked in a factory, and their relationship has been limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry репетирует comedy, "Rare records Rudi," which partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of programmes on Radio 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">the soundtrack is a mix of 199.4 and rap, and melodies - жизнерадостны.</seg>
<seg id="7">but Henry had to get through some difficult memories of childhood.</seg>
<seg id="8">after the death of his mother was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often mused about the relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">it was very inaccessible.</seg>
<seg id="10">you never saw his face, you only hear his voice: "don 't make noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">отстань from sisters.</seg>
<seg id="12">шевелись!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch the cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">my older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were older, when I was a child, walked with him in the pub and talk about such things as a form of beer glasses, the beauty of the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">I have never talked with him.</seg>
<seg id="16">he was so неулыбчивым guy in the corner, reading a newspaper which is a big part of my life.</seg>
<seg id="17">Henry recently opened the studio are in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in the days of his father, he was able to take a look at what must have been his life.</seg>
<seg id="18">now there 's a little bit better, but it is dark, дымные labyrinths 'full extent of Hell, with outbreaks of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">my father залезал in a bathtub and just lay there, and you have heard, as he slowly begins to sing about himself, because he wanted to отмыться mould from the studio.</seg>
<seg id="20">when I came back, I realised that he was doing this for years and years, to earn money for food, and I began to appreciate it more.</seg>
<seg id="21">nevertheless, Henry came from a childhood devoid of parental love.</seg>
<seg id="22">my father never cuddled, never said, "I love you."</seg>
<seg id="23">only when her mother became ill at the end of her life, we started to talk: "I love you, I love you, I love you.</seg>
<seg id="24">the birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love with which he lacked as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">you can stop it, "I love you"?</seg>
<seg id="26">just don 't hug me!</seg>
<seg id="27">dad, I 'm 22!</seg>
<seg id="28">with Dawn French.</seg>
<seg id="29">why would I not be friends with her?</seg>
<seg id="30">she 's a great mother</seg>
<seg id="31">they are still great friends with the French, to whom he was married for 25 years.</seg>

<seg id="36">he was the one that killed her.</seg>
<seg id="37">so, when I was very, very recovered and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take drastic measures.</seg>
<seg id="38">then I began serious training фитенсом, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">it is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="40">and it 's boring.</seg>
<seg id="41">nobody eats carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">a change of career trajectories of Henry reflected, perhaps, in his noble, briefly подстриженной beard.</seg>
<seg id="43">since he received the recognition for his critics, Othello, he completely immersed in theatre.</seg>
<seg id="44">"mistakes" Комедия followed, and then "hotel" Огаста Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">this work is different from sitcoms and comedies that were неотъемлимым attribute his busy professional life.</seg>
<seg id="46">he started his career, when he was 16 and worked in a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">DJ noticed how he parodies on the stage, and wrote about it in "new faces."</seg>
<seg id="48">his career in television began in the mid seventies: "quite a long time I was the only black пародистом / first on television."</seg>
<seg id="49">he studied at work.</seg>
<seg id="50">I not only had to grow in the eyes of the public, I had to learn how to be an effective vehicle for delivering jokes between 1975 and 1985, as a star, working on TV, and it was very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny in "New faces" in 1975</seg>
<seg id="52">as his manager had the right to "Black and white minstrels" show, light entertainment program, in which people "чернили themselves face," Henry found that acting in it for five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">my family is a very disliked.</seg>
<seg id="54">I was, like, I want to do this has never happened to me, but I don 't regret doing it.</seg>
<seg id="55">though it was a strange, worthy of condemnation, I worked for large venues and work with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="56">but what was called "the light entertainment on British television classics for years and years," and "it was grotesque to black people."</seg>

<seg id="73">and it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">it seemed that they had been waiting for disaster, but it has not happened.</seg>
<seg id="75">soon we began "Комедию mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="76">suddenly I was at the National Theatre, and I just couldn 't believe it until the end.</seg>
<seg id="77">there was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you have changed."</seg>
<seg id="78">a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his job is to entertain the public.</seg>

<seg id="11">in defence, trickling pipes sat motionless, spiders слизни left their footprints on all the windows, confident that the house belongs to them; garden зарос weeds like giant кочаны cabbage.</seg>

<seg id="13">opinion of the author: Howard Джейкобсон, whose novel "J" included in лонг-лист Букеровской Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">the shortlist will be announced next week</seg>
<seg id="15">Кеверн and Эйлинн sat, holding hands, broken sun loungers in the high grass, enjoying surprisingly warm spring day; they both absentmindedly to cheap consoles, which provided with country music and appeasing 3-zmianowy news, when, glancing at her brown crossed his legs, and he remembered the old song long forgotten black performer, which he loved to listen to his father, the curtains in the house.</seg>

<seg id="40">but at least he did not have to speak Эйлинн that Фэтс Уоллер was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">given her age, it is unlikely she remembered a time when popular singers were not black.</seg>
<seg id="42">again, there are no laws or pressure.</seg>
<seg id="43">society was docile, and this meant that every segment of the agreed with gratitude - the gratitude of those spared the fate, "with the principle of group predispositions.</seg>

<seg id="49">as she had heard only ballads, Эйлинн was difficult to understand how offensive the word, who had just sung her Кеверн, could be laid on music.</seg>
<seg id="50">music is an expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">"they are not really offensive," said Кеверн.</seg>

<seg id="80">attempts by the joke often made him awkward situation, because, like his father, he was missing the soothing charm that could mitigate the cruelty of крывшуюся, in whole or in part.</seg>
<seg id="81">maybe his father wanted to be cruel.</seg>
<seg id="82">maybe he, like Кеверн.</seg>
<seg id="83">despite the good eye.</seg>
<seg id="84">Эйлинн Соломонз flushed and stood up with the lounger, the oldies and the wine that they drank.</seg>

<seg id="107">again one Эйлинн Соломонз looked at their feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">for twenty years prior to the above events or so Esme cantered Нуссбаум, intelligent and energetic 32-летняя исследовательница who worked in "Офнау", an informal service control over Community mood, has prepared a report on the low and medium levels of violence in most parts of the country, where it was expected that it will be reduced, if not over entirely, given the means and the forces that were allocated to its eradication.</seg>
<seg id="109">"a lot has been done, and a lot is being done," she wrote, "in order to mitigate the innate aggressiveness of people who fought in a war and won most of them, especially among these спутанных branches and narrow расселин area, where, despite the saw изгородями spires of churches, gentle breath of human kindness was rarely in history.</seg>
<seg id="110">however, some quality, it turns out, неискоренимы.</seg>
<seg id="111">the higher the spire, it would seem, the низменнее those passions that he зарождает.</seg>
<seg id="112">the population of sheds tears over the sentimental stories about drinking, skipping преодоленных obstacles and announces its overheated faith in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness retains its strong grip as in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is evidence that a new depth and vile задиристость in homes, in the workplace, on roads and even in playgrounds.</seg>
<seg id="113">"you have досадная habit of writing too much," said her supervisor, read the report as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="114">it seems to me that you should read shorter novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">Esme cantered Нуссбаум lowered his head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask you: you атеистка?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I think that is not obliged to answer," said Esme cantered Нуссбаум.</seg>
<seg id="118">are you gay?</seg>
<seg id="119">Esme cantered again insisted on his right to privacy and silence.</seg>
<seg id="120">feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">again, silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I ask," said Luther Рабиновиц, "not because I am against atheism, лесбийства or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">here we have no prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="124">we are the servants of society without prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="125">but some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely reasonable and a good in themselves, they may sometimes distort the results, such as those that you have shown me.</seg>
<seg id="126">it is obvious that you yourself предубеждены against the church, and what you call "malevolent" and "rude", others would be interpreted as an expression of natural and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="127">to continue the нудеть BUT THAT happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened, as if it happened, if it happened yesterday, it means depriving the country needed her life force.</seg>
<seg id="128">Esme cantered Нуссбаум огляделась on both sides until Рабиновиц said.</seg>
<seg id="129">over his head, and pink as gimmicks, LED letters repeated advice that "Офнау" gave the country the last quarter of a century or more.</seg>
<seg id="130">his neighbour, улыбайся value of his spouse, listen to ballads, walk, talk on the phone, organise, talk, listen, объясняй соглашайся, извиняйся.</seg>
<seg id="131">the conversation is better than silence, word of the song better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I fully understand that you want to say," quietly replied Esme cantered Нуссбаум, when satisfied that her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I don 't want to say anything, except that we 're not излечились as efficiently as we convince ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">I worry that if we don 't we are prepared, we find that repeat mistakes, which initially led to ТОМУ ВООБЩЕ IF THAT happened, happened.</seg>
<seg id="134">only this time we выбросим their anger and distrust the other.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Рабиновиц joined the tips of fingers in the sitting.</seg>
<seg id="136">this gesture was supposed to mean an infinite patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"you go too far," he said, "calling" mistakes "actions that made or not made our grandfathers.</seg>
<seg id="138">you go too far and when talking about the fact that they threw away their "anger" and "mistrust" in the "other."</seg>
<seg id="139">in your place, people should not need since then about the fact that, in the past, the present, we are not talking about "us" and "them."</seg>
<seg id="140">there was no "us" and no "other."</seg>
<seg id="141">it was the time of the disorder - and that 's all that we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"for which, to be honest with ourselves," ventured into Esme cantered, "neither part of society may well justify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am not accusing anyone.</seg>
<seg id="144">whether it 's bad or good, what is done is done.</seg>
<seg id="145">then it was back then.</seg>
<seg id="146">nothing to say - here we agree.</seg>
<seg id="147">and how not to blame anybody, we should not make excuses and, if that was appropriate, or if it was something to fix.</seg>
<seg id="148">but why, if not to learn "</seg>
<seg id="149">past Update to ensure that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="150">if I can add to that one word -</seg>

<seg id="2">growth in the eurozone slowed to the lowest in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.</seg>
<seg id="3">the business index (PMI) for the eurozone manufacturing sector public fell to 50.7 in August, dropping from 51.8 in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">the value of above 50 indicates growth.</seg>

<seg id="7">markets will wait for the bank from a clear plan of how to deal with the eurozone ’ s recovery, as well as the threat of deflation, with inflation of just 0.3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="8">there is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi announced later this week, may give further signals that he is contemplating scheme of quantitative easing in the eurozone, similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although some growth is better than no growth, braking effect of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers becomes more obvious," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at public.</seg>
<seg id="10">the manufacturing sector PMI in Germany, a major trade partner of Russia in the EU, has fallen to the lowest in 11 months of 51.4.</seg>
<seg id="11">meanwhile, the second largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.</seg>

<seg id="16">Howard Арчер, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "the best that can be said about the August survey index of business activity in the eurozone manufacturing sector is that it shows that the sector is still growing."</seg>
<seg id="17">he added: "eurozone manufacturers, obviously, are finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension - particularly associated with the Russia / Ukraine - adds to the uncertainty still difficult conditions in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">this increased tensions, apparently hit by business - and especially on the confidence of consumers, and is likely to lead to the fact that some orders are delayed, or even cancelled, especially large orders.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips, how to achieve a better quality of underwater photos and video</seg>
<seg id="2">if you want to take pictures or shoot video under water, you have a number of options.</seg>
<seg id="3">the cheapest option is waterproof "Point and Shoot," for example, the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or, for example, GoPro Hero3 экшн-камера + Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I took these pictures on a family holiday with the help of a few cameras, all for the price of about $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">no matter what equipment you are using, you need to comply with several regulations, in order to achieve the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">перепроверяйте their equipment.</seg>
<seg id="7">even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera case and other branches of the tightly closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">in addition, set up their camera for the type of photos or videos that you shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">some of the photos and video cameras filming or object type is regimes that optimise exposure for mages underwater conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">and before you jump in the water, look at how deep your equipment can fall.</seg>
<seg id="11">some cameras are aimed only at 5 feet, others - 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">look at our leadership and the ratings of digital cameras for both traditional and November models.</seg>
<seg id="13">remove a few frames - because many of them don 't enclosures.</seg>
<seg id="14">"essentially" is the LCD, which lets you assign images, whereas the экшн-камер them usually don 't.</seg>
<seg id="15">even if you have LCD, it will be difficult to see under the water, and the layout is a random process.</seg>
<seg id="16">so do a few frames.</seg>
<seg id="17">also, if you have your camera 's serial shooting mode, which takes several shots with slightly different plant, use them.</seg>
<seg id="18">stay at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">the amount of light is significantly reduced, the deeper you нырнете under water.</seg>
<seg id="20">if possible, stay at the surface, when you 're shooting in the pool, the river or the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">it also allows you to transmit more colors in the photos; the deeper you get, the less you see color.</seg>
<seg id="22">подплывайте closer to objects.</seg>
<seg id="23">this is excellent advice for shooting on the land, but it is even more important under the water because of the mages light conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">it is especially important if you 're shooting on экшн-камеру: this equipment often comes with a fixed, широкоугольной lens, which means that you have to get close to it, if you want to fill the frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was such a man, whose force of personality could shake things around, even in such a giant organization like the National Health Service.</seg>
<seg id="2">консультирующий anaesthetist, he has devoted his career needs of patients suffering from the disease and the treatment of tattooing.</seg>
<seg id="3">among those who spoke to him, recalls his wife, MI-6 officer who had to live with devastating effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that as long as Dr. passionate about being diagnosed and diseases, those who are being treated, mainly worried about something else -- the pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">one day in 2007, however, he appeared to those who suffer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I never felt, as usual," he wrote in May last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I found it hard to find strength in herself.</seg>
<seg id="8">struggling with symptoms similar to flu, he found that his wife, Джулиет reproaches irritably.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want all happened sooner rather than later," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">when Джулиет left for a week, Lawson found that unusual and it is unclear why he was upset.</seg>
<seg id="11">something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="12">he asked a colleague to chest X-rays.</seg>
<seg id="13">just two weeks before he went skiing in the Alps Французских.</seg>
<seg id="14">the results of the X-rays came.</seg>
<seg id="15">it was mesothelioma, a terminal cancer, which affects плевру shell, or lungs.</seg>
<seg id="16">for most cancers it is difficult to determine the exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">although some people succumb to cancer of the lung, for example, not all cancer patients smoking lung.</seg>
<seg id="18">but with mesothelioma differently.</seg>
<seg id="19">in almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, grainy construction material, who once called a "miracle," but which, as we now know, deadly dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">for most of us, the disease is mesothelioma which could not pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="21">asbestos, at the end of the day, "the material from the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">the most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in the UK since the 1960s, when these industrial ban came into force.</seg>
<seg id="23">even when it has been used, only people from specific sectors worked in close contact with him: трубоизолировщики, builders, carpenters and computers, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">industrial toxin from another era, he hardly seems cause for concern today.</seg>
<seg id="25">but such a calm erroneously.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it turns out, is now at the peak of the epidemic мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="27">here from мезотелиомы dies more people than in any other country on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="28">in the annual mortality rate in about 2500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease than as a result of road accidents.</seg>
<seg id="29">the annual number of deaths from мезотелиомы since 1980 and projected the number of deaths in the UK in the future</seg>
<seg id="30">the reason we feel its deadly consequences right now, lies in the fact that, although the use of asbestos and it is illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), for the development of мезотелиомы go usually tens of years.</seg>
<seg id="31">and the problem is not limited to veterans мезотелиомы specialties.</seg>
<seg id="32">asbestos was, and is, in many cases, remains in the house where we live, where we work, offices, schools, shops, where we are and where we go shopping.</seg>
<seg id="33">as a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention in class, profession, income level or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">bastions of избранности, from fashion London department stores to private schools, as it turned out, not salvation.</seg>
<seg id="35">the parliament building is riddled with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="36">even hospitals that are meant to cure us of deadly reservoirs have proved to be a carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">he was not трубоизолировщиком.</seg>
<seg id="39">in fact, he had to think where he might have come into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">then he realized.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it seems that it could be a lot of asbestos in tunnels in the hospital Guy, where I spent six years on it," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">all are students, nurses, doctors and грузчики - used these тоннелями.</seg>
<seg id="43">I wonder how many of my peers expect the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">it was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial response.</seg>
<seg id="45">"of the four doctors, which we in the hospital and Guy have subsequently developed mesothelioma for the past five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I alone remained alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">how many of us expect this disease?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Лоусону was diagnosed with "mesothelioma," when he was 48 years old.</seg>
<seg id="48">when he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">live so long is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="50">fifty percent of patients die from mesothelioma eight months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">it is always fatal.</seg>
<seg id="52">so, now, we can only repeat Lawson 's question: "how many of us expect this disease?"</seg>
<seg id="53">according to a leading expert in the UK, Kolya, Professor Джулиану Пито, most likely to assume that the years between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain should be a bootmaker, by a man about to die.</seg>
<seg id="54">most now are not that die that way.</seg>
<seg id="55">asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada, with</seg>
<seg id="56">a quick review of reports from the halls of the court, where victims are often seek compensation, shows how far it has spread attack мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="57">in this June, for example, Marks & Spencer acknowledged that have included Ellen Джэнис contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">she worked for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, apparel departments at two sites, one of which was the store on Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs Ellen was just 18 years old, when she started working at M & S.</seg>
<seg id="60">now her two children more than 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="61">"before this happened," she says, "I have never heard of Kolya, I barely knew about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="62">and in my head I could not come, that it will affect me.</seg>
<seg id="63">few people really know a lot about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="64">in fact, asbestos is not one substance, and a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">they get their name from the word "асбестиформ", which means the fibrous structure, which tells them the strength and flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="66">of those six, three were often used in construction.</seg>
<seg id="67">chrysotile, widely known as white asbestos, much more often than other occurs in buildings today.</seg>
<seg id="68">it has been used in roofing panels, used his thermal insulation pipes, boiler, toilets, even the brake колодках cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">he 's less смертелен than other forms of asbestos, but still recognised by the European Union and the World Health Organization, "a source of serious health damage," which can lead to death.</seg>
<seg id="70">more dangerous, however, brown asbestos (амозит) and blue asbestos (крокидолит).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world 's largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that there are good, though indirect reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with mesothelioma [in the UK]. "</seg>
<seg id="72">an employee of the Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the main store on London 's Oxford Street, with</seg>
<seg id="73">Джэнис Ellen may not have thought of yourself as a victim, but Julian Пито мезотелиомы work suggests that her story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">he conducted a study on patients, which suggests that a significant percentage of мезотелиом when there is no known exposure at work or at home, were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment. "</seg>
<seg id="75">much of this impact, he says, is "a normal use and exposure to weather" in our buildings.</seg>
<seg id="76">no one, it seems, can 't be sure that he is safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">Goddard Consulting report, which was in the palace of Westminster, demonstrates how people, even in the heart of the government, could be exposed to unconsciously.</seg>
<seg id="78">in 2009, Goddard said that technical mines and pipelines for the premises of parliamentary committees were infected with deadly asbestos fibers, which could follow in the movement, something so harmless as "strong currents of air."</seg>
<seg id="79">members of the parliament often blame the fact that they are pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.</seg>
<seg id="80">although the dish on the maintenance of Parliament insisted that Westminster Palace received a "clean bill of health now," she acknowledged, however, that it is necessary to work on the £1 billion for the reconstruction of the Parliament, by upgrading electrician and removing asbestos, and that after the general election in 2015, possibly members of parliament, will meet in the conference centre nearby disproportionately, not on the green benches horizon.</seg>
<seg id="81">Goddard report noted that "the situation with the asbestos was ruled not in accordance with the various rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">it is impossible to know whether this error management cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">all that you can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">one of those who could not identify their contact with asbestos, Graham is the cost, the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="85">as Andrew Lawson, cost, 50 years, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I worked in a hospital, which were successfully brought claims associated with asbestos," he says, "But I can 't prove this in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">so it 's hard to remember all the places where he worked, and the date.</seg>
<seg id="88">he remembers clearly, so this day in early December 2009, when his wholly overcame something that was like the flu.</seg>
<seg id="89">he was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">suddenly were shaken as me.</seg>
<seg id="91">it started very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terrible.</seg>
<seg id="93">I thought that I could go all the way to homes.</seg>
<seg id="94">cost of being a doctor, knew that pain comes from, including checking for iframe loads a shell around the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="95">however, like Джэнис Ellen, he had no reason to suspect мезотелиому.</seg>
<seg id="96">in the end, he could not walk to work a month.</seg>
<seg id="97">US doctors doing chest x-rays and плевральные катетеры to pull fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis.</seg>
<seg id="98">and yet his condition оставлось without the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">gradually, his health has improved, and he returned to work.</seg>
<seg id="100">but from time to time the same symptoms return, often after he engaged in sports, and he breathed heavily.</seg>
<seg id="101">in 2011, one of the patients came to him in the Dubai office with similar symptoms, and he was later diagnosed with mesothelioma. ""</seg>
<seg id="102">but even then the cost is not associated with their own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">in the end, his patient was on dozens of years older and worked with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">in this case, the link was obvious.</seg>
<seg id="105">in September 2011, the state of Dubai, Kazakhstan has worsened again and his doctor showed him the results of the CT and X-ray images of the group of experts.</seg>
<seg id="106">in December 2011, exactly two years after the cost began to feel ill, sensor, equipped with a camera, was introduced into his chest cavity between the shell, and the shell of his lung.</seg>
<seg id="107">I 'm an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I usually just go further, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="109">I 'm not too upset about it, to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="110">but Rachel, my wife was.</seg>
<seg id="111">biopsy results came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that it was mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham: cost of mesothelioma diagnosis</seg>
<seg id="113">suddenly cost sank during a meeting with Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested he contact a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">it was then he realised the scale of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"it turns out that asbestos was commonly used, especially in large public buildings, and where quite often there was asbestos thermal insulation systems on the planet," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">people who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, now succumb to the disease.</seg>
<seg id="117">thus, mesothelioma now affects more young people, atypical professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">the most dangerous isolated asbestos pipes in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">but many employees, who were on the pedestrian tunnels connecting nearby landmasses can bring together to get from one building to another (as Andrew Lawson), or eat in the basement canteens (how often did Graham cost) almost certainly really were exposed to toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">for several decades after the war, as it turns out, the hospital was a place where, in theory, pulled the life for поциентов, but a place that constituted a threat to life for doctors who treated them.</seg>
<seg id="121">it still continues to remove today.</seg>
<seg id="122">students set their burners Бунзена on 3rd Son</seg>
<seg id="123">and it 's not just hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and мэриях due to their amazing and insulating characteristics input.</seg>
<seg id="125">schools too.</seg>
<seg id="126">in fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the classroom for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="127">across the country, countless chemistry lessons, students set their burners Бунзена 3rd on tap.</seg>
<seg id="128">websites have appeared, highlighting the problem of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as floor tiles or roof сараев typically contained asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"this is an industrial poison, in a huge number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson 's case against the hospital in Guy.</seg>
<seg id="131">in one case, the only contact, the woman could remember was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">so be careful, снося garden sheds.</seg>
<seg id="133">the effect of the diagnosis, when we know that the disease is incurable, is huge.</seg>
<seg id="134">"to realize it, is quite a lot of time," says Graham cost.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn 't focus on what I 'm doing.</seg>
<seg id="136">I spent two weeks in surgery.</seg>
<seg id="137">then I realized that I had to go and deal with them.</seg>
<seg id="138">well, I don 't meet Christmas</seg>
<seg id="139">one of the most difficult things was the transition from doctor to patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">as countless patients before him, he remembers, was downed with the amount of information that had to be taken.</seg>
<seg id="141">"it was difficult to understand," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked his doctor" how many I have time? "</seg>
<seg id="143">gave me about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember, as I thought, "Well, I 'm not much of a Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">that 's all. "</seg>
<seg id="146">mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, as it is the mechanics of how we are in life, "the very act of breathing, raises cancer, which kills.</seg>
<seg id="147">most cases are caused by мезотелиомы contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="148">asbestos is composed of tiny fibers.</seg>
<seg id="149">when asbestos is being destroyed and the carcinogenic fibers, they can get stuck in the lungs, плевре shell.</seg>
<seg id="150">asbestos fibers are annoying плевру and can cause mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the problem is due to the inhalation of asbestos fibres needle," Professor Tom Трежер, кардиоторакальный surgeon, who came to the hospital in 2001, Guy.</seg>
<seg id="152">it is the same hospital where the suspect, Andrew Lawson, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="153">Трежер knew Lawson 's and treated some of the others who, perhaps, was exposed to while in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">when иголочки asbestos into the lung tissue, "says Трежер, breathing them unload on the periphery, where the shell.</seg>
<seg id="155">this is, essentially, think the process from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="156">conventional treatments of other forms of cancer is much less effective in Kolya.</seg>
<seg id="157">the effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, cause hot debate.</seg>
<seg id="158">some think it 's worth a try.</seg>
<seg id="159">Трежер disagrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">"you can 't cut плевру," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">no good around her with a knife.</seg>
<seg id="162">meanwhile, the cancer is "not very well to chemotherapy," which "acts", but not people.</seg>
<seg id="163">"from time to time there are patients who live for a long time," says Трежер.</seg>
<seg id="164">but ultimately, they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">fortunately, some patients are living much, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after he was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="167">two and a half years after diagnosis, Graham cost continues to fight.</seg>
<seg id="168">after he became ill from mesothelioma, Andrew Лоусоном on Dubai, which, four years after the diagnosis, single-handedly turned into office support and advice for patients.</seg>
<seg id="169">"yes, Раковая Central," he said, cheerfully when they called.</seg>
<seg id="170">"he was very positive," says cost.</seg>
<seg id="171">he was diagnosed with four years ago, and he still is very energetic.</seg>
<seg id="172">first Эбботту offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and would have prolonged his life only a month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was in despair," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, managed to somewhat more positive agenda. "</seg>
<seg id="176">meeting with several specialists, decided to continue the treatment cost with Professor Лоиком Ланж-Лаздунски торакальной, professor of surgery at Guy Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we had an advantage in that I don 't need it, I just called them and they took me," admits Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">the consultants would have to get the direction and approval for funding.</seg>
<seg id="179">money plays a decisive role for patients with mesothelioma, to get the best available treatments.</seg>
<seg id="180">but when such treatments become ineffective, finally, inevitably, many patients are facing another financial reason for concern "about the future of the families that they would leave.</seg>
<seg id="181">and then they ask the courts for compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan, of Field Fisher Price Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"it has been known that asbestos is harmful to health, in 1898," said Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">but that changed in the 1960s, is that it became clear that even very small amounts can put their health at risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">it was then spoke about the bad faith.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson, and Guy 's Hospital, ultimately, resolve the matter, but this was not "the full cost of the settlement," according to Morgan, as Lawson could not clearly prove that his mesothelioma was the result of exposure to asbestos at Guy Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="187">after the investigation into his death, hospital spokesman Guy is confirmed, however, that "asbestos in its basement, mentioned above, was removed in the 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="188">it was too late for Andrew Lawson 's.</seg>
<seg id="189">how to remove asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">in fact, some contact with deadly asbestos to one company or place of work - usually through dozens of years after that - it turned out to be a big problem for patients with mesothelioma, demanding compensation.</seg>
<seg id="191">many of their former employers have changed owner or shut down.</seg>
<seg id="192">insurance archives could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">and those who are protected from lawsuits, knows that time is on their side, plaintiffs have, of course, no.</seg>
<seg id="194">in response, this year took serious new legislative acts which facilitate patients with mesothelioma compensation recovery process, even if it is impossible to keep track of their former employers.</seg>
<seg id="195">in accordance with the law, was created by £350-миллионный fund of funds, which is financed by the insurance industry, for those who were diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove the contact, but not anyone with whom to sue.</seg>
<seg id="196">in such cases, patients will receive 80 percent of the amount that the court could award in a case about the compensation of about £pirates.</seg>
<seg id="197">about 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected to each year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with mesothelioma, believes that the £350 million represent a "very good job" for the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"this transaction, which insured for insurers," he says, hinting that the sum is a quarter of that insurers would have to pay, if not intervened time and patients with mesothelioma would be able to trace the company and file a lawsuit in the usual way.</seg>
<seg id="200">even Mike Пеннинг, previously minister for work and pensions, acknowledged that the law "imperfect."</seg>
<seg id="201">but Пеннинг, and Morgan acknowledged that, in view of the fact that seven people die every day, rapid action was needed.</seg>
<seg id="202">"people suffer so much, and they need help now," said Пеннинг during the second reading of the Bill Kolya in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">by the time Graham cost was in the hands of Professor Лоика Ланж-Лаздунски 19 months.</seg>
<seg id="204">after the initial consultation Ланж-Лаздунски recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Трежера, he believes to be effective.</seg>
<seg id="205">this was followed by radiation and chemotherapy -- тритерапия Ланж-Лаздунски can boast, in which the entire 40 percent of patients surviving for five years.</seg>
<seg id="206">cost of felt a surge of strength.</seg>
<seg id="207">"this is, of course, one of the most important things," says cost.</seg>
<seg id="208">you see these patients all the time.</seg>
<seg id="209">there is a force that supports you.</seg>
<seg id="210">when сдаешься, condition can deteriorate very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham went to the cost of the operation in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">by the end of August he finished last of six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">subsequent scans showed no trace of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">then I did a scan in March [2014].</seg>
<seg id="215">there were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I just happen to have 50.</seg>
<seg id="217">this is not a threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="218">this is the end of life.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose their leaders; protesters promise revenge</seg>
<seg id="2">China 's parliament decided Sunday to not allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reforms.</seg>
<seg id="3">such a move would likely mark the beginning of long promised protests in Hong Kong as activists have begun planning and mobilization in a matter of hours after that statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">the decision of the 11th National People 's Congress, in fact, communist leaders to remove all the candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it 's not обмануло our expectations, but still leads in rage," said lawmaker Emily Лау, chairman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">this is not something that Beijing has promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">they lied to the people of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">and it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">defending the decision of China, Li Fey, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the 11th National People 's Congress, said that to allow public nominations for the election of Hong Kong would be too "erratic behavior."</seg>
<seg id="10">since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing promised to allow residents to vote by the head of the government, starting in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">on Sunday, Chinese leaders have taken the decision as a democratic step forward, since it gives a direct vote гонконгцам right; however, the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process in his hands with the help of the Commission on the Nomination, rigidly controlled from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">and, according to a new article that only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be admitted.</seg>
<seg id="13">the decision was taken after the summer, when there have been some of the most large-scale and received widespread publicity the protests in Hong Kong for many years.</seg>
<seg id="14">for a large part of the campaign after Occupy Central movement in Hong Kong is With Love and Peace, which threatened to cut off the financial district in Hong Kong if Beijing does not guarantee real universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">on Sunday evening, a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central gathered in the rain to Hong Kong government headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="16">the organisers of the demonstration said that their movement is shifting to a new phase of civil disobedience and that they rise up on the waves of protest in the next few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">nevertheless, they have not reported the details, obviously, to avoid problems with government bodies.</seg>
<seg id="18">in онлайн-заявлении organizers reported that "the ability to capture the central region обдумывало only as exceptional measures, steps that can be taken only if all the possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">we regret to inform you that today, all possibilities have been exhausted and the seizure of the dialogue will be held.</seg>
<seg id="20">authorities in Hong Kong were preparing to Beijing a few days, and on Sunday at the headquarters of the government had strengthened security measures involving police and barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">the unrest is the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their own city.</seg>
<seg id="22">the influx of residents from mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">also increases fear that Hong Kong 's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">some have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying that his demonstration to jeopardize the business is the source of life force in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the protest, which they say, it can lead to great economic damage, depending on how many people will participate, and how long," said lawmaker Regina Yip, who has long been critical of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="26">we do not want to spread concern about the fact that Hong Kong can spin out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">this idea, which is harmful for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chinese state media also gave reports in recent days, in which Hong Kong activists of the democratic movement, were shown диверсантами направляемыми Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">this summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral law, which drew tripped over one fifth of Hong Kong voters.</seg>
<seg id="30">and in July, tens of thousands came out to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">feminists brought up the issue of race and the behaviour of the police after Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Фергюсоне, Missouri, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">coming raise their hands, chanting: "hands up, don 't ice" while they wait in line in front of the burial.</seg>
<seg id="4">after two weeks of protests in Missouri, Фергюсоне, associated with the murder of teenager Michael Brown, blogger безоружного Miriam зоила Perez noticed a shift in интернет-разговоре among white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">in her experience, the white feminists, leave comments put gender above race, when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">however, as the tension increased in the Midwest and attracted national attention, Peres saw the white women who is 100 percent focused on the race.</seg>
<seg id="7">compared with the reaction of black women shortly after the killing on 9 August, personal essays with such titles as "thoughts about Фергюсоне from white women" and "Феминизм is not only about the example of women" came relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">but for Perez, they demonstrated a significant shift.</seg>
<seg id="9">"in feminism, I don 't think there are many people who are talking about the white color of the skin and privileges at such a high level," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">people feel the need to say something about what has happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">this is a very symbolic for the crisis with which we are faced, and because (the situation in Фергюсоне) is so tied to the race, they felt that it should be set.</seg>
<seg id="12">for Professor of English at the University of Ohio Кориты Mitchell Ferguson has laid bare problems that blacks face every day, but one which is not perceived as a "women 's problems" in the cultural sphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can write something funny on Facebook about what was going on with me and my partner and get 150 лайков from everywhere," says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">when I write something about how colored people are attacked in his own country, clearly the silence.</seg>
<seg id="15">"why do women safely publicly talk about relationships, but not about the security in the public sector?" she asks.</seg>
<seg id="16">for black women, like Mitchell, who studied the issues of race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between matters relating to race and gender.</seg>
<seg id="17">from her point of view, blacks, women are in a position to clearly separate the problems; they are faced with a complex reality every day.</seg>
<seg id="18">while white women now bring together issues of race and gender in feminist мейнстриме, Энджела Хэттери, a professor of women 's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that its predecessor did.</seg>
<seg id="19">"between 1865 and 1890 years линчевали at least 10,000 black men, and the ground is almost always served as the rape of white women," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="20">there was a white woman, was the story to justify Nepal.</seg>
<seg id="21">from the point of view of Хэттери, the gap between white and black women, white when you have, for example, Susan B. Anthony looked at the situation in the late 1800s, and saw that the fight for suffrage will be effective only for one of the groups: women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"they decided to lay all the eggs in the basket of voting rights for women, and the right to vote for blacks would appear later," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="23">look back on things like this gives us a clear idea of why colored women don 't trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">we have not done anything good.</seg>
<seg id="25">we 've never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to ensure that the white women united against mob lynchings in the Women 's Association for the prevention of mob lynchings of the South.</seg>

<seg id="1">the Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the market for electric cars</seg>
<seg id="2">this week the Ministry of Economic Development will make the government a comprehensive plan for the development of clean vehicles in Russia, told the deputy director of the ministry, Oleg Плужников round table that held the Vedomosti at the Moscow show - 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">the plan drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals is to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</seg>
<seg id="4">it is expected that the document will be passed in late September and early October, says Плужников, the proposed measures concerning the development of electric cars and hybrids - vehicles on газомоторном fuel in Russia already have.</seg>
<seg id="5">(a copy of the plan have said) is designed for 2014-2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">to develop the criteria for the assessment of electricity and hybrid vehicles and decide how to promote the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">the government report, which will be described in the tax and customs measures quality support, will be prepared by December 2014; a concessional lending and leasing will grace by April 2015, and the proposal to reduce prices, and encourage the creation of service the infrastructure will be developed by October 2015</seg>
<seg id="8">in 2014-2015, is expected to make changes to regulations to ease conditions for the construction of the infrastructure charge (parking, petrol stations etc.).</seg>
<seg id="9">in addition, federal officials plan for 2015 to formulate proposals for regional authorities, as well as to promote the use of clean transport - in the form of providing him with the movement and parking, for example; and by February 2016 and the expansion of government purchases of such transport.</seg>
<seg id="10">finally, the Ministry of Economic Development by October 2014 will depend on the evaluation of the performance of the regional authorities of criteria that reflect the effectiveness of the support for the production of clean transport, the development of the infrastructure charge.</seg>
<seg id="11">U.S. market in Russia, while only formed in 2013 across the country sold around 100 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="12">at the beginning of the 2014 обнулена import duty on electric cars, so sales will be approximately 500 pieces, predicts Chief Executive Director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="13">but пятикратный growth does not make any noticeable: electric cars in Russia in 2013, according to the Association of European Businesses, sold 2,78 million cars and light commercial vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="14">while Sunderland in Russia imports only Mitsubishi Motors.</seg>
<seg id="15">start import preparing Renault - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says director for strategic planning and partnerships in Russia Renault Nicolas Ремиз.</seg>
<seg id="16">most of the other manufacturers of electric vehicles took in relation to Russia is taking a wait-and-see approach.</seg>
<seg id="17">the development of electric cars and Russian manufacturers GAZ CEO, "", "," but the trivial.</seg>
<seg id="18">for example, in January - July 2014, according to the "АСМ-холдинга," Avtovaz released 30 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="19">due to the modest demand for U.S. products, "admits director of AvtoVAZ engineering Sergei Аманов, without state support the breakthrough in this segment will not.</seg>
<seg id="20">the development of the Russian market in addition to the new electric cars (those electric cars that are sold in Russia, on average, twice as expensive counterparts with internal combustion engines) is an underdeveloped infrastructure charge (Economics - units), "sighs CEO Sergei Автостата Целиков.</seg>
<seg id="21">because of the soaring prices and low rates of decline in the cost of electric cars in the next 3-4 years remain нишевым segment of the Russian market, "predicts editor-in-chief Mikhail Авторевю Подорожанский Целиков, agrees with him.</seg>
<seg id="22">manufacturers, by contrast, say that some models of electric cars is already close to the value of the ordinary.</seg>
<seg id="23">the Russian market, U.S. prospects, the important thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "real" электромобильность; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of the new charging stations, president of BMW 's Wolfgang Шлимме.</seg>
<seg id="24">such infrastructure projects, for example, is the "Россети": in Moscow several stations, will soon have about 80.</seg>
<seg id="25">talks on the construction of a network of Economics and negotiations with other regions.</seg>
<seg id="26">according to Director of "Россетей" Vladimir Софьина, the company believes the market is ready to build electric and gas stations across the country, but there are problems: a small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging different brands.</seg>
<seg id="27">in addition, "Россети" as network the company does not have the right to engage in the sale of electricity, being able to do this in relation to charging.</seg>
<seg id="28">his wife believes the most effective measure in support of Russia 's single market progeSOFT customs duties.</seg>
<seg id="29">zero rate will act before the end of 2014, its renewal and expansion of the preferential list.</seg>
<seg id="30">the transportation tax to environmental (the idea is being discussed and concerns all machines), too, will support the market, but not as noticeably as customs preferences, his wife said.</seg>
<seg id="31">transport tax in Russia is relatively small, "says Pankov, unlike, for example, from Norway, where the reduced tax rate led to a sharp increase in electric sales - now they account for 12% of the market.</seg>
<seg id="32">in Russia, and the need for stimulus measures, such as free parking in the centre of town (as it has done in Moscow), I am sure Pankov, or any movement of dedicated lanes for electric cars, which are not yet in Russia.</seg>

<seg id="22">worrying times for the currency market, let me remind you, when at the end of January was increased demand for the currency, as well as a third of March, when the Central Bank отгрузил a record number of currency.</seg>

<seg id="24">first of all, this increase in the revenue part of the budget from the export operations, as well as improving the competitiveness of domestic manufacturers at the expense of the expensive imports, says chief analyst UFS IC Alexei Kozlov.</seg>
<seg id="25">negative moments can be attributed to the cost of imported goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="26">sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of the investment in the Russian economy, encourage the growth of global inflationary pressures and, as a result, become expensive for borrowing funds which, in turn, slows down the development of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="27">if we talk about the stock market, the rouble devaluation smoothes over a fall in share prices, expressed in roubles.</seg>
<seg id="28">for example, the MICEX index during trading Thursday fell 1.67 per cent, while the RTS Index lost 3.27 percent.</seg>
<seg id="29">such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of reduction of indices due to the weakening of the ruble during the day more than 1.5%.</seg>
<seg id="30">the weakening of the ruble is an emotional character and can be explained by a massive desire to buy the currency.</seg>
<seg id="31">in practice, gradually emotions go to, and quotes the ruble partially or fully restore lost ground.</seg>
<seg id="32">"we believe, soon we will be able to see the value of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles to the dollar," said Alexei Kozlov.</seg>

<seg id="5">in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion in the coffers of the state and local level in fiscal 2013, to 3.8 percent more than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">the tax burden on business in the state and local level in the past year rose by 4.3 per cent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after overtaking each other years when account disparities, in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">taxes, rose 4.3 percent, faster than the local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to the study, which was conducted by professional services firm, Ernst & Young and the Center for taxation by the state tax policy.</seg>
<seg id="8">more than half of the tax revenue in the county, 56 percent, in taxes on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of tax revenue for Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia, with 28 percent, is the lowest amount of tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="10">to a large extent, the growth of tax receipts was caused by a return to the same level of the value of real estate companies, the researchers say, that raised taxes on real estate by 3.7 per cent this year, after three years in a row, when growth was less than 1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">while a large percentage of these books are in large states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same thing is happening in the Washington area.</seg>
<seg id="12">in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion property taxes at the state and local level in the past year, to $9.6 billion more than in 2012, an increase of 4.2 per cent, compared with the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">however, the return of the value of the property does not have a similar effect on the growth of tax revenue for the state and local level in Maryland, where property taxes barely exceed one-fifth of companies 'tax bills.</seg>
<seg id="14">Virginia and the District of Columbia are paying about half the tax bills on the state and local level, in the form of taxes on real estate.</seg>
<seg id="15">"what is happening in Maryland is that such a large part of their real estate, especially tax base around the District of Columbia belongs to either the government or nonprofit organization that does not pay taxes on real estate," said Douglas Линдхолм, executive director of the Center for taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">thus, Maryland is forced to rely more on, for example, income taxes to pay for those services that exist in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">the recent increase in tax receipts from businesses cannot fully explain the recovery of the real estate market.</seg>
<seg id="18">income entrepreneurs also, it seems, are on the mend, according to this data.</seg>
<seg id="19">companies in the region, Chinese corporate income tax at a level of $2.3 billion to $2.1 billion more than in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland has collected $1 billion of corporate income tax, the most in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">although the trends are aimed in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase with the same speed in all three areas.</seg>
<seg id="22">the level of growth in the District of Columbia was on the same level as the average for the country of 4.3 per cent, while growth was significantly faster in Maryland, 4.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">only in Virginia was below the average rise in tax revenues, equal to 4.1 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="24">in Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax from three jurisdictions (each of which have the same corporate rate) equal to 6 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="25">in Maryland, a corporate tax rate of 8.25 percent, whereas in the District is relatively high - 9,975 percent.</seg>

<seg id="27">the county has not been evaluated in this study.</seg>
<seg id="28">despite its advantage, Virginia is facing competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south.</seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina recently signed a legislative act, reduce corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="30">if the state continues to achieve objectives during the next year, this law could bring income tax rate for entrepreneurs, even up to 3 per cent by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="31">meanwhile, a small business in the Washington area, it seems, feels better and, thus, pay more in taxes to the state and local level, according to a recent study.</seg>
<seg id="32">taxes for entrepreneurs, paid in the form of individual income tax, small business owners, a transition structure, which is constructed, most small firms - in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, with much greater speed than taxes for предпринимателй in general.</seg>
<seg id="33">the researchers say that the trend and an increase in revenues from taxes on businesses across the country are likely to persist this year, with the proceeds of the tax on turnover in the governments of the state and local level, from 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year.</seg>

<seg id="2">the fact that the cost of university textbooks for many students more than $1000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move to the second course, came up with an ingenious way to reduce costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">he developed system, how to take a book, offering them a старшекурсников rated compensation that they delayed their sale.</seg>
<seg id="4">"my textbook on mathematical analysis, which usually costs $180, I got on a semester for $10 and biscuits" Chick-fil-A "," says Schroeder, 19, who studies at Ковенант College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">the literature on last semester cost would be $430, he says.</seg>
<seg id="6">he spent $120.</seg>
<seg id="7">according to the Council, the average college student spends $1,200 a year on books and supplies, but the students have a number of options to reduce these costs.</seg>
<seg id="8">students increasingly choose online stores and creative ideas, such as Schroeder system.</seg>
<seg id="9">rent books is becoming more popular, allowing students to use a book during the semester, and often is significantly cheaper than buying them.</seg>
<seg id="10">the company "Нибо Инкорпорейтид", which holds more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of rental books grew by half since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">industry studies show that about a quarter of books in university bookstores during the past spring semester were taken, said the vice president "Нибо" Trevor Meyer.</seg>

<seg id="14">purchase in store</seg>
<seg id="15">sometimes, if you 'll come out in the Internet, the price of a new book could constitute one third of that, what you will see in the university bookstore.</seg>
<seg id="16">the ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" Ron Larson ’ s Bruce Edwards and Robert Хостетлера worth about $290 privately, but a copy can be purchased for $239,99 site Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="17">buying подержанного</seg>
<seg id="18">if you don 't mind other people 's notes or damage, second-hand textbooks are a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"mathematical analysis" sold for $93,49 подержанном form on to Chegg.com.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Кэсэдей, 25 years later, a fourth year student at the University of Бригэм Young, said that paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of the book "strategic decisions in the media: an understanding of the business side of the advertising business."</seg>
<seg id="21">the book sold for $48.</seg>
<seg id="22">teachers, for example, the Ingrid Брейси, director of "without walls" College at the University of Massachusetts in Эмхерсте, offers students refine their professors, if not to previous editions.</seg>
<seg id="23">sometimes the updates are insignificant for classes.</seg>
<seg id="24">in such cases, the old editions can often be found in a very small fraction of the cost of the latest edition.</seg>
<seg id="25">in addition to websites Amazon and Chegg, Half.com, "owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying second-hand books.</seg>

<seg id="28">you can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.</seg>
<seg id="29">for example, a student could rent a "Математический analysis" for a semester for about $20.</seg>
<seg id="30">find out what the store, where you take a book, including any fines that you can write the notes, and damage.</seg>
<seg id="31">if you take a book, remember: if you don 't give the book, fines may even exceed the cost of the new instance.</seg>
<seg id="32">electronic books</seg>
<seg id="33">electronic books instead of traditional textbooks is another option.</seg>
<seg id="34">sometimes, these books take the rent, buying electronic license for a certain period for retailers, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.</seg>
<seg id="35">"rent" on the site Chegg.com Mathematical Analysis for six months will cost about $61.</seg>
<seg id="36">Брейси says that students who study literature, can often find the most advantageous prices, as many of the classics are now free, whereas literature on natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.</seg>
<seg id="37">despite that, осмотритесь.</seg>
<seg id="38">Joe Who, 29, who is going to start their studies in high school, and recommends that use Пеппердин ISBN number to book prices, as this will ensure that you are looking for precisely the right you text.</seg>

<seg id="40">on August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree applying specific economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which is basically food sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="41">the country banned the import of beef, pork, a by-product from meat and poultry, meat, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cheese, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausage and sugar syrups.</seg>
<seg id="42">restaurants have begun jockeying seems with suppliers: food prices have increased, we need urgently to counterparts from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="43">this will affect the most expensive restaurants with монокухней France, Italy, Spain, in which products supplied directly from "motherships" countries.</seg>
<seg id="44">общепиту activities and had earlier.</seg>
<seg id="45">for example, when, at the beginning of 2014, banned the import of Australian beef, and the year before - the American and Canadian meat.</seg>
<seg id="46">in return, the suppliers have supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="47">but sanctions лета-2014 were far more serious.</seg>
<seg id="48">however, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the president 's decree, which lifted the ban on Atlantic salmon and trout fry безлактозное seed potatoes, milk, sugar, corn, peas and onions for replanting.</seg>
<seg id="49">the Italian transfer hopes that sanctions might even смягчиться.</seg>

<seg id="51">according to the company "East-West", one of the world 's largest suppliers of imported products in the premium segment accounted for up to 70%.</seg>

<seg id="53">if a chef, for him it 's not going to be a problem.</seg>

<seg id="56">in restaurants with mixed kitchen are starting to replace dishes, for example steak from marble beef - on бефстроганов, says Sergei Mironov.</seg>
<seg id="57">"cheeses from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian, cheese, cheese from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," lists the "East-West" Oksana Глибчук.</seg>
<seg id="58">cream and milk products from Europe have counterparts in Russia and Belarus.</seg>

<seg id="72">Timur colon, owner of the restaurants "high-born N1" with Uzbek cuisine, sanctions also might alert: he will have to change, only the Norwegian новозеландскую.</seg>
<seg id="73">if Russia our owned imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we even win in the price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="74">from the CIS can be cheaper to get engineering, sausages, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit.</seg>

<seg id="9">the parameters laid out in the draft guidelines, designed to eliminate this obstacle in the way of introducing "европротокола" in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="10">according to them, the maximum payout for non in connection with the accident, without the police, must not be lower than the limit on "европротоколу."</seg>

<seg id="20">the Finance Ministry is preparing a bill that would prohibit savings certificates to the bearer.</seg>
<seg id="21">lately, this tool is gaining popularity, as rates here are higher than on bank deposits.</seg>
<seg id="22">the fact is that savings certificates for the deposit insurance system, and the bank they are cheaper because they don 't have to make payments to the Fund Deposit Insurance Agency (pointed out).</seg>
<seg id="23">successfully situation in the fact that this step will be taken because of the small and medium-sized banks, spreading such certificates, and suffer from Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which is estimated to have pointed to control 98% of the level of the market.</seg>
<seg id="24">with the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, is about 3.5%.</seg>
<seg id="25">the problem, pointed out, the explanation lies in the fact that customers bought a small bank, such a certificate, in case of withdrawal of the license is trying to get money from him in pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="26">some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates on bearer, may assume that their investment is insured.</seg>
<seg id="27">the absence of reasonable insurance payments on these certificated in case of license revocation the bank can lead to misunderstandings and social tensions.</seg>
<seg id="28">in practice, there have been cases when the agency предъявительских certificates to seek insurance redress through the court, "he said in a pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="29">the problem, of course, made-up.</seg>
<seg id="30">the certificates pay buyers still nobody will, by law, because they have no right to compensation from the State.</seg>
<seg id="31">if the case was that the tool is not insured in pointed, together with him and would have banned metal accounts, which means citizens are in grams of one of the four metals: gold, silver, platinum and palladium.</seg>
<seg id="32">since these accounts do not fall into the deposit insurance system, but their existence as long as no one deprives.</seg>
<seg id="33">it is likely that the bearer certificates are very convenient valuable paper that actually can act in the role of квазиденег.</seg>
<seg id="34">the move is not amenable to control: any bank customer can buy a certificate to every citizen, and to putting this certificate can change a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="35">it is no coincidence that the draft that savings certificate must be issued in paper value, which must be stored in depositories.</seg>
<seg id="36">and that ’ s one, banks are allowed to issue such certificates without the right to early repayment.</seg>

<seg id="2">the talks at the highest level in Minsk is not decided, for the sake of whom were called back, but gave rise to a new format: the first face of the European Union met with the chief executives of the Eurasian future</seg>
<seg id="3">the disturbing drift and let the (the situation around Ukraine отлагательств does not tolerate), the leaders of the EU and Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of "hot issues."</seg>
<seg id="4">it is capable of such a structure to work effectively, it is not clear; but it is clear who took the cream from that summit.</seg>
<seg id="5">questions on this one evening on August 26, when the Belarusians, and following them and other евразийцы with Europeans saw a change in President Lukashenko.</seg>
<seg id="6">the Belarusian leader revealed example отточенной учтивости, it was the behaviour of a man who had just caught the jackpot - and is planning a decent old age in high society.</seg>
<seg id="7">as Maidan Lukashenko helped</seg>
<seg id="8">the arrival of the three main European commissioners (of the EU), who met with Mr. Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf -- not just легитимация president for the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">this is an application for recognition of a full European policy and the campaign of the Ukrainian crisis.</seg>
<seg id="10">a senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Studies Denis Мельянцов sure: from now on, Brussels will not have to speak with Minsk in the same tone as before.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the fact that Catherine Ashton met face to face with Lukashenko, gives reason to believe that the relationship with the EU will be размораживаться and beyond," he said "Огоньку."</seg>
<seg id="12">this is the hidden part of the iceberg: preparing to push the Belarusian authorities began long before November Maidan in Kiev - summer 2013-го.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the results have been achieved and the EU is the successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues about modernization," lists interlocutor of Ogonyok which - and with the United States held talks on international security.</seg>
<seg id="14">States even took a little bit of sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="15">as regards the Ukrainian events, they themselves and reaction to them, only invoked another influx of this process.</seg>
<seg id="16">Minsk, on the one hand, managed to preserve relations with Ukraine are warm enough to not lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for talks.</seg>
<seg id="17">on the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who admitted not de jure accession of Crimea to Russia and urged to punish pro-Russian militia in the Donbas with all severity, and quarreled with Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="18">Minsk has not released any of the Customs Union, nor from the Collective Security Treaty Organization, and sometimes it is placed in a Russian air base.</seg>
<seg id="19">Brussels and Washington have a balanced position on the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated her confident Belarusian experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">how successful will the movement 's political diversification, will be seen by how often in the near future to meet in Minsk доведется EU + TC.</seg>
<seg id="21">the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy Catherine Ashton and diplomacy have failed to answer questions about what Brussels expects relations in the new format.</seg>
<seg id="22">a spokesman for Ashton said only "Maya Косьянчич Огоньку" that decisions on issues of war and peace, this issue is not a priority.</seg>
<seg id="23">while there were reports that following a meeting on the Ukraine issue, with the participation of the people in the new format may be, and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="24">a drop of tar in Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that on this, as it turns out, personally asked the representatives of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="25">nevertheless, the final briefing Alexander Lukashenko made it clear: all sides are not opposed to Minsk remained the central platform for meeting both Россия--ОБСЕ--Украина format, and at the level of heads of states and representatives of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="26">this means that "the last dictator in Europe" quite рукопожатного acquires the status of European leader that helps to solve a global problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">the farmer 's best friend</seg>
<seg id="28">already the EU delegation included еврокомиссаров on trade and energy, pushed to the conclusion: the main underlying reason for the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbas, and economy.</seg>
<seg id="29">in fact, сверстанное meeting schedule future talks on the supply of gas and to overcome the fear of the CU in the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU appears to be more extensive than peace declaration without specific dates and numbers.</seg>
<seg id="30">Trade Commissioner Karl De Гюхт, nevertheless, indicates: EU officials "arrived in Minsk to find solution to the political crisis which has economic consequences, and not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="31">it seems, however, that the economy and the crisis in Ukraine "works" in Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="32">its consequences - and above all reciprocal sanctions from the West and Russia - give Minsk, who until he feels санкционное pressure, with room for maneuver.</seg>
<seg id="33">according to the leader of the Mises Research Centre, in Belarus presidential candidate Yaroslav Ramanchuk, European investors are actively interested in Belarus for the supply of agricultural products to Russia in bypassing sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="34">under this scheme, for which supplies are Vladimir Putin at the summit пожурил Minsk.</seg>
<seg id="35">"billions of these schemes," said Romanchuk Огоньку "," are not the Belarusian businessmen and Russian companies.</seg>
<seg id="36">they worked for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes were destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Russian business urgently needs to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of the Belarusian authorities.</seg>
<seg id="38">the second story, "the expert continues," is linked to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are away to Belarus in the production of raw materials as well as focusing on the Russian market.</seg>
<seg id="39">Ukrainian producers have about 4 billion of exports to Russia, and the Belarusian производственно-торговые scheme now could be very popular. "</seg>
<seg id="40">according to Ramanchuk, the role of the host site for the negotiations, the EU and the CU is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of the development of economic ties with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="41">he recalls that the loss of the agricultural sector of the EU sanctions against Moscow are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the Commission is currently proposed аграриям only 125 million compensation.</seg>
<seg id="42">the Belarusian president could offer to Brussels to work together to minimise the consequences for еврофермеров.</seg>
<seg id="43">this could raise the authority of Lukashenko to the EU to unprecedented heights.</seg>
<seg id="44">hospitality without initiatives</seg>
<seg id="45">Catherine Ashton thanked the authorities for the initiative for the summit.</seg>
<seg id="46">but the paradox is that the official Minsk from his active role in the birth of the format, and the EU + открещивается Belarusian leader at a meeting with Ukrainian counterpart emphasized that the new format and it was.</seg>
<seg id="47">"it was your suggestion to come without навала discuss, not with бухты-барахты decide, after signing the Association Agreement with the EU, to sort out the situation, which at that time was in Ukraine," he said in front of cameras to Peter Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="48">however, observers interpreted it as an attempt to calm Moscow, she said, was initially against the intermediation of Minsk, which greatly increases his political weight.</seg>
<seg id="49">the Belarusian diplomatic establishment carefully emphasize that cooperation between the EU and Belarus in the organization on its soil does not pursue a lucrative target, but the ultimate goal of this format in the future - the creation of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.</seg>
<seg id="50">"this is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts which, in other fields, in particular in the field of security, and promoting the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation," said "Огоньку" in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, where, in the words of the select carefully.</seg>

<seg id="2">according to Russian news reports about his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government has stopped fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately started negotiations on the "statehood" отделившегося region.</seg>
<seg id="3">his spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later discloses that Putin had in mind the hint that восточноукраинская territory controlled by separatists will become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine, should be revised to give русскоговорящему region to protect their rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">however, Mr Putin 's call for the government to start talks with government-controlled described how insurgents with equal corresponds to the obvious strategy, which he follows from the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago, to help bring the separatists and the Ukrainian government to force новопровозглашенной Новороссии of de facto independence, to closer ties with Russia rather than with the West.</seg>
<seg id="5">in an interview with the state-controlled Channel 1 television, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return the territory retained in the eastern separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, both of which were seized in March and April, after Moscow, the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18, be much stricter in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="6">the Kremlin and the separatists recently named captured territory Новороссией, or New Russia, the name, which refers to the дореволюционным glory days of the Russian empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin said that anyone who believes that peace talks will occur in the near future, when the Ukrainian politicians to campaign for parliamentary elections on October 26, and while government troops attack peace settlements in detained separatists regions, "пленник illusions," Itar-Tass reported.</seg>
<seg id="8">"we must immediately begin substantive talks and not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the public status of Southeast Ukraine, in order to serve the interests of the people living there," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskov said that Putin 's words about the state had in mind in the context of a broader autonomy that was discussed during months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to allay fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and language rights at risk.</seg>
<seg id="10">only the government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions, "said Peskov.</seg>
<seg id="11">it is not a matter for discussion between Russia and Ukraine, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and an internal Ukrainian conflict."</seg>
<seg id="12">the intervention by the Kremlin 's press secretary, to rectify incorrect "interpretation of the words" Putin stressed the decision of the Russian leadership to behave in relation to the separatist uprising in the east of the otherwise than open the seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the population are ethnic Russians 2-миллионного.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would have to withstand much more heavy battle to attach even Луганскую region of eastern Ukraine 's Donetsk and, as the majority of the 6.5 million residents are Russians, and polls before the start of the conflict, showed broad support for the desire to stay within Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">autonomy, which Russian diplomats discussed at international forums gave regional governments in the Ukraine power themselves to trade agreements and foreign policy, in effect giving the Kremlin the actual control over the territory, which would be combined with the situation in Russia.</seg>

<seg id="19">last call for Putin to Kiev to negotiate with the leaders of the separatists, with both equal, followed new наступлениями rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks rolled into previously peaceful areas of eastern Ukraine along the Sea of Azov.</seg>
<seg id="20">Russia supported separatists took control of the city in which Новоазовск officers of the Ukrainian security services say they are afraid that it is the beginning of the campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory to the Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="21">this led to a large-scale civilian and military efforts to strengthen the neighbouring port of Mariupol, with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Новоазовском and narrow 27 on the Crimean peninsula.</seg>

<seg id="1">anger has turned out to be the most versatile and functional human emotion</seg>
<seg id="2">сердитое expression is biologically universal for mankind, and everyone involved in the creation of his body and the muscle is not fortuitous, but an additional means of expressing power and threat, researchers have found in Australia and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">about their discovery, they reported in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly about them you can read in the release of the University of California in Santa Barbara.</seg>
<seg id="4">гневное expression - joined by climbing in and down eyebrows, lips, the thin line of 'bloated nostrils - equally in all cultures, and make it even blind from birth, children are never who saw, said study lead author Aaron Селл.</seg>

<seg id="6">the more physical damage one man can do to another, the greater the opportunity for him to dictate and he pleads to partner with anger.</seg>

<seg id="11">anger, as well as in animals, a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of their own strength, force and agree to obey.</seg>
<seg id="12">the man the flames поджимает nostrils and lips with the same purpose, and a frog that надувается or бабуин, which demonstrates their fangs.</seg>
<seg id="13">"rage" is the "refusal to accept the situation, and the face immediately takes the form of effectively has demonstrated the opposite side of the consequences of this failure.</seg>
<seg id="14">but the most striking is that none of the components гневного faces is not arbitrary, they are one and the same, "said anthropologist John Туби.</seg>
