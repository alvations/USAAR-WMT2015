<seg id="1">Recalling a very American ideal that labor rights are human rights</seg>
<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have offered the bill, on which organization is protected by unions as a civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Where unions and middle-class jobs," says Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, who is co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive factions.</seg>
<seg id="4">That is why I am proud to represent the Act of expanding the rights of workers, along with the symbol of the movement for civil rights by John Lewis.</seg>
<seg id="5">This bill will give workers the same opportunities for legal discrimination against organizations, trade unions, and other forms of discrimination, opponents of stopping union power</seg>
<seg id="6">Changing the Act regulating labour relations in such a way as to allow the workers encountering discrimination for participation in trade union organizations, to seek justice in the civil courts, and compensation and punitive damages payments - a sensible and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it's certainly not radical initiative - at least by American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the best way to deal with the fact that offer Ellison, Lewis and co-authors of the bill, "recall is a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the attacks, which the unions have in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country, Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, to expand and to respect human rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time that millions of Americans still recall when this country simultaneously defend democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas MacArthur was ready and his assistants have helped destabilize the country to adopt a constitution, to ensure that autocracy which Хидеки Тодзё was replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly admitted that "the right of workers to organize and to negotiate, and the collective action is guaranteed."</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Эйзенхауер and his assistants have helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that fascism was replaced by Adolf Hitler a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recognizing that workers will need to be organized and to be heard in the new state, Germans have included an article that openly stated, "The right of association in order to protect and improve employment and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict or seek to diminish that right, will have no legal force; measures for these purposes, be declared illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">When former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was president of the International Commission on Human Rights, which was World Declaration on Human Rights, which in 1948, will be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and included stating that "everyone has the right to organize and join unions to protect their interests."</seg>
<seg id="17">Generations of Americans take for granted our basic position that labor rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country is advised by other countries about how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans have explained that the right to organize labor unions - and the fact that this union has participated as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - should be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now, when these rights are under attack in America, wise, indeed, return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to ensure that their voices were heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:</seg>
<seg id="21">History is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the nation's power, but increased them.</seg>
<seg id="23">Raising the living standards of millions, unions miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to fragile level of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack the unions, forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.</seg>
<seg id="25">History remembers the, how shall we.</seg>
<seg id="26">Official recognition of labour rights as human rights and the protection of civil rights, to prevent discrimination against organizations, trade unions, was long overdue.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the U.S., a federal judge on Sunday temporarily has blocked the introduction of the Louisiana law, which his supporters say he likely will close all five абортных clinics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to this measure, which was signed by Governor of Louisiana Bobby Джинадлом in June and was supposed to go into effect on September 1, doctors who do abortions, were obliged to have powers of patients in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nevertheless, the judge's decision means that, at the moment, doctors can continue to do legal abortions, while continuing to seek such powers.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Complainants will be allowed to work legally, continuing actions to gain power," he wrote in his decision, Judge John деГрэвеллз.</seg>
<seg id="6">The hearing will be scheduled within the next month, at which the judge made a more permanent solution on this law.</seg>
<seg id="7">Advocates of abortion rights, met with joy at the decision, the latest in a chain of decisions against similar measures, saying this will give doctors more time to obtain hospital authority.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today's decision ensures that the women will be protected as the Louisiana law, which seeks to deprive them of the health and human rights," said Nancy Нортап, president and head of the Center for reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the state's five clinics.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the decision applies to doctors from two clinics, which were claimants in the case, and also filed a claim on power.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of the 11 states that have adopted similar laws, and the courts have recently acknowledged such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="11">Key parts of the law that would have closed техасского, most of the remaining clinics in this state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fighters for the right to abortion, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association, that say the laws impose restrictions on the powers of physicians, which are not necessary from the medical point of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, though some also pointed to positive effect in the closing clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only one doctor who does abortions in Louisiana, is in the hospital, said the Center for reproductive Rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all the other doctors in the state will be forced to stop performing the procedure, the doctor, fearing for their safety, would cease to perform this procedure, "the group said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said that they would not punish doctors doing abortions as long as their statements to the authorities for taking decisions.</seg>

<seg id="1">What will the introduction of quotas for domestic products</seg>
<seg id="2">Not less than half of products for each type of product in the range trading networks should be the Russian production, says Duma deputy from the Just Russia faction, "Oleg Nilov.</seg>
<seg id="3">The MP has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures for domestic manufacturers, writes the newspaper Izvestia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The document will still some points, in order to avoid possible discomfort to buyers.</seg>
<seg id="5">This applies to goods that are produced in Russia. <... > According to the rest of the groups of products, which are produced in Russia, would provide the at least half of the production of their domestic producers, "Nilov told the publication.</seg>
<seg id="6">Together with the amendments, in the article "On the basis of state regulation of trading activities in the Russian Federation," the bill provides for the introduction of changes to the tax code, there is a VAT rate of 10 per cent in Norway with the implementation of products produced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea to introduce a 50% quota in -процентную retail chains included in the stimulus package for Russian producers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The shop appears several times more than domestic goods.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, this initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to attorney Налоговик, a member of the "independent think-tank" Public Duma Sergei Litvinenko for the Russian economy, as well as for domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive, and will lead to growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">The key will be, farmers, and small shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">They will be able to sell more, and that means that profits will grow.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, they will receive the right to dictate their terms and prices for retailers, because they will be forced to buy their goods.</seg>
<seg id="14">Russian manufacturers will be able to increase its sales activities and that will lead to pay higher taxes than before.</seg>
<seg id="15">This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, any industry will begin to expand any faster осваиваться, will be introduced to contribute to GDP growth.</seg>
<seg id="16">Russia's dependence on foreign food fall several times, though not immediately, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="17">Earlier, Russian companies are often unable to fight their way to the shelves of local stores due to higher competition from foreign counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche and sigh of relief can be freed.</seg>
<seg id="19">But do not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary inspections to the Russian market will be available food from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="20">In other words, it is now "calm" moment when former players have already left, and new has yet to come.</seg>
<seg id="21">Almost a month later, we can talk about the modern demand for Russian raw materials, as well as rising prices for finished products, "said Vice President АиФ.ru first all-Russian organization the Russian club financial directors, Tamara Kasyanov.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clearly, the idea of selling in each category at least 50% of the Russian food export sector will be for local producers.</seg>
<seg id="23">In that case, they will have to compete with one another, not with products, which are financed by state subsidies, are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="24">In other words, the buyer will struggle between the companies that operate under a single law.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, says Kasyanov, Russian producers are able to meet 50% of domestic needs compatriots not on all items.</seg>
<seg id="26">And in this situation commercial networks would have to "share" дотягивать Russian goods up to half that range.</seg>
<seg id="27">In this context, increasing fears that the shelves due to substandard goods.</seg>
<seg id="28">Maybe, under the guise of manufactured in Russia, will be delivered to foreign products with перебитыми labels, "adds an expert.</seg>
<seg id="29">A negative effect of introducing quotas are large trading networks, especially those which выгодней cooperate with importers.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is logical that the job-seeking foreign suppliers will suffer and, because of reduced demand for their products.</seg>
<seg id="31">Litvinenko did not rule out that the law on quotas on domestic goods may impact on consumers.</seg>
<seg id="32">In fact, that some of the Russian-made products can yield quality imported ones, while shops will be boosting prices on the second as a scarce commodity.</seg>
<seg id="33">About revolutions in the early 2000s, import substitution idea economists have started talking again in February this year because of the ongoing devaluation of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="34">Now, amid the uneasy relations with the West, the refusal to the import of products becomes even more urgent.</seg>
<seg id="35">The law aims to compel retailers under orders to suppliers reckon with domestic producers.</seg>
<seg id="36">Then we are much faster and more confident strolling towards import substitution and the planning system is necessary for the production of products will be created in a shorter period of time, "says MP Oleg Nilov.</seg>
<seg id="37">Especially effective mechanism for those quotas will be agricultural sectors, where the potential is particularly high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.</seg>
<seg id="38">Our farmers are able to fully cover the shelves in Russian shops.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition, a powerful impulse can obtain and uranium production.</seg>

<seg id="1">Inflation out of the vacation.</seg>
<seg id="2">Whether Russians feel a sharp rise in prices</seg>
<seg id="3">As a result of Western sanctions and the November inflation accelerates in Russia and not in forecasts уложится authorities, analysts believe, "VTB Capital."</seg>
<seg id="4">According to experts, the deferred effects антисанкций will lead to inflationary early in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the latest forecast, inflation in 2014 will be 6,5-7,5% the following year - less than the 6.5 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to the newspaper, "Kommersant," the ministry this week should make "small but significant" changes in macroeconomic forecast up to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the publication, the agency may lower estimate of inflation in 2015, which will eliminate progeSOFT expected revenue growth of the population.</seg>
<seg id="8">The forecast anticipated that the food sanctions apply a year - until August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">In such a situation, you could assume such high inflation?</seg>
<seg id="10">The current situation involves geared shock, but понижательный trend of inflation does not change, "the source said to the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="11">Economists from VTB Capital "don't share expectations regarding inflation and government economic bloc forecast price growth in 2014 at the level of 8%.</seg>
<seg id="12">The main effect of product bans will come together with the possible introduction of the Russian regions, sales tax (GAP) in 2015, experts believe.</seg>
<seg id="13">Inflationary spike in 9% in February, after which the annual pace of price growth will decline, experts believe.</seg>
<seg id="14">Incidentally, last week brought the first mining-related inflation results, after Russia imposed sanctions "accurate."</seg>
<seg id="15">АиФ.ru interviewed experts and found their inflationary expectations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Artem Деев, head of the analytical department of FC AForex:</seg>
<seg id="17">Prices have already observed in key segments.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moreover, when I began to appreciate the socially relevant products, the government was forced to launch measures to monitor systemic risks to price stability, in order to prevent unreasonable price increases in the short term.</seg>
<seg id="19">Suppliers and retailers already report on a daily basis before regulators that authorities knew exactly who, where and for what reason will trigger an increase in prices.</seg>
<seg id="20">Key factors for the growth of the consumer price index continues to be tremendous pace of capital flight, excessive refinancing the banking sector from the Russian мегарегулятора, converting on an internal flight in foreign currency, as well as an embargo on the import of food products from the countries that joined the sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="21">If inflationary pressures remained under control, the cost of a minimum basket of food has not jumped to 12 per cent in just one quarter.</seg>
<seg id="22">A ban on the import of food products provoked shock proposals on the internal market and leads to a final value enhancing логичному.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because at this stage we are not able to fully run the import substitution mechanism, as well as increase self-sufficiency of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production, a response to sanctions carry risks of inflationary growth component.</seg>
<seg id="24">If you add one and fiscal reasons related to the lack of credibility of the national currency, as well as ухудшенными prospects of economic growth, by the end of this year, inflation could exceed 8%.</seg>
<seg id="25">Alexander Разуваев, director of the analytical department of Alpari. ""</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 1990s, inflation sometimes hit 20-30% per month to zero, it was also higher than the current level, another thing that then it offset faster economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="27">I think, at the end of the year inflation will be 8-8,5%.</seg>
<seg id="28">Plato Магута, managing assets of the Fund Магута. "</seg>
<seg id="29">An external factor associated with sanctions against Russia, while successfully contained, but if there is a further increase of the pressure, first and foremost, for the financial sector - this can lead to certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations, which usually manifest themselves in traditionally interest-bearing cash currency to protect their savings.</seg>
<seg id="30">It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank and Finance Ministry to try to alleviate the weakening rouble, as well as smooth market practices and government regulation.</seg>
<seg id="31">But prices traditionally begins after a lull over the summer and, possibly, this fall will become more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="32">The target level of consumer inflation in Russia to 7.5%, most likely, a weapon, as Russia has another financial savings.</seg>

<seg id="15">"As regards the proposed settlements on the constructive elements, but in practice this is implementable, because the building has often used different technologies," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is no secret that стройрынок develops, thanks largely to the госзаказу.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the Chairman of the Management Board of the NP Экспертное "community" Catherine Лезиной procurement professionals, today, the state is the most effective customer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Deputy director of the pharmaceutical industry ’ s centre of capital construction Vladimir Malakhov drew attention to the fact that today's market is nominally divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and the company that owns монопольными competence and does not allow for this field of competitors.</seg>
<seg id="19">He believes that the creation of a transparent market is only possible when access to contracts that Turkey will maximize the impact someone's manager.</seg>
<seg id="20">Experts on the council was asked to form a government in such a way that one and the same performer may not receive more than one contract worth more than $1 billion rubles, or several contracts worth more than $1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="21">In минстрое believe that this approach must be assessed from the point of view of the business impact, and effectiveness of construction management.</seg>
<seg id="22">As explained by Elena Zhukova, in this case, you must be given of the general contractor functions, which will lead to an increase in the number of customer and budgetary expenditure on its content.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the same time, specialists will have the knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by contractors, as well as their safety.</seg>
<seg id="24">Often this will be investigated to determine who will be responsible for the security of an object as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition, this approach may lead to an outflow of qualified participants in connection with the state in obtaining state leadership on part-time work and a small amount of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="26">Deputy head Alexander Евсташенков procurement center экспертно-консультационного Institute, believes that the government has now turned into a business to Scor contractor.</seg>
<seg id="27">And this example: "A participant when completing the application must indicate the" specific performance "without specifying the words" or equivalent "," should "," "," "more," "less than," "similar" "or", "type", "a similar type," "lower," "lower," "higher," "can," "may," "might," "earlier" and "not previously," "higher," "not allowed" and so on.</seg>
<seg id="28">Thus, customers often abused their right to establish requirements for the content of applications of contractors.</seg>
<seg id="29">Another problem, according to Евсташенкова 44-ФЗ became necessary to assess the application quality through a "paper" member of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="30">An application by a participant, really can be assessed only a qualified contractor, but not the quality of the work, the implementation of which is not even began cooking, "the expert said.</seg>
<seg id="31">The quality of the works can be assessed only on their acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Experts on board was also asked to postpone a margin income from the upper echelon that had disappeared in the lower intermediate contractors.</seg>
<seg id="33">Chairman of the Expert Council of State Secretary, espionage, FAS Andrew Цариковский believes that it is not worth doing, as responsible for the order should генподрядчик.</seg>
<seg id="34">But otherwise, as in the famous репризе of Arkady Raikin normalises sleeping: "Пуговицам claims to have?"</seg>

<seg id="3">The house since the 18th century building is not changed, if not considered ветхость.</seg>
<seg id="4">Strangers here, as people go on tour, and residents are suffering more than delighted, from his privilege - the right to live in a house whose walls старейшем Ufa, remember commander Alexander Suvorov.</seg>
<seg id="5">Date buildings house amongst others, historians point to the two dates - 1730 and 1737.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in any case, it turns out that the nearly 300 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The old yard, always open the door, the squeaky staircase.</seg>
<seg id="8">Doors in the apartments are located near each other, chair covers were cracked, walls and peeling plaster просветы places visible from the street.</seg>
<seg id="9">It seems that everything rests on honest word.</seg>
<seg id="10">But local residents are told: "You don't think it is."</seg>
<seg id="11">Live in a wooden house in the 18th century is very difficult, "says Tatiana (1961, a resident of apartment # 3.</seg>
<seg id="12">The object is on the money, but on him госохране content not allocated tens of years, and we feel museum exhibits, about whom the authorities simply forgot.</seg>
<seg id="13">The last renovation was 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The wall is still performing well, though with great difficulties, but the foundation of the entire прогнил.</seg>
<seg id="15">Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, and моются once a week in a public bath.</seg>
<seg id="16">How can we be content in such conditions?</seg>
<seg id="17">The road passes directly under the windows, even a pedestrian zone.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tatiana curtain will put off.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now see what before was only heard it: Under the windows of the vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="20">You see, glass дребезжат constantly, can't open a window, and become accustomed to the noise.</seg>
<seg id="21">All the same, one gets used to the good and bad.</seg>
<seg id="22">Our apartment is still a top, thanks to her husband, he has golden hands.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, we have two rooms, three of them live with her son.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for other families, the conditions are much worse on the second floor, the ceilings in a little more than one and a half metres tall.</seg>
<seg id="25">In contrast to Tatiana offers guests the roommate out of the apartment, No. 6 Lyudmila Старостиной.</seg>
<seg id="26">Us woman with threshold offers up a cup of coffee and with a sad smile said:</seg>
<seg id="27">We have a one-bedroom apartment, 14.5 m ² for four people, and we live with my husband and daughter, with her granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="28">I've been here from the birth of another housing was never, "Lyudmila обводит eyes 3028-IV room: Sofa, two of the letter" g "; one of them was granddaughter with a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="29">Very closely and differs little from a domestic interior: Only the beautiful ceilings, "historical."</seg>
<seg id="30">But the ceiling is regularly flows: Tap system doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lyudmila said about his apartment and amazing at the same time, simply as an Italian house, which stands on the Roman ruins.</seg>
<seg id="32">They have brought in one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:</seg>
<seg id="33">Water spent about 40 years ago during the last repair.</seg>
<seg id="34">Then we had a tiny kitchen and bathroom in закутке from former self-struggles.</seg>
<seg id="35">We live in a time where квартировал Demidov family who lived on the second floor of the servant.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our apartment didn't privatized, and why?</seg>
<seg id="37">The median real estate, the privatization of meaning.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still only get apartment, can't apply for more.</seg>
<seg id="39">Already four months ago, promised us расселить promises, but then it doesn't matter.</seg>
<seg id="40">Not used to complain and I'm not.</seg>
<seg id="41">In this apartment (bedroom!) lived a whole dynasty: My grandparents, mum and dad, I'm with my husband and my daughter, with her granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="42">Things happened during that time.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, doorbell rats ran in the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="44">Look at the walls, they флигеля one-meter wide thickness.</seg>
<seg id="45">The solution, they say, he was involved in the eggs, so long rests.</seg>
<seg id="46">They built the house, thank Демидовым!</seg>
<seg id="47">Perhaps only as long as no one is killed, or a crumbling battlement сваей ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="48">Only building still slowly dying in front of us on the boards, and the logs, floors are rotting house repeatedly failed, we are pouring cement, but all it takes is a solution to the earth, as well.</seg>
<seg id="49">They say, and so is the concealed under our bathroom лаз and move to the river White, who had once lived here, the old Believers to hide from danger, in which case....</seg>
<seg id="50">They also pursued.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lyudmila Allard said to him came as a historian, he begged, he began to shoot in the flat excavations.</seg>
<seg id="52">But then urged to give them the house in exchange for its однушку prospectus in October.</seg>
<seg id="53">Lyudmila historian refused:</seg>
<seg id="54">Where are we in однушку over?</seg>
<seg id="55">And here is a little tiny hope that will give housing.</seg>
<seg id="56">We agree on the exchange, would not have won.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, the family Старостиных nothing won.</seg>
<seg id="58">The biggest dream Ludmila, their daughter, and one 16-year-old расселили with his granddaughter gave a separate room.</seg>
<seg id="59">Then there are the two families have identified two-room apartment instead of the majestic ruins, in which two generations living now.</seg>
<seg id="60">Pretty girl, and Olesya Карсакова apartments from No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.</seg>
<seg id="61">There squeezed in two cramped totaling 23 m ², referred to as apartments, lives with her large family.</seg>
<seg id="62">We just seven people, two children.</seg>
<seg id="63">See for yourself what kind of conditions.</seg>
<seg id="64">Your butt falls off pieces of plaster and window frames, the walls in the kitchen, and the cross-cutting holes.</seg>
<seg id="65">The water in the кране only cold year round.</seg>
<seg id="66">Walking about the apartments in the old house, so you can be sure that all the more fortunate spouses Lavrentyev apartment No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="67">They occupy the most spacious rooms of the first floor.</seg>
<seg id="68">You are right, a lot of places.</seg>
<seg id="69">In the 75 square, directed three man.</seg>
<seg id="70">We live in those rooms, where legend has it stopped Suvorov during his stay in Ufa, the head of the family, "said Aleksandr Dmitrievich Lavrentyev.</seg>
<seg id="71">High ceilings, spacious.</seg>
<seg id="72">One bad - all around the train wreck that is collapsing, falling apart at the seams.</seg>
<seg id="73">Neighbors probably already told him.</seg>
<seg id="74">Most of us suffering with floors, wooden planks сгнили literally went out of the legs.</seg>
<seg id="75">I put подпорки, wedges; in the hall still nothing, and go to another room, like in a seesaw качаемся, so all of you.</seg>
<seg id="76">The merchant's house Евдокима Демидова Aleksandr Dmitrievich can tell you better than any guide.</seg>
<seg id="77">Золотопромышленнику refers to the native, speaks of it with admiration.</seg>
<seg id="78">Indeed, the personality and the owner was fantastic: Кагинского Узянского plants built houses, отливал guns and bells, kept a Romani mines.</seg>
<seg id="79">Merchants take pride in an ancestor of real estate heirs, but live under one roof with history no longer want.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am settled here, even as a child, in the 1940s, the 20th century, "said Aleksandr Dmitrievich.</seg>
<seg id="81">Then, standing around a wooden barn, and accommodations for карет sentry boxes, subsequently снесенные.</seg>
<seg id="82">In 1968, wanted to remove, and our home, but something prevented.</seg>
<seg id="83">The same story was repeated again in 2014: Поманили new housing.</seg>
<seg id="84">We, as a team, gathered all the necessary documents, обегали instance, and suddenly learned that moving into apartments in 2015 or 2016.</seg>
<seg id="85">Something already doesn't believe in all this.</seg>
<seg id="86">Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture in the Republic of Bashkortostan, to learn the fate of their homes.</seg>
<seg id="87">Officials of the occupier was not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="88">Sent from one desk to another, but then, as mockery, given without signing a piece of paper and printing: "The Ministry of Culture is not objecting to the resettlement of tenants."</seg>
<seg id="89">Even though I have a feeling that our house has long been the city's first plan, because he was under the number 57, then became 57 A, now 57 / 1.</seg>
<seg id="90">As if it was demolished in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="91">"A planet" turned to the head of the User management sector median land Vladimir Барабашу.</seg>
<seg id="92">A house on the street of the October Revolution, 57 / 1 is included in the resettlement programme for the old housing.</seg>
<seg id="93">I can't be responsible for the actions of officials in the 1970s, only know that at the time there was a plan for the demolition of old buildings, despite the historical significance.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fortunately, this has not happened, and the current government is to restore the old house on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value, "successfully.</seg>
<seg id="95">Residents soon расселить planned for new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="96">According to Барабаша, House will restore Демидова Italian experts who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="97">Italy is now in the Biennale, and architectural project "Old Ufa" presented there, among others.</seg>
<seg id="98">I hope that by 2016 all former Old Street Kazan will best Western Hotel Tigra was renovated, "said the official.</seg>
<seg id="99">Home will look like a proper, who was earlier, three centuries ago.</seg>
<seg id="100">Демидова house, is likely to become a museum, open to all comers.</seg>
<seg id="101">In addition, at ministerial level the decision make pedestrian street at the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="102">On weekdays, unfortunately, didn't get too much workload of roads in the city.</seg>
<seg id="103">People from the future museum расселить Vladimir Барабаш promises in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="104">However, it is unlikely that they will be happy with their new apartments will be of the same area, and that the current.</seg>

<seg id="2">Never say: "I love you"</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was one of seven children, born into a family of immigrants from Jamaica in Dudley in Мидлендс in 1958.</seg>
<seg id="4">His father, who died when Henry was 19, he worked in a factory, and their relationship has been limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry preparing comedy, "Редкие records Rudi," which is partially based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of programmes on Radio 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mix of melody and rap, and 199.4 жизнерадостны ".</seg>
<seg id="7">However, Henry had to get through some difficult memories of childhood.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the death of his mother was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often mused about the relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was very inaccessible.</seg>
<seg id="10">You never saw his face, you only hear his voice: "Don't make noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Отстань dated sisters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Шевелись!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch the cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were older, when I was a child, walked with him in the pub and talk about such things as the shape of its teeth, the beauty of the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">I haven't talked with him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was the guy in the corner неулыбчивым, who read a newspaper for most of my life.</seg>
<seg id="17">Henry recently opened литейную studio in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in the days of his father, he was able to look at what must have been his life.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now there's a little bit better, but it's a dark, deep, have дымные netherworld with outbreaks of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father залезал in a bathtub and just lay there, and you have heard, as he slowly begins to sing about himself, because he wanted the отмыться mould from the studio.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I came back, I realised that he was doing this for years and years, to earn money for us, and I began to appreciate it more.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nevertheless, Henry came from a childhood devoid of parental love.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father had never cuddled, never said, "I love you."</seg>
<seg id="23">It was only when her mother became ill at the very end of her life, we started to talk: "I love you, I love you, I love you.</seg>
<seg id="24">The birth of her own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love with which he lacked in childhood.</seg>
<seg id="25">You can stop it, "I love you"?</seg>
<seg id="26">Just don't hug me!</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I'm 22!</seg>

<seg id="36">He was the one that killed her.</seg>
<seg id="37">So, when I was very, very recovered and I had symptoms of diabetes, and my doctor said, "You need to take drastic measures.</seg>
<seg id="38">Then I began serious training фитенсом, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="40">And that's boring.</seg>
<seg id="41">Nobody eats carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">The career trajectories of Henry reflected, perhaps, in his noble, briefly подстриженной beard.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since then, he has received recognition from critics for his Othello, he completely immersed in theatre.</seg>

<seg id="46">He started his career, when he was 16 and had worked at the factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">Deejay remarked as he parodies on the stage, and wrote about it in "new faces."</seg>
<seg id="48">His career in television began in the mid seventies: "Quite a long time I was the only black пародистом / first on television."</seg>
<seg id="49">He learned on the job.</seg>
<seg id="50">I not only had to grow in the eyes of the public, I had to learn how to be an effective vehicle for delivering jokes between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working on TV, and it was very hard.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny in the 'New faces "in 1975</seg>
<seg id="52">As his manager had the rights to the show, "Black and white minstrels," light entertainment program, in which people "чернили themselves face," Henry found that acting in it for five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">My family is a very disliked.</seg>
<seg id="54">I was, like, I want to make sure this never happened to me, but I don't regret that did it.</seg>
<seg id="55">Although it was strange, worthy of condemnation, I worked on large sites and was working with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="56">But the fact that it was "all light entertainment awards classics on British television for years and years," was "grotesque" and the black people. "</seg>
<seg id="57">Introducing characters who were abusive to black culture in the UK, and her perfume, Henry worked in alternative комедийном project in the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="58">The first season of "Lenny Henry Show," broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as, among other things, the chef Гэрет Блэклок from the comedy series "Biased."</seg>
<seg id="59">Commercials, documentaries, television series and roles in films took the following ten years of his life, but after his show on the BBC in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "what are you going to do next, Len, because some think you're тянешь time or quietly сворачиваешь aside."</seg>
<seg id="60">Next was a series of documentary broadcasts on Radio 4 called "What's good for...?"</seg>
<seg id="61">The first was about Шекспире.</seg>
<seg id="62">I was allergic to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">I cannot say that I have been taught this at school, sensibly, and I think that it is, in many ways, the prerogative of white middle-class people with колготками and cabbage downstairs in front.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I was very afraid of him.</seg>
<seg id="65">All of those we accepted interviews for transmission, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Денч said: "You need to try.</seg>
<seg id="66">It's not ругай as long as you don't know what you are talking about.</seg>
<seg id="67">Произнеси aloud some of these words, and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry read 20 rows last monologue from Othello for the documentary, and his зацепило.</seg>
<seg id="69">I had the feeling that I can do it.</seg>
<seg id="70">It's like my head выправили.</seg>
<seg id="71">"That's what it is, this is a serious case, Treat seriously, spacious, its text, dripping a little research.</seg>
<seg id="72">So, the process of rehearsal was tough, and I read this play for months and months before we got her.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">It seemed that they were waiting for a disaster, but it has not happened.</seg>
<seg id="75">We soon started Комедию "mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I was at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you have changed."</seg>
<seg id="78">The technical problem arose, and Henry felt instinctively that his case - to entertain the audience.</seg>
<seg id="79">"The Pacific voice inside me said: 'You have to work for 10 minutes, until they are computer operations."</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead, the assistant director, announced that the representation will resume as soon as the problem will be solved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I walked away from the scene and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."</seg>
<seg id="82">It's not my responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can't let someone else deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="84">"You're playing in the play, stay in the role."</seg>
<seg id="85">In "Henry in the theater Дачесс заборах."</seg>
<seg id="86">Learn the "Заборов" was difficult.</seg>
<seg id="87">Panic is quite useful, she strengthens muscle.</seg>
<seg id="88">It was good, too, so it was like a sign showing: "Here's what you need to do."</seg>
<seg id="89">He says it is, of course, Громовым voice.</seg>
<seg id="90">So I держусь this.</seg>
<seg id="91">I really love it.</seg>
<seg id="92">I love being in the репетиционном hall.</seg>
<seg id="93">By the way, Henry is still thinking comedian - all the way our conversation перебивают flashes of his humour, but when he starts, it finishes to parody.</seg>
<seg id="94">I just decided not to work in стендапе, because this thing with instant gratification from a room full of strangers, I think, quite dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="95">If you want to do all the time, this can lead to a standstill.</seg>
<seg id="96">I sometimes work in "Прямом broadcast in Apollo, when I want, but, in the main, I don't get so much pleasure as before.</seg>
<seg id="97">I ask whether he would give стендапа tour ever.</seg>
<seg id="98">The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think that will ever willingly withdraw from it.</seg>
<seg id="99">This is his new incarnation?</seg>
<seg id="100">I think so.</seg>
<seg id="101">I like to be an actor.</seg>
<seg id="102">It's pretty fun.</seg>
<seg id="103">You always tell a story, and here is a great place for this.</seg>
<seg id="104">I love history.</seg>

<seg id="7">The average market prices in the private, affordable and student schemes Berkeley rose by about a fifth in the past year, reaching £423000 in late April.</seg>

<seg id="18">They were not banned - nothing, in fact, not been forbidden - just don't lose them.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have become, as the very word архаичными "archaic."</seg>
<seg id="20">Public taste did what would never have achieved orders and injunctions, and as people choose among books of memoirs rich, staying in poverty, cookbooks and love the novels, of all the music they chose ballads.</seg>

<seg id="40">But at least he did not have to speak Эйлинн that Фэтс Уоллер was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">Given her age, she could hardly remember a time when popular singers were not black.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again, no laws or pressure.</seg>

<seg id="49">As she had heard only ballads Эйлинн was difficult to understand how offensive words, who had just sung her Кеверн, could be set to music.</seg>
<seg id="50">Music is an expression of love.</seg>

<seg id="80">Attempts by the joke often made him awkward situation, because, like his father, he was missing the soothing charm that could mitigate the cruelty, крывшуюся? Jokes in.</seg>
<seg id="81">Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.</seg>
<seg id="82">Maybe he wanted to Кеверн.</seg>
<seg id="83">Despite the good eye.</seg>

<seg id="85">The wine's intoxication, so that he could not serve as an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="86">In his excitement, she seemed lighter as пальмовые leaves in a weather system.</seg>
<seg id="87">"And you, I like you very much because you have a stupid head," she said.</seg>
<seg id="88">Although not like you very much.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was feeling sorry for her because of the excessive brutality of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she gave him.</seg>
<seg id="90">Whether she thought that he hit her?</seg>
<seg id="91">She has not talked to him about life in the cold of the northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that, in a fundamental sense, she was similar to здешнюю.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same huge icy ocean struck on both of them.</seg>
<seg id="93">The same man, and even more sensitive and capricious after that happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened than their ancestors, smugglers and разрушители, shopped in fury from pub to pub, ready to raise a hand on any woman, посмевшую denying them or upset them.</seg>
<seg id="94">Stupid head?</seg>
<seg id="95">They would have shown her a fist, if she was not cautious.</seg>
<seg id="96">Would be first kissed, kiss now became the most common erotic expression of irritation between a man and a woman; an antidote from fresh ballads, too, that the first kiss - Google her, and then hit.</seg>
<seg id="97">Excessive clarification, according to Кеверна because the kiss itself was already DVD films.</seg>
<seg id="98">Эйлинн Соломонз case showed that he needs to leave.</seg>
<seg id="99">He got up from the push, like an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She herself felt the lead weight, but the weight of his grief surprised her.</seg>
<seg id="101">This was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They barely knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">She looked, as he goes from an upper window and looked, as he leaves, her companion, the man himself to endure взваливший.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam, the outgoing garden, she thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">She felt a stab of sympathy towards him and men in general, even though some of them and raised her hand.</seg>
<seg id="106">The man, from the pulpit, with отвернувшийся back пристыженный knight, the ability to fight left him - why she felt she knew so well, if she could not recall a single case, until today, when she saw this?</seg>
<seg id="107">One Эйлинн Соломонз again looked at his feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">In the twenty years prior to the above events or so Эсме Нуссбаум, an intelligent and energetic 32-летняя исследовательница who worked in "Офнау" informal service control over Community mood, has prepared a report on the low and medium levels of violence in most parts of the country, where it was expected that it will be reduced, if not lifted entirely, given the money and power, which were allocated to its eradication.</seg>
<seg id="109">"A lot was done, and a lot is being done," she wrote, "in order to allay врожденную aggressiveness of people who fought in a war and won most of them, especially among these спутанных branches and narrow расселин terrain, where, despite the insulation изгородями spires on churches, gentle breathing human kindness was rarely in history.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, some quality, it turns out, неискоренимы.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher the spire, it would seem, the низменнее those passions that he зарождает.</seg>
<seg id="112">People shed sentimental tears over a skipping, drinking stories about преодоленных obstacles and announces its overheated belief in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness retains its strong grip as in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is evidence that glare and a vile задиристость in homes, in the workplace, on roads and even in playgrounds.</seg>
<seg id="113">"You have a habit of writing досадная too much," said her supervisor, having read the report as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="114">It seems to me that you should read shorter novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">Эсме Нуссбаум lowered her head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask you: You атеистка?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I think that is not obliged to answer," replied Эсме Нуссбаум.</seg>
<seg id="118">You lesbian?</seg>
<seg id="119">Эсме again insisted on his right to privacy and silence.</seg>
<seg id="120">A feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Again, silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I ask," said Luther Рабиновиц finally, "not because I am against atheism, лесбийства or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">There is no prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="124">We are the servants of society without prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="125">But some kinds of hypersensitivity, absolutely reasonable and a good in themselves, they may sometimes distort the results, such as, for example, those that you showed me.</seg>
<seg id="126">It is obvious that you yourself предубеждены against the church, and what you call "malevolent" and "rude", others would be interpreted as an expression of natural and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="127">Continue нудеть about THAT, IN THE ВООБЩЕ happened, as if it happened, if it happened yesterday, it means depriving the country needed her life force.</seg>
<seg id="128">Эсме Нуссбаум огляделась laterally until Рабиновиц said.</seg>
<seg id="129">Over his head, as well as pink comfort letters led repeated advice that "Офнау gave the country" the last quarter of a century or more.</seg>
<seg id="130">His neighbour, value their улыбайся spouse, listen to ballads, we walk, talk on the phone, talk, listen, fairytale city, соглашайся, извиняйся.</seg>
<seg id="131">The conversation is better than silence, word of the song better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I fully understand that you want to say," quietly replied Эсме Нуссбаум, when satisfied that her supervisor had finished talking, "and I don't want to say anything, except that he was not as effective as we convince ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">I am worried about is that if we do not we are ready, we will find that repeat mistakes that initially led to ТОМУ ВООБЩЕ IF THAT happened, happened.</seg>
<seg id="134">Only this time we выбросим their anger and distrust, not on others.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Рабиновиц joined finger-tips in the sitting.</seg>
<seg id="136">That gesture was supposed to mean an infinite patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"You go too far," he said, "calling" mistakes "actions that made or not made our grandfathers.</seg>
<seg id="138">You go too far and when talking about what they threw away their "anger" and "mistrust" in the "other."</seg>
<seg id="139">In your place, people should not need since then about the fact that, in the past, but it is currently defending, we're not talking about "us" and "them."</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "us" and no "other."</seg>
<seg id="141">It was the time of the disorder - and that's all that we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"For which, to be honest with ourselves," ventured Эсме insert, "neither part of society may well justify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am not accusing anyone.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it was good or bad, what is done is done.</seg>
<seg id="145">Then it was back then.</seg>
<seg id="146">Nothing to say - and here we agree.</seg>
<seg id="147">And how not to blame anybody, we should not make excuses, and, if that was appropriate, or if it was something you can fix.</seg>
<seg id="148">But why, if not to learn "</seg>
<seg id="149">Past Update to ensure that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I can add to that one word -</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther's Great Pyramid Рабиновица collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I'll review your report," he said, and dismissed her.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, on the way to work, she knocked off a biker who rode on the sidewalk, passersby, described as "a vicious rage."</seg>

<seg id="2">Manufacturing growth in the eurozone slowed to the lowest level in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.</seg>
<seg id="3">The business index (PMI) for the eurozone manufacturing sector of the public fell to 50.7 in August, dropping from 51.8 in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">The above 50 indicates growth.</seg>

<seg id="7">Markets will wait for the bank from a clear plan for how to deal with a eurozone recovery, as well as the threat of deflation, with inflation of just 0.3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi later this week may give further signals that he is contemplating scheme of quantitative easing in the eurozone, similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Although some growth is better than no growth, and the braking effect of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers becomes more obvious," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at public.</seg>
<seg id="10">The manufacturing sector PMI in Germany, a major trade partner of Russia in the EU, has fallen to the lowest level in 11 months of an increase.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the meantime, the bloc's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46,9.</seg>

<seg id="15">One positive was news from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.</seg>
<seg id="16">Howard Арчер, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that can be said about the August survey index of business activity in the eurozone manufacturing sector, is that it shows that the sector is still growing."</seg>
<seg id="17">He added: "Eurozone manufacturers, obviously, are finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension - particularly associated with the Russia / Ukraine - adds uncertainty still difficult conditions in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">This increasing tension, apparently hit by business - and especially on the confidence of consumers, and is likely to lead to the fact that some orders are delayed, or even cancelled, especially large orders.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said that "increasingly likely" that the ECB, in the end, of course, would have to conduct some kind of quantitative easing, "although we suspect that it will be limited."</seg>

<seg id="55">We would never say that they killed or dead.</seg>
<seg id="56">We say that they stayed in the gym.</seg>
<seg id="57">I remember my trip to London so well, especially in a toy shop, where they let me choose whatever I wanted, and travel in a car with an open top.</seg>
<seg id="58">But now he is afraid for such places as Ukraine, where war causes such grief, which he survived and his friends.</seg>
<seg id="59">This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering him</seg>
<seg id="60">"I'm so sorry to all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who in the past week, doing volunteer work in a women's monastery.</seg>

<seg id="63">His mother, Tamara, 48, said: "37 children, have been killed in this quarter, could you imagine?</seg>
<seg id="64">I remember the silence immediately after their capture, there are simply no children who would have screamed and ran around and this silence lasted for many months.</seg>
<seg id="65">She vividly remembers his trip with Дамиром in London.</seg>
<seg id="66">In London, people cried when I told our story.</seg>
<seg id="67">I realized then, as people on the other end of the earth can understand our feelings, can support.</seg>
<seg id="68">She was grateful, "Sheri Blair and its fund for the award and the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="69">I would like to call Sheri and simply the most to say that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting with her and her husband in London and how they helped Дамиру and me.</seg>
<seg id="70">I remember when Damir wanted to eat, they rang up all the local restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="71">I remember how he played with the waiters in the restaurant, Damir shot them from his water pistol, and they flee and played with him.</seg>
<seg id="72">And only one month has passed since then our nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="73">I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our grief and to support us.</seg>
<seg id="74">She said: "I still think that this world was no better over these 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="75">Now Ukraine is in a war, people are dying every day, and I think many children have been killed or be killed.</seg>
<seg id="76">It's just the same as our children.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think for many people, war is a news broadcast, that they listen to when they get bored or when they are busy with something else.</seg>
<seg id="78">I just know that these people feel, the horror of it.</seg>
<seg id="79">And I can't stop feeling it.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.</seg>
<seg id="81">Damir grew up and became very soft and quiet as a boy, he's quite aggressive and angry.</seg>
<seg id="82">He is not looking for revenge, for example, he did not just fixed on it in this last nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not like to remember it, but they are very close with six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and burn candles there.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember he was lying on the couch and away from us.</seg>
<seg id="85">Do not sleep, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys. Дамиру now 17, he was above me, likeable, smart and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that a few hours I was so sure that he is dead and that I never see him no more.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I was able to recover from the explosion and rose to his feet, I огляделась hell, I saw around me, when parts of bodies were lying everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely convinced that it is not possible to my little boy could survive in this hell.</seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember that I shouted at him:" Damir, Run, убегай, "but again I was so sure that he had not heard me.</seg>
<seg id="91">But he heard, and ran off.</seg>
<seg id="92">So life goes on for us, unlike so many others.</seg>
<seg id="93">Giorgi, 17 years</seg>
<seg id="94">The boy, whose shocking photo after capture was decisive for the Beslan tragedy</seg>
<seg id="95">Peace: Surviving Beslan Ilyin George with his mum Фатимой after taking over in 2004, and right now Giorgi</seg>

<seg id="97">His photograph was one of the most shocking character barbarism in Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="98">His mother Fatima, 54, the chief doctor, enrolled him in school in the first day of school before going to university, the eldest son, Vladimir.</seg>
<seg id="99">"I went away for two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so that my little boy was left alone on a three day nightmare," she recalled.</seg>
<seg id="100">Not just one, there was the family of our relatives, but they were all killed.</seg>
<seg id="101">Only because I managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="102">The closer the date, the harder to think and talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="103">There is not a single day when we won't remember this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="104">We don't think that it was a long time ago, I think that what happened yesterday, some scenes these days all the time, right before my eyes.</seg>
<seg id="105">No one will never forget, I promise you.</seg>
<seg id="106">Photograph: George западает in soul (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was увековечена into sculpture (right)</seg>
<seg id="107">I remember George wanted to go to school that day, said that a teacher who wants to embrace.</seg>
<seg id="108">I only found out that he was alive when I saw him on TV.</seg>
<seg id="109">But now even the sculpture is crying in San Marino.</seg>
<seg id="110">George doesn't like to look at this picture, and she was hidden in the closet at home.</seg>
<seg id="111">I understand, but I also think that the photos of people from all around the world feel our pain.</seg>
<seg id="112">George says now: "It is important that this never happened.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I doubt that we ever learn the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">People continue to investigate this tragedy and will never know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">Now they are investigating the collapse of Boeings in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Will we ever know what it was called?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world is going to something very bad.</seg>
<seg id="118">"I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, and nobody wants a war, because it is happening?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing for this pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need to have a bit of tens of years to forget it.</seg>
<seg id="121">It has affected my health, and I still feel it.</seg>
<seg id="122">About three or four years of nightmares because of me, but now it became better.</seg>
<seg id="123">I returned to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.</seg>
<seg id="124">I thought about my friends and одноклассниках who have been killed.</seg>
<seg id="125">That's why I continue to walk into the gym before every September 1.</seg>
<seg id="126">I want to pay tribute to the memory of my old childhood friends.</seg>

<seg id="138">Incredible: Georgi Фарниев was at the feet of террориста-убийцы during capture, but still he managed to survive</seg>
<seg id="139">During his capture, he was in the gym catre sitting next to a bomb at the feet of террориста-убийцы.</seg>
<seg id="140">Indeed, it is a miracle that he was not killed.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It seems to us that it was yesterday," says Giorgi, who wanted to learn from the intelligence officer in the Federal Security Service (FSB), but couldn't because of the damage that was caused by his health during his capture.</seg>
<seg id="142">It's still with me, this is not something that I left behind.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am older now, and they say that children can easily cope with bad events, I must say that this is not true.</seg>
<seg id="144">"In 2006 I worked with psychologists, and I felt a bit better after that, but I can't forget it.</seg>
<seg id="145">But I'd like to forget.</seg>
<seg id="146">In 2005, the next year - was the first and last time, when I went into the gym again.</seg>
<seg id="147">I lost consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="148">I would never go there again, and, please, don't ask me to show, where I sat on this famous photograph.</seg>
<seg id="149">Person left alive: George Фарниев today with an open laptop on a photograph of herself in hospital after seizure</seg>
<seg id="150">My pain is enormous, and I carry it with me every day.</seg>
<seg id="151">My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about my school.</seg>
<seg id="152">With regard to the physical condition, and I'm healthy.</seg>
<seg id="153">I need to be cautious with the knee, which was damaged, but now I'm okay.</seg>
<seg id="154">But health is not allowed me to go to study at the Academy of the Federal Security Service (FSB) in St. Petersburg, as I wanted to.</seg>
<seg id="155">I sent my documents, including the medical findings, and they replied that this is impossible.</seg>
<seg id="156">My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.</seg>
<seg id="157">I studied there for two years.</seg>
<seg id="158">He learns to treat all animals, from cats to cows. "</seg>
<seg id="159">He said: "I know that would never tell their children about their experience.</seg>
<seg id="160">It is not just about what children should know, and, of course, is not what they need to survive.</seg>
<seg id="161">His mother, Marina, 42, said: "The pain never leaves me.</seg>
<seg id="162">She's in my soul, and worse, when the anniversary is approaching.</seg>
<seg id="163">I'll go and will attend the ceremonies, which will be held, to celebrate her.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know that George did not go.</seg>
<seg id="165">For him it should be even stronger, because he was there, but I'm not.</seg>
<seg id="166">I was waiting for him at home, and couldn't help.</seg>
<seg id="167">I am so grateful to God that he came back to me... Here, in Beslan imprint lies on each.</seg>
<seg id="168">He remains with us.</seg>
<seg id="169">George, now an adult, but the nightmare was still with him.</seg>
<seg id="170">It is difficult to take when something so terribly unfair that happens to you.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was a boy, he loves the sport, but he can't do because of the knee.</seg>
<seg id="172">He had several operations, he can walk, but he can't exercise.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say that the 50 per cent he overcame this nightmare, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.</seg>
<seg id="174">This eerie experience will remain with us.</seg>
<seg id="175">Many of my friends and neighbors had been killed during the capture, and this only reinforces my pain.</seg>
<seg id="176">I lost a lot of people who I knew well and who were dear to me.</seg>
<seg id="177">My son with me, and this is the best gift that God could I do, but my heart aches for the people who had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know the family, where the children were born, but I know and widows who never married.</seg>
<seg id="179">It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.</seg>
<seg id="180">I will never forget how heart выпрыгнуло out of my chest at that moment, when I saw him in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="181">Now I look at what is happening in the world, "the war in different regions.</seg>
<seg id="182">These people are fighting for that?</seg>
<seg id="183">Why are they killing each other?</seg>
<seg id="184">The war is very close to our country right now, and I can hardly believe it.</seg>
<seg id="185">We were a close-knit country in the past, so how is it that we are fighting now?</seg>
<seg id="186">Men and children are suffering, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine, and many will be killed.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips, how to achieve a better quality photos and video underwater</seg>
<seg id="2">If you want to take pictures or shoot video under water before you a range of options.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is a waterproof "Point and Shoot," for example, the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or, for example, the GoPro Hero3 экшн-камера + Silver Edition, both of which sold for about $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I took these pictures on a family holiday with the help of several cameras, all for the price of about $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">No matter what equipment you use, the more rules you need to abide by in order to achieve the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Перепроверяйте their equipment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the case and any other luggage compartments tightly closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, set up their camera for the type of photos or videos that you shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some photos and video cameras filming or object type is regimes that optimise exposure for затемненных underwater conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in the water, notice how deeply your equipment can fall.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are only 5 feet, others - 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Look at our leadership and the ratings of digital cameras for both traditional and водонепроницаемых models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Remove a few frames - because many of them never get.</seg>
<seg id="14">The point is, "" LCD, which lets you assign shots, whereas if they are usually not экшн-камер.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have LCD, it will be difficult to see under the water, and the layout is a random process.</seg>
<seg id="16">So do a few frames.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also, if your camera is serial shooting mode, which takes several shots with slightly different units of exposition, use them.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">Significantly reduces the amount of light, and the deeper you нырнете under water.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, stay at the surface, when you're shooting in a swimming pool, a river or ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">It also allows you to transmit more colors in the photos; the deeper you go far less color you see.</seg>
<seg id="22">Подплывайте closer to shooting.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is excellent advice for shooting on the land, but it is even more important under the water because затемненных lighting conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is especially important if you're shooting on экшн-камеру: This equipment often comes with a fixed, широкоугольной lens, which means that you have to get closer to the object of filming, if you want to fill the frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was such a man, whose force of personality could shake things around, even in such a giant organization like the National Health Service.</seg>
<seg id="2">Консультирующий anaesthetist, he has devoted his career as former patients suffering from the disease and the treatment of remorse.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among those who spoke to him, "recalled his wife, MI-6 officer who had to live with devastating effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that while doctors were enthusiastic about being diagnosed and those who are being treated, mainly worried about something else -- the pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, however, he appeared to those who suffer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I never felt, as usual," he wrote in May last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was hard to find the strength within themselves.</seg>
<seg id="8">Struggling with symptoms similar to flu, he found that his wife, Juliet reproaches irritably.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I wish it was sooner rather than later," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Juliet left for a week, Lawson found that unusual and it is unclear why he was upset.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked a colleague to do chest X-rays.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks earlier, he first went skiing in the Alps.</seg>
<seg id="14">Results of the X-rays came.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was mesothelioma, a terminal cancer, which affects плевру shell, or lungs.</seg>
<seg id="16">For most cancers it is difficult to determine an exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although some people became ill with cancer of the lung, for example, not all sufferers of lung cancer smoked.</seg>
<seg id="18">But with attributable to mesothelioma differently.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, grainy construction material, who once called the "miracle," but which, as we now know, deadly dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us is disease mesothelioma, which you don't pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos, in the end, is the stuff from the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in the UK since the 1960s, when these industrial ban came into force.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even when it has been used, only people from specific sectors worked in close contact with him: Трубоизолировщики, builders, carpenters and docks, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">Industrial toxin from another era, he is hardly seen as a cause for concern today.</seg>
<seg id="25">But such a calm erroneously.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it turns out, is now at the peak of the epidemic мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="27">Here мезотелиомы dies from more people than in any other country on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="28">In the annual mortality rate in about 2500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease than as a result of road accidents.</seg>
<seg id="29">The annual number of deaths from мезотелиомы since 1980 and projected in the future, the number of deaths in the UK</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason we feel its deadly consequences right now, lies in the fact that, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), for the development of мезотелиомы go usually tens of years.</seg>
<seg id="31">And attack мезотелиомы veterans specialties is not limited to the construction industry.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was and, in many cases, remains in the house where we live, where we work, offices, schools, where we learn, and shops, where we go shopping.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result of mesothelioma, does not pay attention in class, profession, income level or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">Избранности bastions, the fashionable London department stores to private schools, as it turned out, not salvation.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parliament building is riddled with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even hospitals that are meant to cure us of deadly reservoirs, proved to be a carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was not трубоизолировщиком.</seg>
<seg id="39">Strictly speaking, he had to think where he might have come into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he realized.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It seems that there could be a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's hospital, where I spent six years on it," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">All are students, nurses, doctors and грузчики - used these тоннелями.</seg>
<seg id="43">I wonder how many of my peers expect the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">It was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial response.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Of the four doctors, who are in the hospital, Guy and we have subsequently developed mesothelioma for the past five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I alone remained alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us expect this disease?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Лоусону was diagnosed with mesothelioma, "" when he was 48 years old.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">To live so long.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty per cent of attributable to mesothelioma patients die within 8 months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is always fatal.</seg>
<seg id="52">So, now, we can only repeat Лоусона question: "How many of us expect this disease?"</seg>
<seg id="53">According to a leading expert in the UK, Professor Джулиану мезотелиоме Пито, most likely assume that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain should be an himself, about a wealthy person dies.</seg>
<seg id="54">Now the majority does not represent that die that way.</seg>
<seg id="55">Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada, Alamy</seg>
<seg id="56">A quick review of reports from the halls of the court, where victims are often seek compensation, shows how far it has spread attack мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="57">In June, for example, Marks & Spencer acknowledged that the recent Джэнис Ellen contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, apparel departments at two sites, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs Ellen was just 18 years old, when she started working at M & S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now her two children are older than 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Before this happened," she says, "I had never heard about мезотелиоме, I barely knew about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="62">And in my head I could not come, that it will affect me.</seg>
<seg id="63">Few people really know a lot about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="64">In fact, asbestos is not one substance, and a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">They get their name from the word "асбестиформ", which means the fibrous structure, which tells them the strength and flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="66">Of those six, three are often used in the construction.</seg>
<seg id="67">Widely known as chrysotile, or white asbestos, is much more common in other buildings today.</seg>
<seg id="68">It has been used in roofing panels, an outdoor stove pipes, boilers, thermal insulation and toilets, even in a hundred cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">He смертелен less than other forms of asbestos, but still recognised by the European Union and the World Health Organization is "a source of serious health damage," which can lead to death.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, brown asbestos (амозит) and blue asbestos (крокидолит).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts have speculated that "there are good, though indirect reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of cases attributable to mesothelioma [in the UK]."</seg>
<seg id="72">At Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the main store on London's Oxford Street, Alamy</seg>
<seg id="73">Джэнис Ellen may not have thought of yourself as a victim, but Julian Пито мезотелиомы work suggests that her story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that a significant percentage of мезотелиом when there is no known exposure at work or at home, were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment. "</seg>
<seg id="75">Much of this impact, he says, is "normal use and exposure to weather" in our building.</seg>
<seg id="76">No one, it seems, can't be sure that he is safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">Goddard Consulting report, which was seen in Westminster Palace, demonstrates how people, even in the heart of the Government could be exposed to unconsciously.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009, Goddard said that technical mines and pipelines for the premises of parliamentary committees were infected with deadly asbestos fibres, which may have given the movement, something so harmless as "strong currents of air."</seg>
<seg id="79">Members of the parliament often blame the fact that they are pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.</seg>
<seg id="80">Although the Agency for maintenance of Parliament insisted that Westminster Palace received a "clean bill of health," and now she recognized that it is necessary to work on the £1 billion for the reconstruction of the Parliament, by upgrading electrician and removing asbestos, and that after the general election of 2015, members of Parliament, perhaps, will meet in the conference centre nearby increased, not on the green benches was.</seg>
<seg id="81">Goddard report noted that "the situation with asbestos is not Poland, in accordance with the various rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">It is impossible to know whether this error management cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All we can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">One of those who have not managed to identify his contact with asbestos, Graham is the cost, the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson, the cost, and 50 years, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I worked at the hospital, which has successfully brought claims associated with asbestos," he says, "But I can't prove this in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It's so hard to remember all the places where I worked, and dates.</seg>
<seg id="88">He remembers clearly, so this day in early December 2009, when his wholly overcame something that was like the flu.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly were shaken as me.</seg>
<seg id="91">It started very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terrible.</seg>

<seg id="98">And yet his condition оставлось without a diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">Gradually, his health has improved, and he returned to work.</seg>
<seg id="100">But from time to time, those same symptoms return, often after he engaged in sports, and he breathed heavily.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, one of the patients came to him in office Эбботта with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma, "."</seg>
<seg id="102">But even then the cost is not associated with their own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">In the end, his patient was on dozens of years older and worked directly with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">In this case, the connection was obvious.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011 the Эбботта deteriorated again, and showed him his doctor консультировавший results of the CT and X-ray images of the group.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, just two years later, after the cost of began to feel ill, sensor, equipped with a camera, was introduced in the cavity between the shell of his shell by his chest and lung.</seg>

<seg id="112">Graham: Cost of mesothelioma diagnosis</seg>
<seg id="113">The cost suddenly sank during a meeting with Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested he contact a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">It was then he realised the scale of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"As it turns out, asbestos is widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos was once quite often in the pipes," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, now get sick with this disease.</seg>
<seg id="117">Thus, mesothelioma now affects more young people нетипичных professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous asbestos pipes isolated in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees, who were crossing the tunnels connecting nearby landmasses can bring together to get from one building to another (as Andrew Lawson), or ate in the basements of canteens (how often did Graham cost) almost certainly really were exposed to toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">For several decades after the war, as it turns out, the hospital was a place where, in theory, life for поциентов pulled, but the place, which constituted a threat to life for doctors who treated them.</seg>
<seg id="121">It still continues to remove today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students set their burners Бунзена asbestos on tap</seg>
<seg id="123">And it's not just hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and мэриях due to their amazing and if insulating characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="125">Schools too.</seg>
<seg id="126">Strictly speaking, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the classroom for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="127">Nationwide, on countless chemistry lessons, students set their burners Бунзена asbestos on tap.</seg>
<seg id="128">The websites appeared, highlighting the problem of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as floor tiles or roof сараев typically contained asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"This is an industrial poison, in a huge number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Лоусона Guy in a case against the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case, the only contact, the woman could remember was the demolition of garden shed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So be careful, снося garden sheds.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effect of the diagnosis, when we know that the disease is incurable, is huge.</seg>
<seg id="134">"To realize it, is quite a lot of time," says Graham cost.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realised that I couldn't focus on what I'm doing.</seg>
<seg id="136">I spent two weeks in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I realized that I had to go and deal with them.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I don't meet Christmas</seg>
<seg id="139">One of the most difficult things was the transition from doctor to patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">As countless patients before him, he remembers, was confused as the amount of information that had to be taken.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was difficult to understand," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked my doctor," How much do I have time? "</seg>
<seg id="143">They gave me about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember, as I thought, "Well, I didn't meet Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's all. "</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, as it is the mechanics of how we are in life, is the act of breathing -- causes cancer, which kills.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases are caused by мезотелиомы contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos is composed of tiny fibers.</seg>
<seg id="149">When asbestos is being destroyed and the carcinogenic fibers, they can get stuck in плевре shell, the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibers are annoying плевру and can cause mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem is due to the inhalation of asbestos fibres matrix," Professor Tom Трежер кардиоторакальный, surgeon, who came to the hospital in 2001, Guy.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is the hospital, where the suspect, Andrew Lawson, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="153">Трежер Лоусона knew and treated some of the others who, perhaps, was exposed to while in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">When Sally Goodin Sally goodun Etc asbestos into the lung tissue, "says Трежер breathing them unload on the periphery, where the shell.</seg>
<seg id="155">This is, essentially, an invasive process from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="156">The usual treatment for other forms of cancer is much less effective at мезотелиоме.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, cause hot debate.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some think that it is worth the try.</seg>
<seg id="159">Трежер disagrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">"You can't cut плевру," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">No good around her with a knife.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, the cancer is "not very good", which is "chemotherapy", but not people.</seg>
<seg id="163">"From time to time there are patients who live a long time," says Трежер.</seg>
<seg id="164">But ultimately, they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some patients are living much, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">Writer Stephen Jay Gould who died 20 years after he was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years after diagnosis, Graham cost continues to fight.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he became ill attributable to mesothelioma, Andrew Лоусоном Эбботта acquainted with who, four years after diagnosis, single-handedly turned into a desk support and consultation for these same patients.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Yes, Раковая Central," he said cheerfully when they rang.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," says the cost.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was diagnosed four years ago, and he still is very energetic.</seg>
<seg id="172">First Эбботту offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and would have prolonged his life only a month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was in despair," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, managed to give the somewhat more positive agenda. "</seg>
<seg id="176">The cost of meeting with several specialists, decided to continue treatment with Professor Лоиком Ланж-Лаздунски institutes, Professor Guy at the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage in that I don't need it, I just called them and they took me," admits Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">Likely the patient would have to get the direction and approval for funding.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money plays a pivotal role for patients with attributable to mesothelioma, to get the best available treatments.</seg>
<seg id="180">But when such treatments become ineffective, finally, inevitably, many patients are facing another financial reason for concern "about the future of the families that they would leave.</seg>
<seg id="181">And then they ask the courts for compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Price Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It has been known that asbestos is harmful to human health, since 1898," said Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But that changed in the 1960s, it became clear that even very small amounts can put their health at risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">It was then spoke about the bad faith of companies.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and hospital Guy ultimately resolve it, but it was not a "settlement" at full price, according to Morgan, as Lawson could not prove unequivocally that it was mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's hospital.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation into his death, hospital spokesman Guy is confirmed, however, that "the asbestos in the basement, mentioned above, was removed in the 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="188">It was too late for Andrew Лоусона.</seg>
<seg id="189">How to remove asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">In fact, tie deadly contact with asbestos to one company or place of work - usually through dozens of years after that - has proved to be a big problem for patients with attributable to mesothelioma, demanding compensation.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have the owner or shut down.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance archives could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who are protected from lawsuits, aware that time was on their side, the plaintiffs, of course, no.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, this year took serious new legislative acts which facilitate the process of recovery attributable to mesothelioma patients compensation, even if it is impossible to keep track of their former employers.</seg>
<seg id="195">In accordance with the law, was created by £350-миллионный fund of funds, which is financed by the insurance industry for those who had been diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove the contact, but who didn't fight with anyone.</seg>
<seg id="196">In such cases, patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in a case about the compensation of about £pirates.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected each year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with attributable to mesothelioma, believes that the £350 million represent a "very good job" for the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"This transaction, written by companies for insurers," he says, hinting that the sum is a quarter of that, insurers would have to pay, if not intervened, with a temporary period attributable to mesothelioma sufferers and would have been able to track down the company and file a lawsuit in the usual way.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even Mike Пеннинг, previously minister for work and pensions, acknowledged that the law is imperfect. "</seg>
<seg id="201">But Пеннинг, and Morgan acknowledged that, in view of the fact that seven people dying every day, rapid action was needed.</seg>
<seg id="202">"People suffer so much, and they need help now," said Пеннинг during the second reading of the Bill about мезотелиоме in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">By the time Graham cost was in the hands of Professor Лоика Ланж-Лаздунски 19 months.</seg>
<seg id="204">After the initial consultation Ланж-Лаздунски recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Трежера, he believes.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was followed by chemotherapy and radiation for тритерапия - in which the entire Ланж-Лаздунски boasts 40 per cent of patients surviving for five years.</seg>
<seg id="206">The cost felt a surge of strength.</seg>
<seg id="207">"This is, of course, is one of the most important things," says the cost.</seg>
<seg id="208">You see these patients all the time.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is a force that supports you.</seg>
<seg id="210">When сдаешься condition may deteriorate, very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham went to the cost of the operation in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">By the end of August he finished last of six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">Subsequent scans showed no trace of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had a scan in March [2014].</seg>
<seg id="215">There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I just happen to have 50.</seg>
<seg id="217">This is not a threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="218">This is the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="219">And again, the cost went through six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now there is no trace of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="221">However, this process is both physically and emotionally heavy.</seg>
<seg id="222">You can think about practical things - about finances, and when I die, for example, or that we need to show his wife, works as a timer on a big PRB.</seg>
<seg id="223">When you get bad news, you become безрадостным.</seg>
<seg id="224">You need to look forward.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders, protesters promise revenge</seg>
<seg id="2">China's parliament decided Sunday to not allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reforms.</seg>
<seg id="3">Such a move would likely mark the beginning of long promised protests in Hong Kong as activists have begun planning and mobilization in a matter of hours after that statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">Decision of the 11th National People's Congress, in fact, communist leaders to remove all the candidates who are loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's not обмануло our expectations, but still leads in rage," said legislator Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is not something that Beijing has promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">They lied to people in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defending decision of China, Li Fey, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the 11th National People's Congress, said that to allow public nomination for Hong Kong's leadership elections, it would be too "leopard skin".</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing promised to allow residents to vote by the head of the government, starting in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chinese leaders have presented the Sunday decision as a democratic step forward, since it gives a direct vote гонконгцам right; however, the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders continue to hold in their hands, with the help of the Commission on the appointment of candidates, rigidly controlled from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, according to a new article that only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision was taken after the summer, when there have been some of the most extensive and received widespread publicity the protests in Hong Kong for many years.</seg>
<seg id="14">For a large part of the campaign, after Hong Kong's Occupy Central movement With Love and Peace, which threatened to cut off the financial district in Hong Kong if Beijing does not guarantee true universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday evening, a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="16">The organisers of the demonstration said that their movement is shifting to a new phase of civil disobedience and that they rise up on the waves of protest in the next few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, they have not reported the details, obviously, to avoid problems with government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In онлайн-заявлении organizers reported that motion capture "обдумывало any central district only as exceptional measures, actions that may be taken only if all the possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We regret to inform you that today, all possibilities have been exhausted and the dialogue will certainly capture the central district.</seg>
<seg id="20">Authorities in Hong Kong were preparing to Beijing a few days, and on Sunday at the headquarters of the government had strengthened security measures involving police and barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">The unrest is the feeling of many in Hong Kong, that they are slowly losing control over their city.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of residents from mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also intensifies the fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, and begin to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying that his demonstration to jeopardize the businesses - the lifeblood of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protest, which they say, it could lead to a big economic damage, depending on how many people will participate, and for how long," said lawmaker Regina Yip, who has long been critical of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="26">We don't want to have to worry about the fact that Hong Kong is out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This idea, which is harmful for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chinese state media also gave reports in recent days, in which the activists of the democratic movement in Hong Kong were shown диверсантами considering Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral law, which drew the 7th - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.</seg>
<seg id="30">In July tens of thousands came out to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists are raising questions of racial identity and behavior of the police after Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">Unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Фергюсоне, Missouri, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">Coming raise hands, chanting: "Hands up, don't стреляй" while they wait in line in front of Mr.....</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Missouri Фергюсоне, associated with the murder of teenager Michael Brown, 45, blogger Perez said Miriam зоила интернет-разговоре shift among white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">In her experience, the white feminists stamps comments put gender above race, when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, as tensions rose in the Midwest and attracted nationwide attention, Peres saw responses of white women who is 100 percent focused on the race.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared with the reaction of black women shortly after the killing on 9 August, personal essays with such titles as "thoughts about Фергюсоне from white women" and "Феминизм is not only about угнетении appeared relatively late to women".</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Perez, they demonstrated a significant shift.</seg>
<seg id="9">"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who are talking about the white color of the skin and privileges at such a high level," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People felt the need to say something about what has happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's very symbolic for the crisis with which we are faced, and because of the situation in the Фергюсоне) is so tied to race, they feel that it is necessary to specify.</seg>
<seg id="12">For a professor of English at the University of Ohio Кориты Mitchell Ferguson has laid bare the challenges facing the American lady blacks face every day, but which are not perceived as "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner and get 150 лайков everywhere," says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">When I write something about how the colored people are attacked in their own country, "Duper silence.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Why are women so publicly talk about relationships, but not about the security in the public sector?" She asks.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women, like Mitchell, who studied the issues of race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between matters relating to race and gender.</seg>
<seg id="17">From her point of view, blacks, women are in a position to clearly separate these problems; they are faced with a complex reality every day.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women now bring together issues of race and gender in feminist мейнстриме, Энджела Хэттери, professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that its predecessor did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 1865 and 1890 линчевали for years, at least 10,000 black men, and the reason that is almost always served as the rape of white women," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="20">There was a white woman, was the story to justify Nepal.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the point of view of Хэттери, the gap between white and black women, white суфражистки occurred when, for example, Susan B. Anthony looked at the situation in the late 1800s, and saw that the fight for suffrage will be effective only for one of the groups: Women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They decided to lay eggs in the basket of voting rights for women, and the right to vote for blacks would appear later," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="23">Looking back on things like this gives us a clear idea of why women of color don't trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have not done anything good.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to ensure that the white women united against mob lynchings in the Women's Association for the prevention of mob lynchings of the South.</seg>
<seg id="27">This group emerged after almost 40 years after the women for the first time blacks had aid, "said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">From the point of view of Mitchell, the reactions of white feminists on the issues raised in the conduct of the police, "Фергюсоне, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white had a feminist" catch up "with blacks, women cope in several generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"However, it would be fine, if female, which have such a [traditional] феминистическая ideology, so would seriously for the right to educate a child, how they relate to the right to contraception?" Asked Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="30">The second wave feminists who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to контрацептивам, now starting to understand what it means.</seg>

<seg id="32">"I hope that women who have a different, but we understand the danger, repeated in the body, and a point of view on the racial issues that differ substantially from the general public - will be at the head of the change," wrote Стайнем.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Стайнем undertakes more пересекающийся feminism that involves issues of race, gender, and her comments about race in America still fascinate some.</seg>
<seg id="34">The American entrepreneurial institute researcher Christina Соммерс, author of "Who stole feminism?," she said She The People that young men in the United States, particularly the young people of color, "are much more vulnerable than their sisters," but the value Стайнем Фергюсоне contrary to criticism, which she previously clear.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now we have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for the boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">But when the White House has recently initiated a programme of "Сторож, my brother," to help the vulnerable black and испаноговорящим changed remarkably young men, followed the reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Стайнем.</seg>
<seg id="37">Police relationship with the black community is not the only problem, продвигающая helm of traditional feminism.</seg>
<seg id="38">After the U.S. Border Guard Service arrested around 63000 minors without the support of the country's southwestern border this year, immigration reform came to the surface again, this time as a women's problem.</seg>
<seg id="39">Andrea Меркадо, co-chair of the organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to apply this issue as important for women, she had only to share stories of immigrant women.</seg>
<seg id="40">"They speak for themselves," said Меркадо.</seg>
<seg id="41">When the vast majority of working visas are issued [иммигрантам-мужчинам], women who come to them, find themselves in positions vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Finding these stories resonate with women's organizations," she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Economic Development Ministry wants to accelerate growth in the market for electric cars</seg>
<seg id="2">This week the Ministry of Economic Development will make the government a comprehensive plan for the development of clean vehicles in Russia, told the deputy director of the ministry, Oleg Плужников at the round table that held a Moscow newspaper Vedomosti on show - 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">The plan drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals - reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is expected that the document will be passed in late September and early October, says the proposed measures concerning Плужников, electric cars and hybrids - a development plan for the vehicles to газомоторном fuel in Russia are already there.</seg>
<seg id="5">(A copy of the plan obtained by Vedomosti is designed for 2014-2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">To develop assessment criteria for electrical and hybrid vehicles, and to decide how to promote the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">The government report, which will be described in the tax and customs measures... to support, will be prepared by December 2014; concessional lending scheme and a preferential leasing will emerge by April 2015; and the proposal to reduce prices, stimulate and create a suitable infrastructure will be developed by October 2015</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014-2015, is expected to amend the regulations to ease conditions for the construction of the infrastructure charge (parking, petrol stations etc.).</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, federal officials plan for 2015 to formulate proposals for regional authorities to also promote the use of clean transport - in the form of granting him benefits when driving and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and suggestions about the expansion of government purchases of such transport.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, the Ministry of Economic Development by October 2014 will depend on the evaluation of the activities of the regional authorities of criteria that reflect the effectiveness of the support for the production of clean transport, the development of the infrastructure charge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Single market in Russia is still only formed in 2013 across the country sold around 100 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="12">In early 2014 обнулена an import duty on electric cars, so sales will be approximately 500 pieces, predicts, CEO of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey Pankov.</seg>
<seg id="13">But opened and growth does not make any noticeable: Sunderland in 2013 in Russia, according to the Association of European Businesses, the segment sold million passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="14">Until the Sunderland Russia imports only Mitsubishi Motors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Start import preparing Renault - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says director for strategic planning and partnerships in Russia Renault Nicolas Ремиз.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most of the other manufacturers of electric vehicles took in relation to Russia is taking a wait-and-see approach.</seg>
<seg id="17">Development of electric cars have and Russian manufacturers GAZ directors "," ",", "but the мизерный.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in January - July 2014, according to the "АСМ-холдинга," Avtovaz has issued 30 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="19">Modest demand due to cost, admits AvtoVAZ, director of engineering for Sergei Аманов, without state support the breakthrough in this segment will not.</seg>
<seg id="20">The development of the Russian market in addition to the new electric cars (those electric cars that are sold in Russia, on average, twice as much as analogues with internal combustion engines) holds an underdeveloped infrastructure charge (retails sites - units), "sighs Автостата CEO Sergey Целиков.</seg>
<seg id="21">Because of the cost and the low pace of reducing the cost of electric cars in the next 3-4 years remain нишевым segment of the Russian market, predicted "Авторевю editor-in-chief Mikhail Подорожанский Целиков, agrees with him.</seg>
<seg id="22">Car manufacturers, in contrast, say that some models of electric cars is already close to the value of the ordinary.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Russian Army market prospects, the important thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "real" электромобильность; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of new charging stations, group president of BMW's Wolfgang Шлимме.</seg>
<seg id="24">Such implementing infrastructure projects, for example, the "Россети": In Moscow, constructed a few stations, soon there will be about 80.</seg>
<seg id="25">Talks about building a network of retails sites is underway and with other regions.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to the director of the department "Россетей Vladimir Софьина, the company believes the market is ready to build electric and gas stations across the country, but there are problems: A small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging different brands.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, "Россети" as network the company does not have the right to engage in the sale of electricity, the opportunity to do this in relation to charging.</seg>
<seg id="28">Pankov believes the most effective measure in support of Russia's single market progeSOFT customs duties.</seg>
<seg id="29">Zero rate will act before the end of 2014, its renewal and expansion of the preferential list.</seg>
<seg id="30">The transportation tax to environmental (and the idea is being discussed relates to all vehicles) also support the market, but not as noticeably as customs preferences, "Pankov said.</seg>
<seg id="31">Vehicle tax in Russia is relatively small, "says Pankov, unlike, for example, from Norway, where the reduced tax rate led to a sharp increase in electric sales - now they account for 12% of the market.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, and the need for stimulus measures, such as free parking in the centre of town (as it has done in Moscow), I am sure Pankov, or any movement of dedicated lanes for electric cars, which are not yet in Russia.</seg>

<seg id="6">On the night of August 29, the White House said that President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will discuss the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The weakening of the ruble is long-term in nature and, in tandem with the euro, and in tandem with the U.S. dollar.</seg>
<seg id="8">The long-term forecast assumed that mark, "says senior analyst at Alpari Bodrov's" Anna ".</seg>
<seg id="9">All of that has to do with Ukraine, one way or another will be reflected on the courses.</seg>
<seg id="10">As long as this continues, investors will react.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, rumors about the invading troops not confirmed nor with one hand, but the market was very emotional.</seg>
<seg id="12">All the talk about the fact that he was resistant to such news, yesterday were перечеркнуты.</seg>
<seg id="13">This week, according to specialist, closes around these levels, and the rouble 36,90 37,05 per dollar.</seg>
<seg id="14">The tax period ended, oil prices, weak policies, sanctions, the issue of gas transit via Ukraine - all links in the same chain.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also, the forecast of inflation: The current prices for the autumn by end-2010 from 5% to 10%.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon, the same end, seasonal vegetables and fruits, and there will be a vacuum, as at other networks переориентируются suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The dollar approached at 37 roubles, went through it and came back, some powerful hysteria," commented Head of Market Analysis "Opening Broker Konstantin Bushuev.</seg>
<seg id="18">Still, will look at whether to impose sanctions on Saturday promised, as will meet NATO.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to him, the ruble weakened sharply after the tax season, then went to the news on Ukraine, the Central Bank, said last week that, until the end of the year, is moving to a fully floating exchange rate and waives any currency interventions.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you look at the daytime wobble, it is no different from the previous ones during this month, all have spooked that mark in 37 rubles, "continued the analyst.</seg>
<seg id="21">And so, in terms of the turnover of the powerful, nothing has happened.</seg>
<seg id="22">Worrying times for the currency market were, as I recall when, in late January, was the strong demand for the currency, as well as 3rd March, when the Central Bank отгрузил a record number of currency.</seg>
<seg id="23">In UFS IC and see the positive side of the weakening ruble.</seg>
<seg id="24">First of all, this increase in the revenue part of the budget from the export operations, as well as improving the competitiveness of domestic manufacturers at the expense of more expensive imports, "says chief analyst with UFS IC Alexei Kozlov.</seg>
<seg id="25">Negative moments can be attributed to the cost of imported goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency to significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, rising inflationary pressure, and, as a result, become more expensive for borrowing funds which, in turn, slows down the development of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="27">If we talk about the stock market, the rouble devaluation smoothes over a fall in share prices, expressed in roubles.</seg>
<seg id="28">For example, the MICEX index during trading Thursday fell 1.67 per cent, while the RTS Index lost 3.27 percent.</seg>
<seg id="29">Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of reduction of indices due to the weakening of the ruble during the day more than 1.5 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="30">The weakening of the ruble is an emotional character and can be explained by a massive desire to buy the currency.</seg>
<seg id="31">In practice, gradually emotions go on there, as well as the rouble zone partially or fully restore lost ground.</seg>
<seg id="32">"We believe, soon we will be able to see the value of the dollar and the Russian currency is near the level of 36 rubles to the dollar," said Alexei Kozlov.</seg>

<seg id="2">Восстанавливающаяся economy means more customers, the more sales and jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Account for taxes on the state and local level for companies across the country, moderately increased in the last year, when the economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study, published last week, and the company in the Washington area is no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">The company in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion in the coffers of the state and local level in fiscal 2013, to 3.8 percent more than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tax burden on business in the state and local level in the past year rose by 4.3 per cent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after avoiding each other years when smaller accounts in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">State taxes, rose 4.3 percent, faster than the local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to the study, which was conducted by providing professional services, Ernst & Young and the Center for taxation by the state tax policy.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of tax revenue in the county, 56 percent, in taxes on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of tax revenue for Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia, with 28 percent, is the lowest amount of tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="10">To a large extent, is caused by increased tax revenues return to previous levels of value of property companies, say the researchers, that raised taxes on real estate at 3.7 percent this year, after three years in a row, when growth was less than 1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large proportion of those earnings in larger states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same thing is happening in the Washington area.</seg>
<seg id="12">The company in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion in property taxes at the state and local level in the past year, to $9.6 billion more than in 2012 - a growth of 4.2 per cent, compared with the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the return of the value of the property does not have a similar effect on the growth of tax revenues at state and local level in Maryland, where the property taxes just more than one-fifth of the companies' tax bills.</seg>
<seg id="14">Virginia and the District of Columbia's pay tax accounts for about half of the state and local level, in the form of taxes on real estate.</seg>
<seg id="15">"What is happening in Maryland is that such a large part of its property tax base, particularly around the District of Columbia, is owned by either the government or nonprofit organization that does not pay taxes on real estate," said Douglas Линдхолм, executive director of the Center on taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, Maryland had to rely more on, for example, income taxes to pay for those services that exist in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent increase in tax receipts from businesses cannot fully explain the recovery of the real estate market.</seg>

<seg id="3">Duo Royal Blood a year just on stage, but he already has the musical award nomination for the BBC, in the opening round of the Arctic Monkeys and visit гримерку in New York concert from the right, Jimmy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Their self-titled debut is still several months before release received 100,000 предзаказов contract, but the issue lies in the portfolio will Warner Music.</seg>
<seg id="5">Given the present situation on the market, a musical плачевную situation is extraordinary, because it's not lambasted the new Lana del Ray, or another сладкоголосом representative "new R 'n' B ', and about the appearance of the British duo быковатых playing with the level of volume and intensity, that the last time was in vogue two decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">In general, rates on the first album in connection with all вышеозначенными circumstances were especially high, and is hollow.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is no coincidence that duo took his name, which previously could prejudice isn't quite so desperate that the hairy metalheads, kings and blood flows, as well as what they think, they have in the veins, too.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is, of course, primarily about the heroes of the past levels of Led Zeppelin, and the great quartet, Royal Blood aim to shake застоявшуюся blood, his British rock away to a new height.</seg>
<seg id="9">To make predictions about the success of this enterprise until, perhaps, the thought of saying something, but I can already.</seg>
<seg id="10">A dozen songs in thirty minutes with a slight уложившихся is not so much a demonstration of the phenomenal композиторского gifts, how many top-ranked and a powerful statement of intent.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some of the dignity of the individual, of course, cannot be denied: The pilot say, single "Out of the Black" is characterized by the fact that small melodic line, not a party. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Musicians jokingly say that this song is generally easier than напеть настучать.</seg>
<seg id="13">It will also highlight a "Little Monster" and provide record composition "Better 'quote Shakespeare in November with the title.</seg>

<seg id="15">And this is not necessarily bad, on the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="16">Force Royal Blood in the fact that they do not claim to be a new idea of Lennon and McCartney (rather too much in successors Motörhead) mark, but numerous рок-дуэты инди-клубов from the ghetto.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their music, despite some variety, created for stadiums, in the room, less than a couple of thousand people, she is obviously closely.</seg>
<seg id="18">The secret lies in how the man who took хитром bass guitar in the conventional format, with zero thought of Vengeance.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, it is not only the instruments, but also in the approach to writing songs.</seg>
<seg id="20">Heroes ретророка zero with great difficulty outside of postmodern mistakenly paradigm, with huge reluctance to admit to itself not just эпигонами and independent creative units.</seg>
<seg id="21">Royal Blood same now sound so powerfully, and the subsequent pressure that successfully драпирует some вторичность твердолобость and musical material.</seg>

<seg id="2">Amazon has just confirmed what Information on Friday morning, said: "Shopping online and видеопродюсер, and another hundred other things - streaming service видеовоспроизведения buys it for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).</seg>
<seg id="3">The news was not a surprise because no one expected that it would be sold, and because of that, many expected that YouTube will be a buyer.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago, selling it for a billion Google видеосервису looked completely finished, and this combination was a natural.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set a goal to be потоковым general service "version of YouTube in real time.</seg>
<seg id="6">Instead, he quickly became a platform where gamers aired their внутриигровые moments; "YouTube for games in real-time," according to Business insider.</seg>
<seg id="7">It interface.</seg>
<seg id="8">And the "pay for play" genre "videos, in which всезнайки give (mainly old) games, as in" Таинственном theatre ", already popular on YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="9">In fact, YouTube is mentioned often, when we describe it, so the news that YouTube acquires it was without much interest, a classic example of a well-established technology companies, выкупающей potential competitor.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's a mystery why deal with YouTube failed, given that, reportedly, he was willing to pay not less than Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">All that we have at the moment is a statement from Executive Director of it we as Emmett: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term objectives, and they want to help us get there faster."</seg>
<seg id="12">Another mystery, frankly, it is an incredible success.</seg>
<seg id="13">Снобам like me, who say that sports will be better than watching him, it is hard to understand the appeal of the games to watch, rather than take a risk in the hands of a joystick.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is one thing to look over his shoulder at 3 a.m., while creeping through the resident Evil, and quite another to watch as an outsider, a man gets 20 shots in the head in a row as Call of Duty.</seg>
<seg id="15">Every game that you could watch right now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so I watch them shoot, not controlling the angle of view, it might be the recipe for a headache, a worthy Do It Right.</seg>
<seg id="17">I agree that high-speed transmission, in which Роджеры Бэннистеры of our electronic age completing the whole game in record time, entertain.</seg>
<seg id="18">But if we are not talking about виртуозе games or humor, it's unlikely that his channel, it will be interesting at all.</seg>
<seg id="19">But I know what the skeptics like me?</seg>
<seg id="20">It had 55 million unique visitors per month, and it is the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.</seg>
<seg id="21">How Amazon works on this?</seg>
<seg id="22">It is difficult to imagine that it свернется in Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube would simply absorb it.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, it is with pleasure that would have received any company: The crowd of young men, of whom dream of advertisers.</seg>
<seg id="24">Like Amazon, it said Шир and it "both believe in the future of gaming," and the channel has signs of decay, even - ouch - as a sport.</seg>

<seg id="15">Commenting on today's bill introduced in the State Duma, the first deputy head of the Duma Committee on information policy, Leonid Levin, said that he sees no problem in order to move the date of entry into force of the Law on the protection of personal data.</seg>

<seg id="23">The statement stresses that more effective national security measure would create a mechanism to inform users about where is recording, systematisation of his personal data.</seg>
<seg id="24">In this case, he will be able to choose which of these actions will be made.</seg>

<seg id="1">Finding ways to save money on university textbooks</seg>
<seg id="2">In view of the fact that the cost of university textbooks for many students more than $1000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will go for a second course, came up with an ingenious way to reduce costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">He developed a system of how to borrow books if they hire старшекурсников, offering a nominal compensation that they delayed their sale.</seg>
<seg id="4">"My textbook on mathematical analysis, which typically costs $180 for the semester, I got $10 and biscuits" Chick-fil-A "," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying in Ковенант College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The literature on the cost would be $430 last semester, he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He spent $120.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the Council, the average college student spends $1,200 a year on books and supplies, but the students have a range of options to reduce these costs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas, such as Schroeder system.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rent books is becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book for the semester, and costs are often considerably cheaper than buying them.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Нибо Инкорпорейтид", which owns more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of rental books grew by half since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">Industry studies show that about a quarter of books in university bookstores during the past spring semester were taken, "said vice president of Нибо" Trevor Meyer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Less than half of all books sold in university bookstores, according to the National Association of Choirs professional union shops. "</seg>
<seg id="13">Here's introductory course on the best ways to make a deal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Purchase in store</seg>
<seg id="15">Sometimes, if you'll come out with a new book on the Internet, the cost could be one-third from what you see in the university bookshop.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis," Ron this, Bruce Edwards's and Robert Хостетлера worth about $290 privately, but a copy can be purchased for $239,99 site Chegg.com, which specialises in selling textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Buying a used</seg>
<seg id="18">If you're not made against others or the damage second-hand textbooks are a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Mathematical analysis" sold for $93,49 подержанном form on to Chegg.com.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Кэсэдей, 25 years later, a fourth year student at the University of Бригэм Young, said that paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for the textbook used copy of "strategic decisions in the media: An understanding of the business side of the advertising business."</seg>
<seg id="21">The book sold for $48.</seg>
<seg id="22">Teachers, for instance, Ingrid Брейси, director of "without walls" College at the University of Massachusetts in Эмхерсте, offers students refine their professors, it could use previous editions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates are insignificant for the class.</seg>
<seg id="24">In such cases, the old editions can often be found in a very small fraction of the cost of the last edition.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition to websites Amazon and Chegg, Half.com, "owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying second-hand books.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hire</seg>
<seg id="27">About to rent textbooks, think about it, if you're well enough with them, don't forget to return them and don't want to leave them alone after the course is completed.</seg>
<seg id="28">You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, a student could rent a "Математический analysis" for a semester, for about $20.</seg>
<seg id="30">Find out what the store, where you take the books, including any fines that you can write notes in the gallery, and damage.</seg>
<seg id="31">If you take a book, remember: If you don't book, will regain fines may even exceed the cost of the new instance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Electronic books</seg>
<seg id="33">Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks is another option.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sometimes, these books take the rent, buying electronic license for a certain period for retailers, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rent "Mathematical Analysis" on the Web site Chegg.com for six months will cost approximately $61.</seg>
<seg id="36">Брейси says that students who study literature, can often find the most advantageous prices, as many of the classics are now free, whereas literature on natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.</seg>
<seg id="37">Despite that, осмотритесь.</seg>
<seg id="38">Joe Голт, 29 years old, which is going to start their studies in high school, and recommends Legal Пеппердин use ISBN numbers to gauge prices for the book, because it ensures that you are looking for precisely the right you text.</seg>
<seg id="39">But before you order online, "says Голт, be sure to check whether a book is in stock.</seg>
<seg id="40">To him this lesson Hemsedal is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="41">Delivery of the books, which he has acquired was postponed for four weeks, and, in the end, he paid the full price in the university bookshop.</seg>

<seg id="40">On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree applying specific economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which is basically food sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="41">The country banned the import of pork, beef, a by-product from meat and poultry, meat, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cheese, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausage and sugar syrups.</seg>
<seg id="42">Restaurants have begun чехарда with suppliers: Prices for food rose, there is an urgent need to seek counterparts from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="43">This will affect the most expensive restaurants монокухней from France, Italy, Spain, in which products supplied directly from the "maternal" countries.</seg>
<seg id="44">Общепиту education had before.</seg>
<seg id="45">For example, when, at the beginning of 2014, the Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and the year before - the American and Canadian meat.</seg>
<seg id="46">Suppliers established in return for supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="47">But лета-2014 proved to be much more serious sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which lifted the ban on Atlantic salmon and trout fry безлактозное, milk, seed potatoes, corn, peas and onions сахарную for replanting.</seg>
<seg id="49">The Italian Валерио hopes that sanctions might still смягчиться.</seg>

<seg id="51">According to the company, "East-West", one of the largest suppliers of imported products in the HoReCa premium segment accounted for up to 70%.</seg>
<seg id="52">"The expensive restaurants to change their menus under the produce of local farmers and other countries," says Sergei Mironov, Resurrection, owner of the agency "Рестконсалт."</seg>
<seg id="53">If we are strong, for him it's not going to be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="54">But we have very little such chefs, and the development of new menu items may take two to three months.</seg>
<seg id="55">From the restaurant Brasserie Тригель "Bridge" prepared: Withdraw from 10-15% to dishes, yet half the menu - to recycle.</seg>
<seg id="56">In restaurants with assorted kitchen are starting to replace dishes, for example steak of beef -- Beef Stroganoff the marble, "says Sergei Mironov.</seg>
<seg id="57">"The cheeses from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian cheeses and cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile - lists the" East-West "Oksana Глибчук.</seg>

<seg id="59">Chicken from the United States may be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus, and salmon from Norway семга - salmon, семгой, those from Belarus and Chile.</seg>

<seg id="62">Although it is difficult to have institutions Ginza Project, he says.</seg>
<seg id="63">The Ginza Project, several dozen restaurants under various brands and with their menu.</seg>

<seg id="72">Timur colon, owner of the restaurants "Чайхона N1" with Uzbek cuisine, sanctions aren't too: He will have to change only sausages in New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="73">If our owned Russia imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we even win in price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="74">From the CIS can be cheaper to get to engineering, sausages, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit.</seg>

<seg id="8">Because if the policy has been to get the refund certificate was not without traffic.</seg>
<seg id="9">Parameters laid out in the draft guidelines, and are designed to eliminate this obstacle in the way of implementation 'европротокола "in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to them, the maximum payout has been in connection with the accident, without the police, must not be lower than the limit for "европротоколу."</seg>
<seg id="11">But at the same time, she can't be above a certain limit, the treaty has insurance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The idea, of course, useful and theoretically capable of relieving both its employees and the road.</seg>
<seg id="13">But, more likely, it will not delight neither drivers nor insurers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Last now talk about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which could lead to the introduction of new rules on payments has.</seg>
<seg id="15">As for the drivers, it is difficult to imagine what kind of work will have to be done, so as to overcome Russian conservatism.</seg>
<seg id="16">In most cases, the driver would wait for inspectors, to a minor car accident, because more robust.</seg>
<seg id="17">And we still do not know what will be easier -- or to convince drivers to win swindlers "европротокола reliability."</seg>
<seg id="18">Savings certificate makes personalised and irrevocable</seg>
<seg id="19">The Ministry of Finance wants ban on bearer savings certificates, but will allow banks to make them equivalent безотзывного contribution.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Finance Ministry is preparing a bill that would prohibit savings certificates to the bearer.</seg>
<seg id="21">In recent times, this tool is gaining popularity, as rates are higher here than on bank deposits.</seg>
<seg id="22">In fact, savings certificates on the bearer not the bank deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper because they don't have to make payments to the Fund Deposit Insurance Agency (pointed out).</seg>
<seg id="23">Successfully situation that is expected to take this step because of the small and medium-sized banks, spreading such certificates, and suffer from Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which is estimated to control pointed out that 98% of the level of the market.</seg>
<seg id="24">With the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, which is about 3.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="25">The problem, explains pointed out, lies in the fact that a small bank customers who bought such a certificate, in case of license revocation if he is trying to get money in pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates on bearer, may assume that their investment is insured.</seg>
<seg id="27">The absence of reasonable insurance payments on these certificated in case of license revocation if the bank can lead to misunderstandings and social tensions.</seg>
<seg id="28">In practice, there have been cases in which the agency issuing the certificate предъявительских tried to seek redress through the courts, "he said in a pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="29">The problem, of course, made-up.</seg>
<seg id="30">The certificates pay buyers still nobody will, because under the law they have no right to compensation from the State.</seg>
<seg id="31">If this was in fact an instrument that is insured in pointed, together with him and would have banned metal accounts, which means citizens are one of four grams in precious metals, gold, silver, platinum and palladium.</seg>
<seg id="32">Since these accounts do not fall into a system of deposit insurance, but their existence until nobody deprives.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is likely that the bearer certificates are very comfortable, which actually can act in the role of квазиденег.</seg>
<seg id="34">With almost no control of their movement: The bank can buy a certificate to any citizen, and such a change could be cashing lots of bosses.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is not by chance that the draft that savings certificate must be issued in paper value, which must be stored in depositories.</seg>
<seg id="36">But Putin ’ s banks are allowed to issue such certificates without the right to early repayment.</seg>
<seg id="37">They have introduced similar безотзывного contribution, which has long been a dream of the bankers.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the highest level talks in Minsk is not decided, for the sake of problems which were called back, but created a new format: The first European Union officials met with the chief executives of the Eurasian future</seg>
<seg id="3">If lifestyle changes have fuelled an alarming and concerning the situation around Ukraine (very urgent does not tolerate), the leaders of the EU and Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of "hot issues."</seg>
<seg id="4">Whether or not this structure can work effectively, it is unclear; but it is clear who withdrew from the cream of this summit.</seg>
<seg id="5">Questions on this one evening on August 26, when the Belarusians, and followed them and other евразийцы Europeans saw a television with a new President Lukashenko.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Belarusian leader revealed отточенной example of talent, it's the behavior of a man who had just caught the jackpot - and is planning a decent old age in high society.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Maidan helped Lukashenko</seg>
<seg id="8">Arrival in Minsk just three major European commissioners (of EU ministers), who met with Mr. Lukashenko and allowed him to play in the final briefing on their behalf -- not just легитимация president for the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is an application for recognition of a full European policy and the campaign of the Ukrainian crisis.</seg>
<seg id="10">A senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Studies: Denis Мельянцов believes that Brussels would not have to talk to Minsk in the same tone as before.</seg>
<seg id="11">"What Catherine Ashton met face to face with Lukashenko, gives reason to believe that the relationship with the EU will be размораживаться and beyond," he said "Огоньку."</seg>
<seg id="12">This is the tip of the iceberg hidden part: Preparing to push the Belarusian authorities began long before November Maidan in Kiev - 2013-го last summer.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The results have been achieved and the EU is the successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues about modernization," lists interlocutor of Ogonyok which had -- and with the United States held talks on international security.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even some United States removed sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="15">As regards the Ukrainian events, then they themselves and reaction to them, only Belarus invoked another influx of this process.</seg>
<seg id="16">Minsk, on the one hand, managed to preserve relations with Ukraine are warm enough, to not lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for talks.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other hand, the leader of the Senate, which has not recognized the annexation of Crimea by Russia and urged to punish pro-Russian militia in the Donbas with the severity, and quarreled with Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="18">Minsk has not released any of the Customs Union, nor from the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), and the web is a Russian air base.</seg>
<seg id="19">Brussels and Washington have noticed a balanced position on the Ukraine issue in Minsk - and appreciated her confident Belarusian experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">How successful will be Lukashenko's political movement to diversify, will be seen as often in the near future to meet in Minsk ever EU format + TC.</seg>
<seg id="21">The press office of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy Catherine Ashton and diplomacy have failed to answer questions about what Brussels expects relations in the new format.</seg>
<seg id="22">A spokesman for Ashton said only "Maya Косьянчич Огоньку" that decisions on issues of war and peace, this issue is not a priority.</seg>
<seg id="23">While there are reports that following a meeting on the Ukraine issue involving officials in the new format may be, and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="24">A drop of tar in Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that about him, it turns out, personally asked representatives of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nevertheless, the final briefing Alexander Lukashenko made it clear: All parties opposed to the Minsk, remained the central platform for meeting both Россия--ОБСЕ--Украина format, and at the level of Heads of State and high representatives of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="26">This means that "the last dictator in Europe" quite рукопожатного acquires the status of a European leader who helps solve a global problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">Farmer's best friend</seg>
<seg id="28">Already the EU delegation, which included еврокомиссаров on trade and energy, pushed to the conclusion: The main underlying reason for the summit -- not the tragic situation in the Donbas, and economy.</seg>
<seg id="29">In fact, сверстанное meeting schedule future talks on the gas supply and to overcome the fear of CU on the agreement about an association between Ukraine and the EU looks more robust than the achievement of peace declaration without specific dates and numbers.</seg>
<seg id="30">Trade Commissioner Karl De Гюхт, nevertheless, on EU representatives: "Arrived in Minsk to seek a political solution to the crisis which has economic consequences, and not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="31">It seems, however, that the economy and the crisis in Ukraine "works" in Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its consequences - and primarily reciprocal sanctions from the West and Russia, offer cut-price, who is himself under pressure, yet санкционное with room for maneuver.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to the head of the Mises Research Centre, Yaroslav Романчука Belarus, European investors are actively interested in opportunities for agricultural exports to Russia to bypass sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="34">Under this scheme, which is nominated for President Vladimir Putin in Minsk summit пожурил.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Billions of these schemes," said Romanchuk Огоньку "," are not the Belarusian businessmen and Russian companies.</seg>
<seg id="36">They worked on a scheme for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes were destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Russian business is in desperate need of something to restore them, even through the mediation of the Belarusian authorities.</seg>
<seg id="38">The second story, "the expert continues," is linked to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not averse to establish production in Belarus from the raw materials are also focusing on the Russian market.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Ukrainian producers about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and the Belarusian производственно-торговые scheme now could be very popular. "</seg>
<seg id="40">According to Романчука, the role of the host site for the negotiations, the EU and the CU is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of the development of economic ties with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="41">He recalls that the losses from the agricultural sector, the EU sanctions against Moscow are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the Commission is currently proposed 5.45 only 125 million euros in compensation.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Belarusian president could offer to Brussels to work together to minimise the consequences for еврофермеров.</seg>
<seg id="43">This could raise the authority of Lukashenko to the EU to unprecedented heights.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hospitality without initiatives</seg>
<seg id="45">Catherine Ashton, the Belarusian authorities have thanked the initiative for the summit.</seg>
<seg id="46">But the paradox is that Minsk from his active role in the birth of the CU + открещивается EU format, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with Ukrainian counterpart emphasized that the new format and it was.</seg>
<seg id="47">"It was your suggestion to come, without any навала discuss, not with бухты-барахты decide, after signing the Association Agreement with the EU, to sort out the situation, which at that time was in Ukraine," he said, before the cameras by Peter Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, observers interpreted it as an attempt to mollify Moscow, she reportedly was initially against the intermediation of Minsk, which greatly increases his political weight.</seg>
<seg id="49">In Belarusian diplomatic establishment carefully emphasize that cooperation between the EU and Belarus in the organization on its soil does not pursue the goal of pursuing such a format, but the ultimate goal is to create in the future, a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.</seg>
<seg id="50">"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts which, in other fields, in particular in the field of security, and promotes the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation," the Foreign Ministry said "Огоньку" in Belarus, which has, in recent times, with the word gradual.</seg>

<seg id="18">The main problem, "Cities грехов-2" is in another.</seg>
<seg id="19">Frank Miller was good, because both рисовальщик joined comic нуар and bed, and as a director - turned the idea of how the transposition of comics on the screen.</seg>

<seg id="1">Anger has turned out to be the most versatile and functional human emotion</seg>
<seg id="2">Сердитое expression is biologically universal for mankind, and everyone involved in its creation and body muscle group is significant, and is an additional means of expressing power and threat, researchers have found in Australia and the US.</seg>
<seg id="3">About their discovery, they reported in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly, you can read about them in the press release of the University of California in Santa Barbara.</seg>
<seg id="4">Good facial expression down - and joined his eyebrows, lips, the thin line вытянутые in 2030 nostrils - equally in all cultures, and make it even blind from birth, children who don't have it, "said study lead author Aaron Селл.</seg>
<seg id="5">As part of a major research project on the nature of the anger, the scientists found that arose this emotion for the effective conduct of disputes during the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="6">The more physical damage one man can do to another, the greater the opportunity for him to dictate and he pleads to partner with anger.</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers have confirmed their hypothesis: Physically and other powerful people often get angry and switch to pitch invasions, consider themselves entitled to impose other disadvantageous conditions for them, and they prefer the methods of solving conflicts peacefully.</seg>
<seg id="8">Extrapolating from that anger is a bargaining emotion, "first and foremost," the scientists decided that the movement of each of the seven groups of muscles, creating сердитое expression must represent гневающегося individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of a friend - and thereby force as soon as possible to agree to its terms in order to avoid conflict.</seg>
<seg id="9">To test this hypothesis, the researchers have modelled on a computer, where officials had absent or of each of the seven items гневного face, and showed them but.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although his eyebrows and chin forward separately have not done an evil person, portrayed with such human traits of more powerful, physically the study participants acknowledged unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="11">The anger of a man, as well as in animals, a threat is exaggerated: Manifestation of his own forces, underwrite and agree to obey.</seg>
<seg id="12">Man inflated поджимает nostrils and lips with the same goal, and that frog, which надувается or бабуин, which demonstrates their fangs.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Anger" runs "refusal to accept the situation, a friend and immediately takes the form of a permit, effectively the opposite side of the consequences of this failure.</seg>
<seg id="14">But most striking is that none of the components гневного faces is not arbitrary, they are one and the same, "said anthropologist John Туби.</seg>
