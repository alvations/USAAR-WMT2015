<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have offered the bill, which is protected by the unions as a civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Where unions, jobs and the middle class," says Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, who is the co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive factions.</seg>
<seg id="4">That's why I proudly represent Act expanding workers ’ rights, together with the symbol of the movement for civil rights by John Lewis.</seg>
<seg id="5">This bill will give workers the same opportunities for legal discrimination against organizations that unions and other forms of discrimination, opponents of trade union power</seg>
<seg id="6">Changing the law on regulation of labour relations in such a way as to allow the workers encountering discrimination for participation in trade union organizations, to seek justice in the civil courts "and to receive compensation for damages and punitive payments - a sensible and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it's certainly not radical initiative - at least by American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the best way to understand the fact that offer Ellison, Lewis and co-authors of the bill, "recall is a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the attacks, which the unions have been subjected in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country, Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, to expand and to respect human rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time, which is still remembered by millions of Americans, when this country simultaneously defend democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas MacArthur and his assistants have helped the country to adopt a constitution, so as to ensure that balanced state autocracy Хидеки Тодзё was replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included text that explicitly admitted that "the right of workers to organize and to negotiate, and for collective action is guaranteed."</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Эйзенхауер and his assistants have helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that the fascism of Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recognizing that workers will need to be organized and be heard in the new state, the Germans have included an article that openly stated: "Right to form associations with the aim to protect and improve employment and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict or seek to diminish that right, will have no legal force; measures to these objectives will be deemed illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">When former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was president of the International Commission on Human Rights, which was World Declaration on Human Rights, which in 1948, will be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the added that "everyone has the right to organize and join unions to protect their interests."</seg>
<seg id="17">Generations of Americans take for granted our basic position that labor rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country was advised by other countries about how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans have explained that the right to organize labor unions - and the fact that this union has participated as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - should be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now, when these rights are under assault in America, wise, indeed, return to the American ideal of what working people should have the right to organize and to ensure that their voices were heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:</seg>
<seg id="21">History is a great teacher.</seg>

<seg id="23">Raising the living standards of millions, unions miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to fragile level of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack the unions, forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.</seg>
<seg id="25">History remembers should and to us.</seg>
<seg id="26">Official recognition of labour rights as human rights and the protection of civil rights, to prevent discrimination against organizations, trade unions, was long overdue.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the U.S., a federal judge on Sunday temporarily has blocked the enactment of the law in Louisiana, which his supporters say he likely will close all five абортных clinics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to this measure, which was signed by the Governor of Louisiana Bobby Джинадлом in June and was supposed to go into effect September 1, doctors who do abortions, were obliged to have showing a radius of 30 miles of their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nevertheless, the judge's decision means that, at present, doctors can continue to make legal abortion, while continuing to seek such powers.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally, continuing actions to gain power," he wrote in his decision, Judge John деГрэвеллз.</seg>
<seg id="6">A hearing will be scheduled within the next month, at which a judge will take a more permanent solution on this law.</seg>
<seg id="7">Advocates for abortion rights decision was met with joy, the last in a chain of decisions against similar measures, saying it will give doctors more time to receive hospital authority.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today's decision ensures that the women will be protected from one Louisiana law, which seeks to deprive them of the health and human rights," said Nancy Нортап, president and head of the Center for reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the state's five clinics.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the decision to the doctors from two clinics that do not give claimants in the case, and also filed an application for the admission.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of the 11 states that have adopted similar laws, and the courts recently acknowledged such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="11">Key parts of texas law, which would have shut most of the remaining clinics in this state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fighters for the right to abortion, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association say that laws about the credentials of doctors to impose restrictions that are not necessary from the medical point of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, though some also pointed to positive effect in the closing clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only one doctor who does abortions in Louisiana, there are powers of the reception in the hospital, according to the Center for reproductive Rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all the other doctors in the state will be forced to stop performing the procedure, the doctor, fearing for their safety, would no longer perform this procedure, the group said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Criticizing the decision, officials in Louisiana said that will not punish doctors doing abortions as long as their statements on the reception awaiting decisions.</seg>

<seg id="1">What will the introduction of quotas for domestic products</seg>
<seg id="2">Not less than half of products for each type of product in the range trading networks should be the Russian production, says Duma deputy from the Just Russia faction Oleg Nilov has informed about.</seg>
<seg id="3">The MP has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures for domestic manufacturers, writes the newspaper Izvestia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The document will still have to avoid possible discomfort детализироваться for buyers.</seg>
<seg id="5">This applies to goods that are produced in Russia. <... > According to the rest of the groups of products, which are produced in Russia, would provide the at least half of their shelves to domestic producers, "Nilov has informed about publication.</seg>
<seg id="6">Together with the amendments, in the article "On the basis of state regulation of trading activities in the Russian Federation," the bill provides for the introduction of changes to the Tax Code, laying down a 10 per cent rate of VAT on religious freedom in the product produced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea to introduce a 50% quota in -процентную trade networks included in the stimulus package for Russian producers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The shop appears several times more than domestic goods.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the initiative may have both positive and negative effects, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the company's lawyer "Налоговик", a member of an independent expert center "Public Duma Sergei Litvinenko for the Russian economy, as well as for domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive in nature, and will lead to growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">The advantage will be key, farmers, and small shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">They will be able to sell more, and that means that profits will grow.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, they will receive the right to dictate their terms to retailers and prices, because they will be forced to buy their goods.</seg>
<seg id="14">Russian manufacturers will be able to increase their business and sales, which would lead to pay higher taxes than before.</seg>
<seg id="15">It will increase revenue, create new jobs, any industry will grow any faster would be brought in, the contribution to GDP growth.</seg>
<seg id="16">Russia's dependence on foreign food fall several times, though not immediately, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="17">Earlier, Russian companies are often unable to fight their way to the shelves of local stores due to higher competition from foreign counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche freed and can breathe a sigh of relief.</seg>
<seg id="19">But do not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary inspections to the Russian market will come grocery goods from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="20">In other words, it is now a "moment of calm" when former players have already gone, but new ones yet to come.</seg>
<seg id="21">Almost a month later, you can talk about four demand for Russian raw materials, as well as rising prices for finished products, "said АиФ.ru first Vice President of Russian public institutions," the Russian club finance directors', Tamara Kasyanov.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clearly, the idea of selling in each category at least 50 per cent of Russian food products will help to consolidate the sector for local producers.</seg>
<seg id="23">In that case, they will have to compete with one another, not with products that subsidies at the expense of another state, are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="24">In other words, the fight for customers will unfold between companies in the same industry.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, says Kasyanov, Russian producers are able to meet 50% of domestic needs compatriots not on all items.</seg>
<seg id="26">And in this situation commercial networks would have to "share" дотягивать Russian goods up to half of the range.</seg>
<seg id="27">In connection with this increase concerns that substandard goods on the shelves).</seg>
<seg id="28">Perhaps under the guise of produced in Russia will be supplied with labels перебитыми foreign products, "adds an expert.</seg>
<seg id="29">The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will feel the large retail chains, especially those that выгодней cooperate with importers.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is logical that the former prime minister will suffer and foreign suppliers, because the demand for their products will decrease.</seg>
<seg id="31">Litvinenko did not rule out that the law on quotas on domestic goods may impact on consumers.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fact is that some of the Russian-made products can yield quality imported ones, while shops will be boosting prices on the second as a scarce commodity.</seg>
<seg id="33">The long-forgotten early in the 2000s, the idea of import substitution economists started talking again in February this year because of the ongoing devaluation of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="34">Now, amid the uneasy relations with the West, the question of refusal to the import of products becomes even more urgent.</seg>
<seg id="35">The law aims to compel retailers to suppliers under orders from domestic producers.</seg>
<seg id="36">Then we go much faster and more confident on the path of import substitution, and the planning system of production on necessary types of products will be created in a shorter period of time, "says the MP Oleg Nilov has informed about.</seg>
<seg id="37">Especially effective mechanism be quotas for the agricultural sector, where the potential is particularly high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.</seg>
<seg id="38">Our farmers are able to fully cover the shelves in Russian shops.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition, a powerful impulse can receive and a beautiful production.</seg>
<seg id="40">As you know, the biggest share of imports remains on offer - from 30% to 35%.</seg>

<seg id="2">Whether Russians feel a sharp increase in prices</seg>
<seg id="3">As a result of Western sanctions and BNP inflation in Russia and not in forecasts уложится leftists, authorities believe, "VTB Capital analysts."</seg>
<seg id="4">According to experts, the deferred effects антисанкций will lead to inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the latest forecast, inflation in 2014 will be 6,5-7,5% next year and even less - 6.5%.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to the newspaper, "Kommersant," the commentary this week should make a "small but significant" changes in macroeconomic forecast up to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the publication, the agency ’ s assessment of inflation in 2015, which will eliminate progeSOFT expected revenue growth of the population.</seg>
<seg id="8">The forecast anticipated that the food sanctions apply a year - until August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">In such a situation, you could assume such high inflation?</seg>
<seg id="10">The current situation is a shock, but geared понижательный trend of inflation does not change, "said the source of the newspaper so far.</seg>
<seg id="11">Economists from VTB Capital "is not shared by the bloc's financial and economic expectations regarding inflation and the forecast price growth in 2014 at the level of 8%.</seg>
<seg id="12">The main effect of product bans will come together with the possible introduction of the Spine sales taxes (GAP) in 2015, experts believe.</seg>
<seg id="13">Inflationary spike in 9% in February, after which the annual pace of price growth will decline, some experts believe.</seg>
<seg id="14">Incidentally, last week, Rosstat concluded the first inflation results, after Russia imposed a "neat sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="15">АиФ.ru interviewed experts and found their inflationary expectations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Artem Деев, head of research at FC AForex:</seg>
<seg id="17">Prices have already observed in key segments.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moreover, when I began to appreciate the socially relevant products, the government has been forced to launch measures to monitor systemic risks to price stability, in order to prevent unreasonable price increases in the short term.</seg>
<seg id="19">Suppliers and retailers already report on a daily basis before regulators that authorities knew exactly who, where and for what reason will trigger an increase in prices.</seg>
<seg id="20">Key factors for the growth of the consumer price index continues to be tremendous pace of capital flight, and the excessive refinancing the banking sector from the Russian мегарегулятора, internal convert because of the flight of foreign currency, as well as an embargo on the import of food products from the countries that joined the sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="21">If inflationary pressures remained under control, the cost of a minimum basket of food has not jumped to 12 per cent in just one quarter.</seg>
<seg id="22">A ban on the import of food products provoked shock proposals on the internal market and led to the utterly логичному ultimate value increases.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because at this stage we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, and increase the size of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production, retaliatory sanctions continue to bear the risks of inflationary growth.</seg>
<seg id="24">If you add another here and fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as ухудшенными prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year, inflation could exceed 8%.</seg>
<seg id="25">Alexander Разуваев, director of the analytical department "Alpari."</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 1990s, inflation sometimes hit 20-30% per month to zero, it was also higher than current levels, another thing that then it is offset by rapid economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="27">I think, at the end of the year inflation will be 8-8,5%.</seg>
<seg id="28">Plato Магута, managing assets of the Fund Магута "</seg>
<seg id="29">An external factor associated with sanctions against Russia, while successfully contained, but if there is a further increase of the pressure, first and foremost, for the financial sector - this can lead to certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations, which usually manifest themselves in traditionally purchases cash currency to protect their savings.</seg>
<seg id="30">It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance will try to smooth the weakening rouble, as well as market-based methods and government regulation.</seg>
<seg id="31">But prices traditionally begins after the summer lull, and perhaps this fall will become more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="32">The target level of consumer inflation in Russia at 7.5%, most likely выстоит, as Russia has another financial savings.</seg>

<seg id="15">"As far as the proposed settlements for the constructive elements, but in practice this is implementable, because the building has often used different technologies," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is no secret that is largely thanks to стройрынок госзаказу.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the Chairman of the Management Board of the NP "Экспертное community professionals procurement" Catherine Лезиной, today, the state is the most effective customer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Deputy director of the pharmaceutical industry ’ s centre of capital construction Vladimir Malakhov drew attention to the fact that today's market is nominally divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and the company that owns outsourced competence and does not allow for this field of competitors.</seg>
<seg id="19">He believes that the creation of a transparent market is only possible when access to contracts that Turkey would be the maximum impact from someone's manager.</seg>
<seg id="20">The expert council was asked to form a government in such a way that one and the same performer may not receive more than one contract worth more than $1 billion rubles, or several contracts worth more than $1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="21">In минстрое believe that this approach must be evaluated from the point of view of the business impact, and effectiveness of construction management.</seg>
<seg id="22">As explained by Elena Zhukova, in this case, you will need to delegate the function of general contractor that will lead to an increase in the number of customer and budgetary expenditure on its content.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the same time, the customer will need to have the knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by contractors, as well as their safety.</seg>
<seg id="24">Often, in this 1.13 will need to determine who will be responsible for the security of an object as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of qualified participants in connection with the state in obtaining state drogerie order for part-time work and a small amount of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="26">Deputy head Alexander Евсташенков procurement экспертно-консультационного Center Institute, believes that the government has now turned into a business to Scor contractor.</seg>
<seg id="27">And this example: "A participant when completing the application must indicate" specific performance "without specifying the words" or equivalent "," should "," "," "more," "less than," "similar" "or", "type", "a similar type," "lower," "lower," "higher," "can," "may," "might," "earlier" and "not previously," "higher," "not allowed" and so on.</seg>
<seg id="28">Thus, customers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of applications of contractors.</seg>
<seg id="29">Another problem, according to 44-ФЗ Евсташенкова, was the need to assess the application of quality of work through the "paper" proposal.</seg>
<seg id="30">Looking at a proposal that actually can be assessed only qualified contractors, but not the quality of the work, in which not even began, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="31">The quality of the works can be assessed only on their acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="32">The expert council also was asked to take a margin income from the upper echelon to have disappeared in the lower intermediate contractors.</seg>
<seg id="33">Chairman of the Expert Council, State Secretary, espionage FAS Andrew Цариковский believes that it should not, as responsible for the order should генподрядчик.</seg>
<seg id="34">But otherwise, as in the famous репризе Arkady Raikin normalises sleeping: "Пуговицам claims to have?"</seg>

<seg id="2">In the former home of gold and горнозаводчиков Евдокима Демидова Ivan and his son on the street of the October Revolution 57 / 1 (former Big Kazan) 18 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the 18th century house built virtually unchanged, except ветхость.</seg>
<seg id="4">People here go, on excursion, and residents are more than delighted, from his privilege - the right to live in the house, the walls of which Ufa 7th remember commander Alexander Suvorov.</seg>
<seg id="5">Date buildings house amongst others, historians point to the two dates - 1730 and 1737 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in any case, it turns out that the nearly 300 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The old yard, always open the door, squeaky staircase.</seg>
<seg id="8">Doors in the apartments are located near each other, chair covers were cracked, walls and peeling plaster просветы places visible from the street.</seg>
<seg id="9">It seems that everything rests on honest word.</seg>
<seg id="10">But local residents are told: "You don't think it is."</seg>
<seg id="11">Live in a wooden house in the 18th century is very difficult, "says Tatiana (1961, a resident of apartment # 3.</seg>
<seg id="12">The object is on госохране, but its contents are not allocated the money for dozens of years, and we feel museum artifacts, about whom the authorities simply forgot.</seg>
<seg id="13">The last renovation was 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The wall is still performing well, though with great difficulties, but the foundation of the entire прогнил.</seg>
<seg id="15">Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, and higher once a week in a public bath.</seg>
<seg id="16">How can we be satisfied in such conditions?</seg>
<seg id="17">The road passes directly under the windows, even a pedestrian zone.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tatiana will put off behind.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now see what before was only heard: Under the windows of the cars stream rushes.</seg>
<seg id="20">You see, glass дребезжат constantly, can't open a window, and got used to the noise.</seg>
<seg id="21">A man awaits the outcome, for good and bad.</seg>
<seg id="22">Our apartment is still a top, thanks to her husband, hands him gold.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, we have two rooms, three of them live with her son.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for other families, the conditions are much worse at ceilings on the second floor of a little more than one and a half metres tall.</seg>
<seg id="25">In contrast to Tatiana offers guests the roommate out of the apartment, No. 6 Lyudmila Старостиной.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nice friendly woman with threshold offers up a cup of coffee and with a sad smile said:</seg>
<seg id="27">We have a one-bedroom apartment, 14.5 m ² for four people, and we live with her husband and daughter with his granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="28">I am here with the birth, another boundary has never been seen before, "Lyudmila обводит eyes room: You're buying two couch the letter" g "; one of them was the granddaughter with a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="29">Very closely and differs little from a domestic interior: Only beautiful ceilings, "historical."</seg>
<seg id="30">But with ceiling tap system regularly flows: Good.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lyudmila said about his apartment and amazing at the same time, simply as an Italian house, which stands on the Roman ruins.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is the one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:</seg>
<seg id="33">Water spent about 40 years ago during the last repair.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the same time we have a tiny kitchen and bathroom in закутке from former чулана.</seg>
<seg id="35">We live in a time where квартировал Demidov, the family lived on the second floor of a servant.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our apartment is privatized, and why?</seg>
<seg id="37">The median real estate, the privatization say it does not matter.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still get only a one-bedroom apartment can't apply for more.</seg>
<seg id="39">Already four months ago promised us расселить, but promises it won't matter.</seg>
<seg id="40">Not used to complain and I will not.</seg>
<seg id="41">In this apartment (bedroom!) lived for an entire dynasty: My grandparents, mum and dad, I'm with my husband and my daughter with his granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="42">Things happened during that time.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, здоровенные rats ran in the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="44">Look at the walls, they one-meter wide thickness.</seg>
<seg id="45">They say that a solution was involved in eggs, so long rests.</seg>
<seg id="46">House built thoroughly Демидовым, thank you!</seg>
<seg id="47">Perhaps, but so far no one killed or сваей crumbling ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="48">Only construction still slowly dying in front of us: Boards and log house гниют, floors have repeatedly failed, pouring cement, but all of it - the solution goes into the ground, as well.</seg>
<seg id="49">They say, and is under our bathroom the concealed лаз and move to the river White, who had once lived here, there had to be protected from the danger, in which case.</seg>
<seg id="50">They also pursued.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lyudmila Starostina said, came to him as a historian, he begged, he began to shoot in the flat excavations.</seg>
<seg id="52">And then urged to give them housing space in exchange for its однушку in October.</seg>
<seg id="53">Lyudmila historian refused:</seg>
<seg id="54">Where are we in daily однушку?</seg>
<seg id="55">But here at least a tiny hope is that will give housing more spacious.</seg>
<seg id="56">We agree on the exchange, would not have won.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, the family Старостиных won nothing.</seg>
<seg id="58">The biggest dream that their расселили Lyudmila, and daughter gave his granddaughter of one 16-year-old from a separate room.</seg>
<seg id="59">Then there are the two families have identified two-room apartment instead of the majestic ruins, in which two generations living now.</seg>
<seg id="60">Pretty, Olesya Карсакова миниатюрная girl from flats No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.</seg>
<seg id="61">There squeezed in two cramped (23 m ², called apartments, lives with her large family.</seg>
<seg id="62">Altogether seven people, two of them children.</seg>
<seg id="63">See for yourself what conditions.</seg>
<seg id="64">Butt falls off pieces of plaster and window frames, the walls in the kitchen, and the cross-cutting holes.</seg>
<seg id="65">The water in the кране only cold year round.</seg>
<seg id="66">Walking about the apartments in the old house, so you can be sure that the most fortunate of spouses Лаврентьевым apartment No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="67">They occupy the most spacious rooms of the first floor.</seg>
<seg id="68">You are right, a lot of places.</seg>
<seg id="69">In the 75 square, directed three people.</seg>
<seg id="70">We live in those rooms, where legend has it stopped police during his stay in Ufa, the head of the family, "said Aleksandr Dmitrievich Lavrentyev.</seg>
<seg id="71">High ceilings, spacious.</seg>
<seg id="72">One bad - all around the train wreck that is collapsing, falling apart.</seg>
<seg id="73">Neighbors probably already told.</seg>
<seg id="74">The more suffering we have with floors, wooden planks, сгнили literally walked the earth from beneath your feet.</seg>
<seg id="75">I put подпорки, wedges, in the hall, and yet nothing, go to another room on a seesaw качаемся, so all you can.</seg>
<seg id="76">The house merchant Евдокима Демидова Aleksandr Dmitrievich can tell you better than any guide.</seg>
<seg id="77">The золотопромышленнику refers to the native, speaks of it with admiration.</seg>
<seg id="78">Indeed, the personality and the owner was fantastic: Кагинского Узянского plants built houses, bells and cannons отливал, kept Ural mines.</seg>
<seg id="79">The heirs of the estate, but merchants take pride in an ancestor to live under one roof with history no longer want.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am settled here, even as a child, in the 1940s, of the 20th century, "said Aleksandr Dmitrievich.</seg>
<seg id="81">Then around stood wooden buildings and a barn and sentry boxes, subsequently снесенные.</seg>
<seg id="82">In 1968, wanted to remove, and our home, but something prevented.</seg>
<seg id="83">The same story was repeated again in 2014: Поманили new housing.</seg>
<seg id="84">We, as a team, gathered all the necessary court documents обегали, and suddenly learned that moving to an apartment in 2015 or 2016.</seg>
<seg id="85">Something already doesn't believe in all this.</seg>
<seg id="86">Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan, to learn the fate of their homes.</seg>
<seg id="87">Officials of the occupier was not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="88">Sent from one desk to another, but then, as mockery, given the paper without the signature and seal: "The Ministry of Culture is not objecting to resettlement tenants."</seg>
<seg id="89">Even though I have a feeling that our house has long been not in terms of the city since he first was at number 57, then became 57 A, now 57 / 1.</seg>
<seg id="90">As if he had been demolished in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="91">"A planet" turned to the head of the management sector informational-analytical Ufa Vladimir Барабашу Land Resources.</seg>
<seg id="92">A house on the street of the October Revolution 57 / 1 is included in the resettlement of old housing.</seg>
<seg id="93">I cannot answer for the actions of the officials in the 1970s, only know that at the time there was a plan for demolition of old homes, despite the historical significance.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the authorities is to rebuild the old house on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value, is successfully implemented.</seg>
<seg id="95">Tenants soon planned расселить on new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="96">According to Барабаша, restore House Демидова are Italian specialists who have participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="97">Now in Italy, and the project is architectural Biennale "Old Ufa" presented there, among others.</seg>
<seg id="98">I hope that by 2016 all former Old Street telephone will be short, "said the official.</seg>
<seg id="99">Purchase order, the home, which was used to, three centuries ago.</seg>
<seg id="100">House Демидова, is likely to become a museum, open to all comers.</seg>
<seg id="101">In addition, the government decided to do on weekends, a pedestrian street.</seg>
<seg id="102">On weekdays, unfortunately, does not work, is too much workload roads in the city.</seg>
<seg id="103">People from the future museum расселить Vladimir Barabas promises in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="104">However, it is unlikely they will be: Their new apartments will be of the same area, and that the current.</seg>
<seg id="105">Only from another era.</seg>

<seg id="2">Never say, "I love you"</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was one of seven children born to a family of immigrants from Jamaica in Dudley in Мидлендс in 1958.</seg>
<seg id="4">His father, who died when Henry was 19, he worked in a factory, and their relationship has been limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry репетирует comedy, "Rare records Rudi," which is partially based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of programmes on Radio 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mix of 199.4 and rap, and melodies - жизнерадостны.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Henry had to wading through some difficult memories of childhood.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the death of his mother was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often mused about the relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was very inaccessible.</seg>
<seg id="10">You never saw his face, you've only heard his voice: "Don't make noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Отстань dated sisters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Шевелись!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch the cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were older, when I was a child, walked with him in the pub and talk about these things, as a form of beer glasses, the beauty of the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">I have never talked with him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was such a неулыбчивым guy in the corner, reading a newspaper which is a big part of my life.</seg>
<seg id="17">Henry recently opened the studio are in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in the days of his father, he was able to take a look at what must have been his life.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now there's a little bit better, but it's dark, дымные labyrinths' full extent, depth of Tartary with outbreaks of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father залезал in a bathtub and just lay there, and you have heard, as he slowly begins to sing about himself, because he wanted the отмыться mould workshop.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I came back, I realised that he was doing this for years and years, to earn money for food, and I began to appreciate it more.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nevertheless, Henry came from a childhood devoid of parental love.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never cuddled, never said, "I love you."</seg>
<seg id="23">Only when her mother became ill at the very end of her life, we started to talk: "I love you, I love you, I love you.</seg>
<seg id="24">The birth of her own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love with which he lacked as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">You can stop it, "I love you"?</seg>
<seg id="26">Just don't hug me!</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I'm 22!</seg>
<seg id="28">With Dawn French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why would I not be friends with her?</seg>
<seg id="30">She's a great mother</seg>
<seg id="31">They are still great friends with the French, to whom he was married for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="32">Don is a good man.</seg>

<seg id="34">She's a great mom.</seg>
<seg id="35">Henry was the mother of the diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="36">He was the one that killed her.</seg>
<seg id="37">So, when I was very, very recovered and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take drastic measures.</seg>
<seg id="38">Then I began serious training фитенсом, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It's very hard.</seg>
<seg id="40">And that's boring.</seg>
<seg id="41">Nobody eats carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">A change of career trajectories of Henry reflected, perhaps, in his noble, briefly подстриженной beard.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he received the recognition of critics for his Othello, he completely immersed in theatre.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Комедия errors followed," and then "hotel" Огаста Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">This work is different from sitcoms and comedies that were неотъемлимым attribute his busy professional life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He started his career, when he was 16 and worked in a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">DJ noticed how he parodies on the stage, and wrote about it in "The new faces."</seg>
<seg id="48">His career in television began in the mid seventies: "Quite a long time I was the only black пародистом / first on television."</seg>
<seg id="49">He was learning on the job.</seg>
<seg id="50">I not only had to grow in the eyes of the public, I had to learn how to be an effective vehicle for delivering jokes between 1975 and 1985, as a star, working on television, and it was very hard.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny in the 'New faces "in 1975</seg>
<seg id="52">As his manager had to show "Black and white minstrels," light entertainment program, in which people "чернили themselves face," Henry found that acting in it for five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">My family is a very disliked.</seg>
<seg id="54">I'm, like, hopefully, this will never be with me, but I don't regret that I did it.</seg>
<seg id="55">Although it was strange, worthy of condemnation position, I worked on large venues and learned to work with a crowd.</seg>
<seg id="56">But what was the "light entertainment awards given to British television classics for years and years," and "it was grotesque to black people."</seg>

<seg id="58">The first season of "Show Lenny Henry" was broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as, among other things, the chef Гэрет Блэклок from the comedy series "Biased!."</seg>
<seg id="59">Commercials, documentaries, television series and roles in films took the following ten years of his life, but after his putt on the BBC in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "what are you going to do next, Len, because it seems that you little тянешь time or quietly сворачиваешь aside."</seg>
<seg id="60">Next was a series of documentary broadcasts on Radio 4 called "What's good for...?"</seg>

<seg id="62">I was a genuine allergy to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">We cannot say to me adequately taught this at school, and I thought that it was, in many ways, the prerogative of white people with middle-class колготками and cabbage downstairs in front.</seg>

<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">It seemed that they were waiting for a disaster, but it has not happened.</seg>
<seg id="75">Soon we began "Комедию mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I was at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you have changed."</seg>
<seg id="78">The technical problem arose, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the audience.</seg>
<seg id="79">"The Pacific voice inside me said: 'You have to work 10 minutes until they чинят computer.'"</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead, assistant director announced that view will resume as soon as the problem will be solved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I walked away from the scene and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."</seg>
<seg id="82">It's not my responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can't let someone else deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="84">"You're playing in, stay in the role."</seg>

<seg id="93">By the way, Henry is still thinking comic - all the way our conversation перебивают flashes his humor, when he then starts, it finishes to parody.</seg>
<seg id="94">I just decided not to work in стендапе, because this thing with instant gratification from a room full of strangers, I think, quite dangerous.</seg>

<seg id="3">But sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, hard to communicate, tense, and maybe a little раздражительный.</seg>
<seg id="4">And then she пожимала his hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">He saw in his irritability.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was колючим like hair, yes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The last victim of this колючести was little novel, from which he waited longer than usual, lonely and boring life, and perhaps even some satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Эйлинн Соломонз was pulsating with beautiful hair and fragile взлохмаченными трепещущим heart of northern island village, even more remote and harsh than Port Ройбен.</seg>
<seg id="9">She came to the south with the master over themselves, which Кеверн believed her aunt, while the latter has inherited a house in crude, but like Paradise Valley under the name "joyous Райская Valley."</seg>
<seg id="10">No one lived in the house for several years.</seg>
<seg id="11">In defence, trickling pipes sat motionless, spiders слизни left their footprints on all the windows, confident that the house belongs to them; garden зарос weeds like giant кочаны cabbage.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was like a cottage from children ’ s books, simultaneously frightening and enchanting, with a garden full of secrets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Opinion of the author: Howard Джейкобсон, whose novel "J" included лонг-лист Букеровской premiums in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">The shortlist will be announced next week</seg>
<seg id="15">And Кеверн Эйлинн sat, holding hands, in a broken industry among the high grass, enjoying surprisingly warm spring day; they both absentmindedly to cheap consoles, which provided with country music and appeasing 3-zmianowy news, when, glancing at her brown crossed his legs, and he remembered the old song long forgotten black performer, whom he loved listening to his father, the curtains in the house.</seg>
<seg id="16">You've got big feet too.</seg>
<seg id="17">In view of the inherent aggressiveness, the type of songs to the console, no longer lost.</seg>
<seg id="18">They were not banned - nothing actually was not forbidden, just more of them is not lost.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have become, as the word "архаичными archaic."</seg>
<seg id="20">Public taste did what would never have succeeded in orders and regulations, and in the same way as rich people chose among books of memoirs, staying in poverty, cookbooks and love the novels, of all the music they chose ballads.</seg>
<seg id="21">This happens during the day, Кеверн began playing the piano and ideation gross comic voice singing great legs Эйлинн.</seg>
<seg id="22">Эйлинн not understood.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It was a popular if jazz pianist named Фэтс Уоллер", he told her, automatically placing two fingers to his lips.</seg>
<seg id="24">So did his father to stop the letter "J" before she power immediately from his lips.</seg>
<seg id="25">It started with the game, in which they played when he was little.</seg>
<seg id="26">His father played in it with his father, as he told him.</seg>
<seg id="27">Start with "J" word, put two fingers to his mouth, "and it will cost you a penny.</seg>
<seg id="28">It was not very fun back then, and it was not very fun right now.</seg>
<seg id="29">He knew that from him, wait, that's all.</seg>
<seg id="30">He had to explain what is jazz.</seg>
<seg id="31">Эйлинн never heard.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jazz is playing, even though he was not explicitly prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="33">Improvisation went out of fashion.</seg>
<seg id="34">In life, there was only one "if."</seg>
<seg id="35">When the music started, people wanted to know exactly where it will end.</seg>
<seg id="36">With the same wit.</seg>
<seg id="37">His unpredictability had acted on people's nerves.</seg>
<seg id="38">But jazz was wit, marked with the help of music.</seg>
<seg id="39">Although he has reached the age of 10 years, never слышав about Sammy Дэвисе Младшем, Кеверн knew about jazz from paternal полусекретной коллеции CDs.</seg>
<seg id="40">But at least he did not have to speak Эйлинн that Фэтс Уоллер was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">Given her age, it is unlikely she remembered a time when popular singers were not black.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again, there are no laws or pressure.</seg>
<seg id="43">Society was docile, and this meant that every segment of the agreed with gratitude - the gratitude of those spared the fate, "with the principle of group predispositions.</seg>
<seg id="44">People афро-карибского origin in temperament and physical characteristics are suitable for areas of entertainment and sport - and they were singing and ran.</seg>

<seg id="48">Each according to his abilities.</seg>
<seg id="49">As she had heard only Эйлинн ballads, it was hard to understand how offensive the word, who had just sung her Кеверн, could be laid on music.</seg>
<seg id="50">Music is an expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">"They didn't really offensive," said Кеверн.</seg>
<seg id="52">Except, maybe, for people who have great legs.</seg>
<seg id="53">My father never offended anybody, but he loved this song.</seg>
<seg id="54">He said too much, but launched a garden gave him the illusion of security.</seg>
<seg id="55">No word could not penetrate the US giant leaves similar to капустные.</seg>
<seg id="56">Эйлинн still did not understand.</seg>
<seg id="57">Like your father could love this?</seg>
<seg id="58">He wanted to say that it was a joke, but he didn't want to if it eases up two fingers to his lips again.</seg>
<seg id="59">And so she had thought it strange.</seg>

<seg id="62">There was nothing in the whole world, in addition to its копны иссиня-черных hair.</seg>
<seg id="63">Nothing, that he would like to watch.</seg>
<seg id="64">"Well, if you say so," she said, in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="65">But this still does not explain why you sing it to me.</seg>
<seg id="66">She seemed really upset.</seg>
<seg id="67">I have too big feet?</seg>
<seg id="68">He looked at them again.</seg>
<seg id="69">You cannot say no.</seg>

<seg id="74">It's just this stupid song.</seg>
<seg id="75">He could say: "I love you," but it was too early.</seg>
<seg id="76">"I like you very much because you have thick ankles", tried to say he instead.</seg>
<seg id="77">I have such a distortion.</seg>
<seg id="78">It was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="79">He wanted me to this was ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="80">Attempts joke frequently made him awkward situation, because, like his father, he was missing the soothing charm that could mitigate the cruelty, крывшуюся in whole or in part.</seg>
<seg id="81">Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.</seg>
<seg id="82">Maybe he, Кеверн, wanted.</seg>
<seg id="83">Despite the good eye.</seg>
<seg id="84">Эйлинн Соломонз flushed and stood up with the oldies lounger, and the wine that they drank.</seg>
<seg id="85">Wine from the referendum, so that drugs could not serve as his excuse.</seg>
<seg id="86">In his excitement, it seemed that she was trembling, like living beings leaves in the weather system.</seg>
<seg id="87">"And you, I like you very much because you have a pointless head," she said.</seg>
<seg id="88">Though not like you very much.</seg>
<seg id="89">He felt sorry for her and because of the excessive brutality of his words, and because of fear, who appeared in her eyes when she gave it to him.</seg>
<seg id="90">Whether she thought that he hit her?</seg>
<seg id="91">She has not talked to him about life on the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he has no doubt that she was in basic traits like здешнюю.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same huge icy ocean struck on both of them.</seg>
<seg id="93">Those same American pilots could reflect with men, even more sensitive and accused after THAT happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened than their ancestors, and the smugglers разрушители, shopped in fury from pub to pub, ready to raise a hand on any woman, or to deny them посмевшую поддразнить them.</seg>
<seg id="94">Pointless head?</seg>
<seg id="95">They would have shown her a fist, if she was not cautious.</seg>
<seg id="96">Would be first kissed, kiss now became the most common erotic expression of irritation between a man and a woman; an antidote from fresh ballads, too, which provide proper console - first kiss her, and then hit.</seg>
<seg id="97">Excessive clarification, according to Кеверна because the kiss itself was already хулиганством.</seg>
<seg id="98">Эйлинн Соломонз case showed that he needs to leave.</seg>
<seg id="99">He rose from the lounger, like an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She herself felt the lead weight, but the weight of his grief surprised her.</seg>
<seg id="101">This was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They barely knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">She looked, as he goes, and out of an upper window looked, as he leaves, her companion, the man himself to endure взваливший.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam, outgoing garden, she thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">She felt a stab of sympathy towards him and men in general, even though some of them and raised her hand.</seg>
<seg id="106">The man, from the pulpit, отвернувшийся behind пристыженный, slain, the ability to fight left him - why she felt she knew so well, if she could not recall a single occasion, until today, when she saw this?</seg>
<seg id="107">Again one Эйлинн Соломонз looked at their feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">For twenty years prior to the above events or so Esme cantered Нуссбаум, intelligent and energetic 32-летняя исследовательница who worked in "Офнау", an informal service control over Community mood, has prepared a report on the low and medium levels of violence in most parts of the country, where it was expected that it will be reduced, if not over entirely, given the means and the forces that were allocated to its eradication.</seg>
<seg id="109">"A lot has been done, and a lot is being done," she wrote, "to ease the innate aggressiveness of people who fought in a war and won most of them, especially among these спутанных branches and narrow расселин area, where, despite изгородями spires of churches above Centigrade, gentle breath of human kindness was rarely in history.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, some quality, it turns out, неискоренимы.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher the spire, it would seem, the низменнее those passions that he зарождает.</seg>
<seg id="112">The population of sheds tears over the sentimental stories of drinking, skipping преодоленных obstacles and announces its overheated belief in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness retains its strong grip as in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is evidence that a new depth and vile задиристость in homes, in the workplace, on roads and even in playgrounds.</seg>
<seg id="113">"You have досадная habit of writing too much," said her supervisor, having read the report as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="114">It seems to me that you should read shorter novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">Esme cantered Нуссбаум lowered his head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask you: You атеистка?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I think that is not obliged to answer," said Esme cantered Нуссбаум.</seg>
<seg id="118">Are you gay?</seg>
<seg id="119">Esme cantered again insisted on his right to privacy and silence.</seg>
<seg id="120">Feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Again, silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I ask," said Luther Рабиновиц finally, "not because I am against atheism, лесбийства or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">Here we have no prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="124">We are the servants of society without prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="125">But some kinds of hypersensitivity, absolutely reasonable and a good in themselves, they may sometimes distort the results, such as those that you have shown me.</seg>
<seg id="126">It is obvious that you yourself предубеждены against the church, and what you call "malevolent" and "rude", others would be interpreted as an expression of natural and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="127">Continue the нудеть BUT THAT happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened, as if it happened, if it happened yesterday, it means depriving the country needed her life force.</seg>
<seg id="128">Esme cantered Нуссбаум огляделась on both sides until Рабиновиц said.</seg>
<seg id="129">Over his head, and pink as gimmicks and LED letters repeated advice that "Офнау" gave the country the last quarter of a century or more.</seg>
<seg id="130">His neighbour, улыбайся value of his spouse, listen to ballads, walk, talk on the phone, organise, talk, listen, объясняй соглашайся, извиняйся.</seg>
<seg id="131">The conversation is better than silence, word of the song better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I fully understand that you want to say," said Esme cantered Нуссбаум quietly, when satisfied that her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I don't want to say anything, except that we're not излечились as efficiently as we convince ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">My concern is that unless we are ready, we will find that repeat mistakes that initially led to ТОМУ ВООБЩЕ IF THAT happened, happened.</seg>
<seg id="134">Only this time we выбросим their anger and distrust the other.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Рабиновиц joined his fingers in a sitting.</seg>
<seg id="136">That gesture was supposed to mean an infinite patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"You go too far," he said, "calling" mistakes "actions that made or not made our grandfathers.</seg>
<seg id="138">You go too far and when talking about what they threw away their "anger" and "mistrust" in the "other."</seg>
<seg id="139">In your place, people should not need since then about the fact that, in the past, it is now, we don't talk about "us" and "them."</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "us" and no "other."</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of turmoil - that's all we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"For which, to be honest with ourselves," ventured into Esme cantered, "neither part of society may well justify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am not accusing anyone.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it's bad or good, what is done is done.</seg>
<seg id="145">Then it was back then.</seg>
<seg id="146">Nothing needs to be said - here we agree.</seg>
<seg id="147">And how not to blame anybody, we should not make excuses and, if that was appropriate, or if it could be something to fix.</seg>
<seg id="148">But why the past, if not to learn "</seg>
<seg id="149">Past Update to ensure that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I can add to that one word -</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther's Great Pyramid Рабиновица fallen apart.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I'll review your report," he said, and dismissed her.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, on the way to work, her knocked мотоциклист, who rode on the sidewalk, passersby, described as "a vicious rage."</seg>

<seg id="2">Output growth in the eurozone slowed to the lowest in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.</seg>
<seg id="3">The business index (PMI) for the eurozone manufacturing sector public fell to 50.7 in August, dropping from 51.8 in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">The value of above 50 indicates growth.</seg>
<seg id="5">New orders, Barbarossa and businesses suffered amid growing tension between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The values were received before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Markets will wait for the bank, a clear plan for how to deal with the eurozone ’ s recovery, as well as the threat of deflation, with inflation of just 0.3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi announced later this week, may give further signals that he is contemplating scheme of quantitative easing in the eurozone, similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Although some growth is better than no growth, braking effect of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on producers are becoming more obvious," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at public.</seg>
<seg id="10">The manufacturing sector PMI in Germany, a major trade partner of Russia in the EU, has fallen to the lowest level in 11 months of 51.4.</seg>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile, in the bloc's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.</seg>

<seg id="13">Signs that growth momentum faded mainly industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also adds to the confidence, "said Mr Dobson.</seg>
<seg id="14">The industry will likely still would add fuel to the fire, analysts anticipating the introduction of additional monetary or tax-based incentives.</seg>
<seg id="15">One positive news was from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.</seg>
<seg id="16">Howard Арчер, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that can be said about the August survey index of business activity in the eurozone manufacturing sector is that it shows that the sector is still growing."</seg>
<seg id="17">He added: "Eurozone manufacturers, obviously, are finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension - particularly associated with the Russia / Ukraine, adds uncertainty still difficult conditions in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">This increasing tension, apparently hit by business - and especially on the confidence of consumers, and is likely to lead to the fact that some orders are delayed, or even cancelled, especially large orders.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said that "more and more it looks like" that the ECB, of course, will have to conduct some kind of quantitative easing, "although we suspect that it will be limited."</seg>

<seg id="82">He is not looking for revenge, for example, he did not just fixed on it in this last nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not like to remember it, but they are very close with six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and burn candles there.</seg>

<seg id="85">Not slept, and his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys. Дамиру now 17, he was above me, nice, smart and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that a few hours I was so sure that he is dead and that I never see more.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I was able to recover from the explosion and rose to his feet, I огляделась, I saw hell around himself when parts of bodies were lying everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely sure that it is not possible to my little boy could survive in this hell.</seg>

<seg id="103">There is not a single day when we won't remember this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="104">We don't think that it was a long time ago, I think it was yesterday, some scenes of these days, I have all the time in front of the eyes.</seg>

<seg id="112">George says now: "It is important that this never happened.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I doubt that we ever learn the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">People continue to investigate this tragedy and will never learn the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">Now they are investigating the collapse of Boeings in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Will we ever know what it was called?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world is going to something very bad.</seg>
<seg id="118">"I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, and nobody wants a war, because it is happening?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing for this pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need to have dozens of years slightly to forget her.</seg>
<seg id="121">It has affected my health, and I still feel it.</seg>
<seg id="122">About three or four years of nightmares because of me, but now it became better.</seg>
<seg id="123">I returned to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.</seg>
<seg id="124">I thought about my friends and get rid of, who were killed.</seg>

<seg id="140">Indeed, it is a miracle that he was not killed.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It seems to us that it was yesterday," says Giorgi, who wanted to study the intelligence officer in the Federal Security Service (FSB), but couldn't because of the damage that was caused by his health during his capture.</seg>
<seg id="142">It's still with me, this is not something that I left behind.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am older now, and they say that children can easily cope with bad events, I must say that this is not true.</seg>

<seg id="157">I studied there for two years.</seg>

<seg id="159">He said: "I know that never will talk to their children about their experiences.</seg>
<seg id="160">It is not what children should know, and, of course, is not what they need to survive.</seg>
<seg id="161">His mother, Marina, 42, said: "The pain never leaves me.</seg>
<seg id="162">She's in my soul, and worse, when the anniversary is approaching.</seg>
<seg id="163">I will go and will attend the ceremonies, which will be held, to celebrate her.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know that George did not go.</seg>
<seg id="165">For him it should be even stronger, because he was there, but I'm not.</seg>
<seg id="166">I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help.</seg>
<seg id="167">I am so grateful to God that he came back to me... Here in Beslan print lies on each.</seg>
<seg id="168">He remains with us.</seg>
<seg id="169">George, now an adult, but the nightmare was still with him.</seg>
<seg id="170">It's hard to take when something so terribly unfair that happens to you.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was a boy, he loves the sport, but he can't do because of the knee.</seg>
<seg id="172">He had several operations, he can walk, but he can't exercise.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say that the 50 per cent he overcame this nightmare, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.</seg>

<seg id="177">My son with me, and this is the best gift that God could I do, but my heart aches for those who had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know the family, where the children were born, but I know and widows who never married.</seg>

<seg id="183">Why are they killing each other?</seg>
<seg id="184">The war is very close to our country right now, and I can hardly believe it.</seg>
<seg id="185">We were a close-knit country in the past, how did it come about that we are fighting now?</seg>
<seg id="186">Men and children are suffering, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine, and many will be killed.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips, how to achieve a better quality of underwater photos and videos</seg>
<seg id="2">If you want to take photos or shoot video under water in front of you a whole range of options.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is waterproof "Point and Shoot," for example, the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or, for example, GoPro Hero3 экшн-камера + Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I took these pictures on a family holiday with the help of several cameras, all for the price of about $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">No matter what equipment you use, the more rules you need to abide by in order to achieve the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Перепроверяйте their equipment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera case and other branches of the tightly closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, set up their camera for the type of photos or videos that you shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some of the photos and video cameras filming or object type is regimes that optimise exposure for mages underwater conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in the water, look at how deep your equipment can fall.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are aimed only at 5 feet, others - 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Look at our leadership and customer ratings digital cameras for both traditional and for November models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Remove a few frames - because many of them don't enclosures.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Have essentially have" increased LCD that can help you, whereas your экшн-камер them usually don't.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have LCD, it will be difficult to see under the water, and the layout of the frame is a random process.</seg>
<seg id="16">So do a few frames.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also, if you have your camera's serial shooting mode, which takes several shots with slightly different plant exhibits, take it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay near the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">The amount of light is significantly reduced, the deeper you нырнете under water.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, stay near the surface, when you're shooting in a swimming pool, a river or ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">It also allows you to transmit more colour in photographs; the deeper you get, the fewer colors you'll see.</seg>
<seg id="22">Подплывайте closer to shooting.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is excellent advice for shooting on the land, but it is even more important under the water because of the mages light conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is especially important if you're shooting on экшн-камеру: This equipment often comes with a fixed, широкоугольной lens, which means that you have to get closer to shooting, if you want to fill the frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was such a man, whose force of personality could shake things around, even in such a giant organization like the National Health Service.</seg>
<seg id="2">Консультирующий anaesthetist, he has devoted his career needs of patients suffering from the disease and the treatment of tattooing.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among those who spoke to him, recalls his wife, was an officer in the M16, who had to live with devastating effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that as long as Dr. passionate about being diagnosed and diseases, those being treated mostly worried about something else -- the pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, however, he appeared to those who suffer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I never felt, as usual," he wrote in May last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I found it hard to find strength in herself.</seg>
<seg id="8">Struggling with symptoms similar to flu, he found that his wife, Джулиет reproaches irritably.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want all happened sooner rather than later," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Джулиет left for a week, Lawson found that unusual and it is unclear why he was upset.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked a colleague to do chest X-rays.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks before he went skiing in the Alps Французских.</seg>
<seg id="14">Results of the X-rays came.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was mesothelioma, a terminal cancer, which affects the lungs, плевру or shell.</seg>
<seg id="16">For most cancers it is difficult to determine an exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although some people succumb to cancer of the lung, for example, not all patients develop lung cancer smoked.</seg>
<seg id="18">But with mesothelioma differently.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases the cause is contact with asbestos, grainy construction material, who once called a "miracle," but which, as we now know, deadly dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us mesothelioma is a disease that you don't pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos, in the end, is the material from the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in the UK since the 1960s, when these industrial ban came into force.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even when it has been used, only people from specific sectors worked in close contact with him: Трубоизолировщики, builders, carpenters and workers of all computers, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">Industrial toxin from another era, he hardly seems cause for concern today.</seg>
<seg id="25">But such a calm erroneously.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it turns out, is now at the peak of the epidemic мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="27">More people die from мезотелиомы here than in any other country on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="28">The annual death rate in about 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease than as a result of road crashes.</seg>
<seg id="29">The annual number of deaths from мезотелиомы since 1980 and projected the number of deaths in the UK in the future</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason we feel its deadly consequences right now, lies in the fact that, although the use of asbestos and it is illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), for the development of мезотелиомы go usually tens of years.</seg>
<seg id="31">And the problem is not limited to veterans мезотелиомы specialties industrial construction.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was, and is, in many cases, remains in the house where we live, where we work, offices, schools, where we learn, and shops, where we go shopping.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention in class, profession, income level or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">The fashionable London избранности bastions, to private schools, as it turned out, not salvation.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parliament building is riddled with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even hospitals that are meant to cure us of deadly reservoirs have proved to be a carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was not трубоизолировщиком.</seg>
<seg id="39">Strictly speaking, he had to think where he might have come into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he realized.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It seems that there might be a lot of asbestos in tunnels in Guy's Hospital where I spent six years on it," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">All are students, nurses, doctors and грузчики - used these тоннелями.</seg>
<seg id="43">I wonder how many of my peers expect the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">It was a question to which, unfortunately, he was able to give a partial response.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Of the four doctors who we Guy at the hospital and have subsequently developed mesothelioma for the past five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I alone remained alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us expect this disease?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Лоусону was diagnosed with "mesothelioma," when he was 48 years old.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">Live so long is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty percent of patients die from mesothelioma eight months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is always fatal.</seg>
<seg id="52">So, now, we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us expect this disease?"</seg>
<seg id="53">According to a leading expert in the UK, Professor Джулиану Kolya Пито, most likely assume that the years between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain should bootmaker himself, by a man about to die.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most now are not that would die that way.</seg>
<seg id="55">Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada, with</seg>
<seg id="56">A quick review of reports from the halls of the court, where victims are often seek compensation, shows how far it has spread attack мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="57">In June, for example, Marks & Spencer acknowledged that included three Джэнис Ellen contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, apparel departments at two sites, one of which was the store on Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs Ellen was just 18 years old when she started working at M & S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now her two children are older than 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Before this happened," she says, "I have never heard of Kolya, I barely knew about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="62">And in my head I could not come to that, I will.</seg>
<seg id="63">Few people really know a lot about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="64">In fact, asbestos is not one substance, and a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">They get their name from the word "асбестиформ", which means the fibrous structure, which tells them the strength and flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="66">Of those six, three were often used in construction.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotile, widely known as white asbestos, much more often than other occurs in buildings today.</seg>
<seg id="68">It has been used in roofing panels, used his thermal insulation pipes, boiler, toilets, even the brake колодках cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">He less смертелен than other forms of asbestos, but still recognised by the European Union and the World Health Organization is "a source of serious health damage," which can lead to death.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, brown asbestos (амозит) and blue asbestos (крокидолит).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts have suggested that "there are good, though indirect reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with mesothelioma [in the UK]."</seg>
<seg id="72">An employee of the Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the main store on London's Oxford Street, with</seg>
<seg id="73">Джэнис Ellen may not have thought of yourself as a victim, but Julian Пито мезотелиомы work suggests that her story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that a "substantial percentage мезотелиом when there is no known exposure at work or at home, were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment."</seg>
<seg id="75">The bulk of this impact, he says, is "normal" weather exposure and use in our buildings.</seg>
<seg id="76">No one, it seems, can't be sure that he is safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">The report Goddard Consulting, which was in the palace of Westminster, demonstrates how people, even in the heart of government, may have been exposed to unconsciously.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009, Goddard said that technical mines and pipelines for the premises of parliamentary committees were infected with deadly asbestos fibers, which could follow in the movement, something so harmless as "strong currents of air."</seg>
<seg id="79">Members of the parliament often blame the fact that they are pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.</seg>
<seg id="80">Although the dish on the maintenance of Parliament insisted that Westminster Palace received a "clean bill of health," and now she recognized that it is necessary to work on the £1 billion for the reconstruction of the Parliament, by upgrading electrician and removing asbestos, and that after the general election in 2015, possibly members of parliament, will meet in the conference centre disproportionately to nearby, not on the green benches horizon.</seg>
<seg id="81">Goddard report noted that "the situation with the asbestos was ruled not in accordance with the various rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">It is impossible to know whether this error management cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All I can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">One of those who could not identify their exposure to asbestos is Graham cost, general practitioner.</seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson, cost, 50 years, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I worked at the hospital, which has successfully been indicted claims associated with asbestos," he says, "But I can't prove this in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It's so hard to remember all the places where he worked, and dates.</seg>
<seg id="88">What he remembers clearly, so this day in early December 2009, when his wholly overcame something that was like the flu.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly were shaken as me.</seg>
<seg id="91">It started very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terrible.</seg>
<seg id="93">I thought that I won't be able to drive all the way to homes.</seg>
<seg id="94">Being a doctor, knew that cost comes from pain, including checking for iframe loads a shell around the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="95">However, like Джэнис Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect мезотелиому.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the end, he could not walk to work a month.</seg>
<seg id="97">7.8 doctors doing chest x-rays and плевральные катетеры to pull fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis.</seg>
<seg id="98">And yet his condition оставлось without the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">Gradually, his health has improved, and he returned to work.</seg>
<seg id="100">But from time to time, those same symptoms return, often after he engaged in sports, and he breathed heavily.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, one of the patients came to him in Dubai office with similar symptoms, and he was later diagnosed with mesothelioma. ""</seg>
<seg id="102">But even then the cost of not linked it with its own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">In the end, his patient was on ten years older and worked with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">In this case, the connection was obvious.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011, the condition worsened again, Dubai and Kazakhstan his doctor showed him the results of x-rays and CT experts group.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, exactly two years after the cost began to feel ill, the sensor, equipped with a camera, was introduced into his chest cavity between the shell and shell of his lung.</seg>
<seg id="107">I'm an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I usually just go further, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="109">I'm not too upset about it, to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife, experienced.</seg>
<seg id="111">The biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that it was mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham: Cost of mesothelioma diagnosis</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly cost sank during meetings with Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested he contact a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">It was then that he realised the scale of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turns out that asbestos was commonly used, especially in large public buildings, and where quite often there was asbestos thermal insulation systems on the planet," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, now succumb to the disease.</seg>
<seg id="117">Thus, mesothelioma now affects more young people, atypical professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous isolated the asbestos pipes in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees who were on pedestrian tunnels connecting nearby landmasses can bring together to get from one building to another (as Andrew Lawson), or eat in the basement canteens (how often did Graham cost) almost certainly really were exposed to toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">For several decades after the war, as it turns out, the hospital was a place where, in theory, pulled the life for поциентов, but a place, which constituted a threat to life for doctors who treated them.</seg>
<seg id="121">It still continues to resonate today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students set their burners Бунзена on 3rd Son</seg>
<seg id="123">And it's not just hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and мэриях because of his amazing insulating and огнестойких characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="125">Schools too.</seg>
<seg id="126">Strictly speaking, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the classroom for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="127">Nationwide, on countless chemistry lessons, students set their burners Бунзена 3rd on tap.</seg>
<seg id="128">Websites have appeared, highlighting the problem of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as floor tiles or roof сараев typically contained asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"It's an industrial poison, in a huge number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson's case against the hospital in Guy.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case, the only contact that she could remember the woman who was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So be careful, снося garden sheds.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effect of the diagnosis, when we know that the disease is incurable, is huge.</seg>
<seg id="134">"To realize it, is quite a lot of time," says Graham cost.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realised that I couldn't focus on what I'm doing.</seg>
<seg id="136">I spent two weeks in surgery.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I realized that I had to go and deal with them.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I could no longer meet Christmas</seg>
<seg id="139">One of the most difficult things was the transition from doctor to patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">As countless patients before him, he remembers, was confused with information that should have been taken.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It has been difficult for everyone to understand," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked his doctor" how many I have time? "</seg>
<seg id="143">Gave me about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember, as I thought, "Well, I'm not a Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's all. "</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, as it is the mechanics of how we support life, "is the act of breathing -- causes cancer, which kills.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases are caused by мезотелиомы contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="148">Composed of tiny asbestos fibers.</seg>
<seg id="149">When asbestos is being destroyed and the carcinogenic fibers, they can get stuck in the lungs, плевре shell.</seg>
<seg id="150">Irritating плевру asbestos fibers and may cause cell mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem is due to the inhalation of asbestos fibres needle," Professor Tom Трежер, кардиоторакальный surgeon, who came to the hospital in 2001, Guy.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is the same hospital where Andrew Lawson, as suspected, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="153">Трежер knew Lawson's and treated some of the others who, perhaps, was exposed to while in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">When иголочки asbestos into the lung tissue, "says Трежер breathing them unload on the periphery, where the shell.</seg>
<seg id="155">It is, in its essence, think the process from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="156">Conventional treatments of other forms of cancer is much less effective in Kolya.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, cause hot debate.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some think it's worth a try.</seg>
<seg id="159">Трежер disagrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">"You can't cut плевру," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">No good around her with a knife.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, the cancer is "not very well to chemotherapy," which "acts", but not people.</seg>
<seg id="163">"From time to time there are patients who live a long time," says Трежер.</seg>
<seg id="164">But ultimately, they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some patients are living much, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">Writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after he was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years after diagnosis, Graham cost continues to fight.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he became ill from mesothelioma, Andrew Лоусоном on Dubai, which, four years after the diagnosis, single-handedly turned into office support and consultation for these same patients.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Yes, Раковая Central," he said cheerfully, as they are called.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," says cost.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was diagnosed with four years ago, and he still is very energetic.</seg>
<seg id="172">First Эбботту offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and had prolonged his life only a month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was in despair," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, "managed to somewhat more positive agenda."</seg>
<seg id="176">Meeting with several specialists, decided to continue the treatment cost with Professor Лоиком Ланж-Лаздунски торакальной, professor of surgery at Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage in that I don't need it, I just called them and they took me," admits Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">Consultants to the patient would have to get the direction and approval for funding.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money plays a decisive role for patients with mesothelioma, in order to get the best available treatments.</seg>
<seg id="180">But when such treatments become ineffective, finally, inevitably, many patients are facing another financial reason for concern "about the future of the families that they would leave.</seg>
<seg id="181">And then they ask the courts for compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan, of Field Fisher Price Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It has been known that asbestos is harmful to health, in 1898," said Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But that changed in the 1960s, is that it became clear that even very small quantities can put their health at risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">It was then spoke about the bad faith of companies.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson, and Guy's Hospital, ultimately, resolve the matter, but this was not a "settlement at full price," according to Morgan, as Lawson could not clearly prove that his mesothelioma was a result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation into his death, hospital spokesman Guy finally confirmed, however, that "asbestos in its basement, mentioned above, was removed in the 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="188">It was too late for Andrew Lawson's.</seg>
<seg id="189">How to remove asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">In fact, tie deadly contact with asbestos to one company or place of work - usually through dozens of years after that, it turned out to be a big problem for patients with mesothelioma, demanding compensation.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have changed owner or shut down.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance archives could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who have protected from lawsuits, knows that time is on their side, plaintiffs have, of course, no.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, earlier this year took a serious new legislative acts which facilitate patients with mesothelioma compensation recovery process, even if it is impossible to track down their former employers.</seg>
<seg id="195">In accordance with this law, was created by £350-миллионный fund of funds, which is financed by the insurance industry, for those who had been diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove the contact, but not anyone with whom to sue.</seg>
<seg id="196">In such cases, patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in a case about the compensation of about £pirates.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful claims under this scheme is expected to be every year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with mesothelioma, believes that the £350 million represent a "very good job" for the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"This transaction, which insured for insurers," he says, hinting that the sum is a quarter of that, insurers would have to pay if it had not intervened time and patients with mesothelioma would be able to trace the company and file a lawsuit in the usual way.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even Mike Пеннинг, previously minister for work and pensions, acknowledged that the law "imperfect."</seg>
<seg id="201">But Пеннинг, and Morgan acknowledged that, in view of the fact that seven people die every day, rapid action was needed.</seg>
<seg id="202">"People suffer so much, and they need help now," said Пеннинг during the second reading of the Bill about Kolya in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">By the time Graham cost was in the hands of Professor Лоика Ланж-Лаздунски 19 months.</seg>
<seg id="204">After the initial consultation Ланж-Лаздунски recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Трежера, he believes to be effective.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was followed by radiation and chemotherapy -- in which тритерапия Ланж-Лаздунски boasts pristine 40 percent of patients surviving for five years.</seg>
<seg id="206">Cost felt a surge of strength.</seg>
<seg id="207">"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says cost.</seg>
<seg id="208">You see these patients all the time.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is a force that supports you.</seg>
<seg id="210">When сдаешься, condition can deteriorate very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham lay down on the cost of the operation in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">By the end of August he finished last of six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">Subsequent scans showed no trace of disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I did a scan in March [2014].</seg>
<seg id="215">There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I just should have been within reach 50.</seg>
<seg id="217">This is not a threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="218">This is the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="219">And again the cost went through six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now there is no trace of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="221">However, this process is both physically and emotionally heavy.</seg>
<seg id="222">You can think about practical things - about finances, and when I die, for example, or about the fact that we need to show his wife, as well as works on a timer бойлере.</seg>
<seg id="223">When you get bad news, you become безрадостным.</seg>
<seg id="224">We need to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="225">As the father of Ellie, 16, and 14 years old, it Тэмзин is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">"It's hard for the parent," he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.</seg>
<seg id="228">For the first time when I was diagnosed, I told the girls that I had the disease, which means that I won ’ t live to old age.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders, protesters promise revenge</seg>
<seg id="2">China's parliament decided Sunday to not allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reforms.</seg>
<seg id="3">Such a move would likely mark the beginning of long ago promised protests in Hong Kong as activists have begun planning and mobilization in a matter of hours after that statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the 11th National People's Congress, in fact, communist leaders to remove all the candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's not обмануло our expectations, but still leads in rage," said lawmaker Emily Лау, chairman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is not something that Beijing has promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">They lied to people in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defending the decision of China, Li Fey, Deputy General Secretary of the Standing Committee of the 11th National People's Congress, said that to allow public nomination for elections of Hong Kong would be too "erratic behavior."</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing promised to allow residents of the region to choose the head of government by voting, starting in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Sunday, Chinese leaders have taken the decision as a democratic step forward, since it gives a direct vote гонконгцам right; however, the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process in his hands with the aid of the Commission on the Nomination, rigidly controlled from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, according to a new article that only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be admitted.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision was taken after the summer, when there have been some of the most large-scale and received wide coverage of protests in Hong Kong for many years.</seg>
<seg id="14">For a large part of the campaign after Occupy Central movement in Hong Kong is With Love and Peace, which threatened to cut off the financial district in Hong Kong if Beijing does not guarantee real universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sunday night, a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central gathered in the rain to Hong Kong government headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="16">The demonstration, which organisers claimed that their movement is shifting to a new phase of civil disobedience and that they rise up on the waves of protest in the next few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, they have not reported the details, obviously, to avoid problems with government bodies.</seg>
<seg id="18">In онлайн-заявлении organizers reported that the movement "обдумывало any takeover of the central district only as an exceptional measure, action that can be taken only if all the possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We regret to inform you that today, all possibilities have been exhausted and the dialogue will certainly capture the central district.</seg>
<seg id="20">Authorities in Hong Kong were preparing to Beijing a few days, and on Sunday at the headquarters of the government had strengthened security measures involving police and barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">The unrest is a sense among many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their own city.</seg>
<seg id="22">An influx of residents from mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also intensifies the fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, and begin to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying that his demonstration to jeopardize the business is the source of life force in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protest, which they say it could cause great economic damage, depending on how many people would take part or how long," said lawmaker Regina Yip, who has long been critical of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="26">We don't want to spread concern about the fact that Hong Kong can spin out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This view, which is harmful for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chinese state media also gave reports in recent days, in which Hong Kong activists of the democratic movement, were shown диверсантами направляемыми Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral law, which drew tripped participants - more than one-fifth of voters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in July, tens of thousands took to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists are raising questions of racial identity and behavior of police after Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">Unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Фергюсоне, Missouri, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">Coming raise their hands, chanting: "Hands up, don't ice" while they wait in line in front of the burial.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Missouri, Фергюсоне, associated with the murder of teenager Michael Brown, blogger безоружного Miriam зоила Perez noticed a shift in интернет-разговоре among white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">In her experience, the white feminists, leave comments put gender above race, when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, as tensions rose in the Midwest and attracted national attention, Peres saw the white women who is 100 percent focused on the race.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared with the reaction of black women shortly after the killing on 9 August, personal essays with such titles as "thoughts about Фергюсоне on behalf of a white woman" and "Феминизм is not only about the example of women" came relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Perez, they demonstrated a significant shift.</seg>
<seg id="9">"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who are talking about white skin and Privileges on such a high level," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People feel the need to say something about what has happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's very symbolic for the crisis with which we are faced, and because of the situation in Фергюсоне) is so tied to race, they feel that it is necessary to specify.</seg>
<seg id="12">For a professor of English at the University of Ohio Кориты Mitchell Ferguson has laid bare problems that blacks face every day, but one which is not perceived as a "women's problems" in the cultural sphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can write something funny on Facebook about what was going on with me and my partner and get 150 лайков from everywhere," says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">When I write something about how colored people are attacked in his own country, silence clearly.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Why do women safely publicly talk about relationships, but about security in the public sector?" She asks.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women, like Mitchell, who studied the issues of race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between matters relating to race and gender.</seg>
<seg id="17">From her point of view, blacks, women are clearly in a position to share these problems; they are faced with a complex reality every day.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women now bring together issues of race and gender in feminist мейнстриме, Энджела Хэттери, professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that its predecessor did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 1865 and 1890 years линчевали at least 10,000 black men, and the reason that is almost always served as the rape of white women," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="20">Need a white woman, was a story to justify Nepal.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the point of view of Хэттери, the gap between white and black women occurred when white you have, for example, Susan B. Anthony looked at the situation in the late 1800s, and saw that the fight for suffrage will be effective only for one of the groups: Women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They decided to put all its eggs in the basket of voting rights for women, and the right to vote for blacks would appear later," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="23">Look back on things like this gives us a clear idea of why colored women don't trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have not done anything good.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to ensure that the white women united against mob lynchings in the South during the Women's Association to prevent mob lynchings.</seg>
<seg id="27">This group appeared nearly 40 years after the first was asked to help blacks, women, "said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">From the point of view of Mitchell, the reactions of white feminists on the issues raised in the Фергюсоне situation, "the conduct of the police, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white a feminist had to" catch up "problems with which Blacks women cope in several generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"However, it would be fine, if female, which have such a [traditional] феминистическая ideology, so seriously would be to raise a child, how they relate to the right to contraception?" Asked Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="30">The second wave feminists who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to контрацептивам, now are beginning to understand what that means.</seg>
<seg id="31">Known white activist Gloria Стайнем феминистического movement two weeks after the killing of Michael Brown took Фейсбуком and published a sharp колумнистки Rebecca Carroll, Guardian article which claimed that white Americans were more participation in protests on issues of racism.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope that women who have another, but to understand the reason behind the split in the body - and the point of view of the racial problems that are substantially different in surveys of the public - will be at the head of the change," wrote Стайнем.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Стайнем she vouched for more пересекающийся feminism, which includes and issues of race and gender, her comments about race in America still are surprised by some.</seg>
<seg id="34">Researcher Christina Соммерс American entrepreneurial institute, and the author of "Who stole feminism?," she said She The People, that young men of color in the United States, especially to young people, "is much more vulnerable than their sisters', but on the contrary Фергюсоне Стайнем negative criticism, which she previously clear.</seg>
<seg id="35">We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for the boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">But when the White House has recently initiated a programme, "Сторож my brother" to help the vulnerable black and young men, followed the US changed remarkably испаноговорящим reaction from many feminists, including those from Gloria Стайнем.</seg>
<seg id="37">Police relationship with the black community is not the only problem, продвигающая helm of traditional feminism.</seg>
<seg id="38">After the U.S. Border Guard Service arrested around 63000 unaccompanied minors at the southwestern edge of the country this year, immigration reform again came to the surface - this time as a problem with women.</seg>
<seg id="39">Andrea China, co-chair of the organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to make this issue as important for women, she had only to share stories immigrant women.</seg>
<seg id="40">"They speak for themselves," said China.</seg>
<seg id="41">When the vast majority of the workers' visas are issued [иммигрантам-мужчинам], women who come with them, find themselves in positions vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="42">"These stories will resonate with women's organizations," she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Ministry wants to accelerate the growth of the market for electric cars</seg>
<seg id="2">This week the government would contribute Economic Development of a comprehensive development plan for clean vehicles in Russia, told the deputy director of the ministry, Oleg Плужников round table that held the Vedomosti on Moscow Carlisle - 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">The plan is drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals is to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is expected that the document will be passed in late September and early October, says Плужников, proposed measures concern the development of electric cars and hybrids - vehicles газомоторном plan to fuel in Russia already have.</seg>
<seg id="5">(A copy of the plan obtained by Vedomosti) is designed for 2014-2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">Yet to develop assessment criteria for electricity and hybrid vehicles and decide how to promote the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">The government report, which will be described in the tax and customs measures to support quality, will be prepared by December 2014; concessional lending scheme and a preferential leasing will appear by April 2015; and the proposal to reduce prices, stimulate creation and localization service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014-2015, is expected to amend the regulations to ease conditions for building infrastructure charge for parking, petrol stations etc.).</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, federal officials plan for 2015 to formulate proposals for regional authorities, as well as to promote the use of clean transport - in the form of granting him benefits when driving and parking, for example; and at the end of February 2016 - and proposals on the expansion of the government purchases of such transport.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, the Ministry of Economic Development by October 2014 will already have a list of indicators to assess the activities of the regional authorities of criteria that reflect the effectiveness of the support for the production of clean transport, the development of the infrastructure charge.</seg>
<seg id="11">The market in electric cars in Russia, while only formed in 2013 across the country sold around 100 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="12">In early 2014 обнулена an import duty on electric cars, so sales will be approximately 500 pieces, predicts Chief Executive Director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="13">But пятикратный growth does not make any noticeable: Electric cars in Russia in 2013, according to the Association of European Businesses, sold 2,78 million passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sunderland still in Russia imports only Mitsubishi Motors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Start import preparing Renault - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says director for strategic planning and partnerships in Russia Renault Nicolas Ремиз.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most of the other manufacturers' electric vehicles took in relation to Russia is taking a wait-and-see approach.</seg>
<seg id="17">Development of electric cars and Russian manufacturers GAZ CEO, "", "," but the trivial.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in January - July 2014, according to the "АСМ-холдинга," Avtovaz has issued 30 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="19">Due to the modest demand for U.S. products, "admits director of AvtoVAZ engineering Sergei Аманов, without state support will not be a breakthrough in this segment.</seg>
<seg id="20">Development of the Russian market in addition to the new electric cars (those electric cars that are sold in Russia, on average twice as expensive counterparts with internal combustion engines) holds an underdeveloped infrastructure charge (Economics - units), "sighs CEO Sergei Автостата Целиков.</seg>
<seg id="21">Because of the soaring prices and low rates of decline in the cost of electric cars in the next 3-4 years remain нишевым segment of the Russian market, "predicts editor-in-chief Mikhail Авторевю Подорожанский Целиков, agrees with him.</seg>
<seg id="22">Manufacturers, by contrast, say that some models of electric cars are already close to normal.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Russian market is substantially good prospects, the important thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "real" электромобильность; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of the new charging stations, underscores the president Wolfgang Шлимме BMW Group in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="24">Such infrastructure projects, for example, is implementing the "Россети:" In Moscow, several stations, soon there will be more about 80.</seg>
<seg id="25">Talks on the construction of a network of Economics and negotiations with other regions.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to the director of the department "Россетей" Vladimir Софьина, the company believes the market is ready to build electric and gas stations across the country, but there are problems: A small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging different brands.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, "Россети" as network the company does not have the right to engage in the sale of electricity, being able to do this in relation to charging.</seg>
<seg id="28">His wife believes the most effective measure in support of Russia's market substantially progeSOFT customs duties.</seg>
<seg id="29">Zero rate will act before the end of 2014, its renewals, extensions of preferential list.</seg>
<seg id="30">The replacement vehicle tax on ecological (the idea is being discussed and concerns all machines), too, will support the market, but not as noticeably as customs preferences, his wife said.</seg>
<seg id="31">Tax in Russia is small, said Pankov, unlike, for example, from Norway, where the reduced tax rate led to a sharp rise in sales of electric cars -- now they account for 12% of the market.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, and the need for stimulus measures, such as free parking in the centre of town (as it has done in Moscow), I am sure Pankov, or any movement of dedicated lanes for electric cars, which are not yet in Russia.</seg>

<seg id="6">On the night of August 29, the White House said that President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will discuss any imposition of additional sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The weakening of the ruble is long-term in nature and, in tandem with the euro, and in tandem with the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="8">The long-term forecast assumed that mark, "says senior analyst at Alpari" Anna Бодрова. "</seg>
<seg id="9">All of that has to do with Ukraine, one way or another will be reflected on the courses.</seg>
<seg id="10">As long as this continues, investors will react.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, rumors about the invading troops are not confirmed nor with one hand, but the market was very emotional.</seg>
<seg id="12">All the talk about the fact that he was resistant to such news, yesterday were перечеркнуты.</seg>
<seg id="13">This week, according to specialist, closes around these levels, and the rouble 37,05 36,90 per dollar.</seg>
<seg id="14">The tax period ended, oil prices, weak policies, sanctions, the problem of transit of gas through Ukraine are all links in the same chain.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also projected inflation accelerates to current prices for fall by end-2010 from 5 to 10 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon, to the same end, seasonal vegetables and fruits, and there will be a vacuum, so long as the network переориентируются on other suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The dollar went up to 37 roubles, went through it and came back, some powerful hysteria," said head of analysis of markets "Opening Broker" Konstantin Bushuev.</seg>
<seg id="18">Still will be watching whether the promised Saturday to impose sanctions, as will meet NATO.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said the ruble weakened sharply after the tax season, then went to the news on Ukraine, by the same token, the Central Bank last week said that before the end of the year, moving to a fully floating exchange rate and waives any currency interventions.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you look at the daytime wobble, then it is no different from the previous ones during this month, all have spooked that mark in 37 rubles, "continued the analyst.</seg>
<seg id="21">And so, in terms of the turnover of a powerful, nothing has happened.</seg>
<seg id="22">Worrying times for the currency market were, as I recall when, in late January was an increased demand for the currency, as well as 3rd March, when the Central Bank отгрузил a record number of currency.</seg>
<seg id="23">In UFS IC and see the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="24">First of all, this increase in the revenue part of the budget from the export operations, as well as to increase the competitiveness of domestic manufacturers at the expense of the expensive imports, says chief analyst UFS IC Alexei Kozlov.</seg>
<seg id="25">Negative moments can be attributed to the cost of imported goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency to significantly reduce the attractiveness of the investment in the Russian economy, provoke growing inflationary pressures and, as a result, become expensive for borrowing funds which, in turn, slows down the development of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="27">If we talk about the stock market, the rouble devaluation smoothes over a fall in share prices, expressed in roubles.</seg>
<seg id="28">For example, the MICEX index during trading Thursday fell 1.67 percent and the RTS had lost 3.27 percent.</seg>
<seg id="29">Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of reduction of indices due to the weakening of the ruble during the day more than 1.5%.</seg>
<seg id="30">The weakening of the ruble is an emotional character and can be explained by a massive desire to buy the currency.</seg>
<seg id="31">In practice, gradually emotions go on there, and quotes the ruble partially or fully restore some lost ground.</seg>
<seg id="32">"We believe, soon we will be able to see the value of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles to the dollar," said Alexei Kozlov.</seg>

<seg id="2">Восстанавливающаяся economy means more customers, the more sales and jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Account for taxes on the state and local level for companies across the country, moderately increased in the last year, when the economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study, published last week, and the company in the Washington area is no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion in the coffers of the state and local level in fiscal 2013, to 3.8 percent more than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tax burden on the state and local level in the past year rose by 4.3 per cent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after overtaking each other years when account disparities, in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">State taxes, rose 4.3 percent, faster than the local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to the study, which was conducted by professional services firm, Ernst & Young and the Center for taxable state group on tax policy.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the tax revenue in the county, 56 percent, in taxes on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of tax revenue for Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia, with 28 percent, is the lowest amount of tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="10">To a large extent, the growth in tax revenues caused by returning to the same level of value real estate companies, the researchers say, that raised property taxes by 3.7 per cent this year, after three years in a row, when growth was less than 1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large proportion of these revenues account for large states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same thing is happening in the Washington area.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion property taxes at the state and local level in the past year, to $9.6 billion more than in 2012 - a rise of 4.2 per cent, compared with the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the observed return value of the property does not have a similar effect on growth in tax revenues for state and local taxes in Maryland, where prices barely exceed one-fifth of companies' tax bills.</seg>
<seg id="14">Virginia's and the District of Columbia are paying about half the tax bills on the state and local level, in the form of property taxes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"What is happening in Maryland is that such a large part of their property, particularly tax base around the District of Columbia, is owned by either the government or nonprofit organization that does not pay property taxes," said Douglas Линдхолм, executive director of the Center on taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, Maryland forced to rely much more on personal income taxes, for example, to pay for those services that exist in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent increase in tax receipts from businesses cannot fully explain the recovery of the real estate market.</seg>
<seg id="18">Income entrepreneurs also, it seems, are on the mend, according to this data.</seg>

<seg id="3">The duo Royal Blood all year on the stage, but he already has the nomination to be the opening act on a tour of the BBC, and a visit to the Arctic Monkeys gig from the New York-based гримерку Jimmy right.</seg>
<seg id="4">Their debut album, Leif even for a few months before release received 100,000 предзаказов contract, and the issue lies in the major Warner Music.</seg>
<seg id="5">Given the present situation on the market, a musical плачевную situation of lambasted, because this is not about new Lana del Ray, or regular сладкоголосом representative "of the new R 'n' B ', and about the appearance of the British duo быковатых, playing with the level of volume and intensity, that the last time was in vogue two decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">In general, rates on the first album in connection with all вышеозначенными circumstances were especially high and is already quite justified.</seg>
<seg id="7">The duo is not a coincidence that took his name, which previously could encroach on what isn't quite so desperate and hairy metalheads, which flows the blood of kings, how they think, they have in the veins, which is also understandable.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is, of course, primarily about the heroes of the past levels of Led Zeppelin, and the great quartet, Royal Blood aim to shake застоявшуюся blood British rock, put it to a new level.</seg>
<seg id="9">To make predictions about the success of this enterprise until, perhaps, pretty early, but some say it is already possible.</seg>
<seg id="10">A dozen songs, with a small уложившихся in thirty minutes - it's not so much a phenomenal demonstration of how much thwarting композиторского gifts, and a powerful statement of intent.</seg>

<seg id="13">It will also highlight a "Little Monster" and November will record the song "Better" with шекспировской quote in the title.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the truth is that each of these songs would sound great at a party hard rock fans, but when playing in a row they merge into a more or less uniform cloth.</seg>
<seg id="15">And this is not necessarily bad, on the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Royal Blood in the fact that they do not claim the new Lennon and McCartney (rather too much in successors Motörhead) mark, but numerous рок-дуэты инди-клубов from the ghetto.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their music, despite some variety, created for stadiums, indoors, in less than a couple of thousand people, she is obviously closely.</seg>
<seg id="18">The secret lies in хитром use of bass, guitar took the usual format, with zero thought at the beginning of the White Stripes.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, it is not only instruments, but also in the approach to writing songs.</seg>
<seg id="20">Heroes ретророка zero with great difficulty outside their postmodern paradigm, with huge reluctance to admit to itself not just эпигонами and independent creative units.</seg>
<seg id="21">Royal Blood is now sound so heavily and the subsequent pressure that this successful and some драпирует вторичность твердолобость musical material.</seg>

<seg id="3">The news was a surprise, not because no one expected that it would be sold, and because many people expected that YouTube will be a buyer.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago, selling it for a billion Google видеосервису looked completely finished, and this combination was a natural.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set a goal to be потоковым service general nature - version of YouTube in real time.</seg>

<seg id="7">It is the interface.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Let's play," genre movies, in which всезнайки give (mainly old) games, as in "Таинственном theatre", already popular on YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="9">The fact is that YouTube is mentioned often, when we describe it, so the news that YouTube acquires it was without much interest, a classic example of a deep-rooted technology company выкупающей potential competitor.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's a mystery why deal with YouTube failed, given that, reportedly, he was willing to pay, no less than Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">All that we have at the moment is a statement from executive director Emmett have it: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term objectives, and they want to help us get there faster."</seg>
<seg id="12">Another mystery, frankly, it is an incredible success it is.</seg>
<seg id="13">Снобам like me, who say that sports will be better than watching him, it is hard to understand the appeal of watching games instead of himself to pick up a joystick.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is one thing to look over his shoulder at 3 a.m., while creeping through the resident Evil, and quite another to watch as an outsider, a man gets 20 shots in the head in a row as Call of Duty.</seg>
<seg id="15">All of the games that you could watch right now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are designed for one person, so I watch them shoot, not controlling the angle of view, can be a recipe for headache, a worthy Do It Right.</seg>
<seg id="17">I agree that high-speed transmission, in which Роджеры Бэннистеры of our electronic age completing the whole game in record time, entertain.</seg>
<seg id="18">But if we are not talking about виртуозе games or humor, it's unlikely that his channel it altogether will be interesting.</seg>
<seg id="19">But what they know skeptics like me?</seg>
<seg id="20">It had 55 million unique visitors per month, and it is the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.</seg>
<seg id="21">How Amazon works on this?</seg>
<seg id="22">It is hard to imagine that it свернется in Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube would simply absorb it.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, it is with pleasure that would have received any company: The crowd of young men, of whom dream of advertisers.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cunning ways to save on university textbooks</seg>
<seg id="2">The fact that the cost of university textbooks for many students more than $1000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move to the second course, came up with an ingenious way to reduce costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">He developed a system of how to borrow books, offering them for rent старшекурсников rated compensation that they delayed their sale.</seg>
<seg id="4">"My textbook on mathematical analysis, which typically costs $180 for a semester, I got $10 and biscuits" Chick-fil-A "," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying in Ковенант College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The literature on the cost would be $430 last semester, he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He spent $120.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the Council, the average college student spends $1,200 a year on books and supplies, but the students have a number of options to reduce these costs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas, such system Schroeder.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rent books is becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use a book during the semester, and often costing substantially cheaper than buying them.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Нибо Инкорпорейтид", which holds more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of rental books grew by half since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">Industry studies show that about a quarter of books in university bookstores during the past spring semester were taken, said the vice president "Нибо" Trevor Meyer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fewer than half of all books sold in university bookstores, according to the National Association of Choirs professional union shops. "</seg>
<seg id="13">Here's introductory course on the best ways to make a great deal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Purchase in store</seg>
<seg id="15">Sometimes, if you will connect to the Internet, the price of a new book could constitute one third of that, what you will see in the university bookstore.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis," Ron Larson ’ s Bruce Edwards and Robert Хостетлера worth about $290 privately, but a copy can be purchased for $239,99 site Chegg.com, which specialises in selling textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Buying подержанного</seg>
<seg id="18">If you don't mind other people's notes or injuries, second-hand textbooks are a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Mathematical analysis" sold for $93,49 подержанном form on to Chegg.com.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Кэсэдей, 25 years later, a fourth year student at the University of Бригэм Young, said that paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of the book "strategic decisions in the media: An understanding of the business side of the advertising business."</seg>
<seg id="21">The book sold for $48.</seg>
<seg id="22">Teachers, for instance, Ingrid Брейси, director of "College without walls" at the University of Massachusetts in Эмхерсте, offers students refine their professors, if not to previous editions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates are insignificant for classes.</seg>
<seg id="24">In such cases, the old editions can often be found in a very small fraction of the cost of the latest edition.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition to websites Amazon and Chegg, Half.com, "owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying second-hand books.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hire</seg>
<seg id="27">About to take textbooks to hire, you need to think, if you're good enough to appeal to them, don't forget to return them and don't want to leave them yourself after the course is completed.</seg>
<seg id="28">You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, a student could rent a "Математический analysis" for a semester for about $20.</seg>
<seg id="30">Check the rules before the store, where you take the books, including any fines that you can write the notes, underscore and damage.</seg>
<seg id="31">If you take a book rental, remember: If you don't give the book, fines may even exceed the cost of the new instance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Electronic books</seg>
<seg id="33">Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks is another option.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sometimes such books actually take electronic purchasing a license for a certain period for retailers, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Rent" on the site Chegg.com Mathematical Analysis for six months will cost about $61.</seg>
<seg id="36">Брейси says that students who study literature, can often find the most advantageous prices, as many of the classics, you can now add, whereas literature on natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.</seg>
<seg id="37">No matter what, осмотритесь.</seg>
<seg id="38">Joe Who, 29, who is going to start their studies in high school, and recommends that use Пеппердин ISBN number to book prices, as this will ensure that you are looking for precisely the right you text.</seg>
<seg id="39">But before you order online, says, "Who will check whether a book is in stock.</seg>
<seg id="40">For him the lesson Hemsedal is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="41">The delivery of the books, which he bought, was postponed for four weeks, and, in the end, he paid the full price at the university bookstore.</seg>

<seg id="39">Санкционное menu</seg>
<seg id="40">On 6 August, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree applying specific economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which is basically food sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="41">The country banned import of beef, pork, a by-product from meat and poultry, meat, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cheese, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausage and sugar syrups.</seg>
<seg id="42">Restaurants have begun jockeying seems with suppliers: Food prices have increased, we must urgently seek counterparts from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="43">This will affect the most expensive restaurants with монокухней France, Italy, Spain, in which products supplied directly from "motherships" countries.</seg>
<seg id="44">Общепиту activities and had been before.</seg>
<seg id="45">For example, when, at the beginning of 2014, the Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and the year before - the American and Canadian meat.</seg>
<seg id="46">In return, the suppliers have supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="47">But sanctions лета-2014 were far more serious.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the president's decree, which lifted the ban on Atlantic salmon and trout fry безлактозное seed potatoes, milk, sugar, corn, peas and onions for replanting.</seg>
<seg id="49">The Italian transfer hopes that sanctions might still смягчиться.</seg>
<seg id="50">As long as there is uncertainty in terms of restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="51">According to the company's "East-West", one of the world's largest suppliers of imported products in the premium segment accounted for up to 70%.</seg>
<seg id="52">"Expensive restaurants may change menus under that produce local farmers and other countries," says Sergei Mironov, another, owner of the agency "Рестконсалт."</seg>
<seg id="53">If a chef, for him it's not going to be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="54">But we have very little of these cooks, and the development of new menu items may take two to three months.</seg>
<seg id="55">Тригель Brasserie restaurant from "The Bridge" is ready to give up: From 10-15% to dishes, yet half the menu, recycle.</seg>
<seg id="56">In restaurants with a kitchen are starting to replace dishes, for example steak from marble beef - on бефстроганов, says Sergei Mironov.</seg>
<seg id="57">"Cheeses from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian cheeses and cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," lists the "East-West" Oksana Глибчук.</seg>
<seg id="58">Cream and milk products from Europe have counterparts in Russia and Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="59">Chicken from the United States may be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and salmon from Norway, the park is surrounded by семгой, from Belarus, and Chile.</seg>
<seg id="60">The absence of vegetables and fruits of European production may be at the expense of domestic manufacturers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.</seg>
<seg id="61">According to Mironov, rebuild their network components will be easier than премиальному segment: There is unlikely to be able to distinguish between the Reeperbahn, went to Italian моцареллу from Russian.</seg>
<seg id="62">Although it is difficult to have institutions Ginza Project, he says.</seg>
<seg id="63">The Ginza Project a few dozen restaurants under different brands and with their own menu.</seg>

<seg id="68">These include schools with kitchen CIS: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.</seg>
<seg id="69">"The Georgian kitchen no expensive products," says Хатуна Колбая Saperavi, owner of the Georgian restaurants and cafes "Vai мэ!."</seg>
<seg id="70">All cheeses for us to do in Russia, the basis of many dishes - chicken fillets, exotic herbs we don't use. "</seg>
<seg id="71">The establishments until Колбаи removed from the menu of a single cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="72">Timur colon, owner of the restaurants "high-born N1" with Uzbek cuisine, sanctions also might alert: He will have to change not only the новозеландскую sausages.</seg>
<seg id="73">If Russia our owned imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we even win in price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="74">From the CIS can be cheaper to get engineering, sausages, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit.</seg>
<seg id="75">At the same time, what brought from Central Asia, far better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="76">The Uzbek tomatoes all know that they are tasty, sweet.</seg>
<seg id="77">The Spanish one doesn't say so.</seg>

<seg id="81">McDonald's press service said that localization exceeds 85 per cent, and the network is working with 160 Russian suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="82">According to Tatyana Богдановой, head of the department for work with suppliers in public areas, about 80% of the food network buys in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with supplies of vegetables and increased prices for meat products that produce from the imported raw materials.</seg>
<seg id="83">In "Теремке" санкционные products "in general were not more than 4%.</seg>

<seg id="90">Even Georgian restaurants in the cost of food will rise by 5-10%, concedes Колбая.</seg>
<seg id="91">"East-West" denies this: "For example, the Belarusian milk products since August prices by 10-15 percent."</seg>
<seg id="92">"Brazilian suppliers raised prices for pork twice," complains Sergei Cancer, deputy director general of "Стардогс."</seg>
<seg id="93">Chicken legs rose by 35%.</seg>

<seg id="118">According to statistics, fishing in Russia in 2013 - more than 4 million tons, a substantial portion of fish goes to Japan, Korea and even in the United States.</seg>

<seg id="10">According to them, the maximum payout for non in connection with the accident, without the police, must not be lower than the limit on "европротоколу."</seg>
<seg id="11">But at the same time, it may not be, and above the limit specified in the agreement, non insurance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The idea, of course, useful and theoretically capable of relieving both its employees and roads.</seg>

<seg id="14">The last now talk about a serious threat to the growth of the fraud, which can result in the introduction of new rules for non payment.</seg>
<seg id="15">As for the drivers, it's hard to imagine what kind of work will have to be done to overcome as a Russian conservatism.</seg>
<seg id="16">In most cases, the driver would be hours to wait for the inspectors to make minor accident, because the lock.</seg>
<seg id="17">And it remains to be seen what will be simpler - beat swindlers or convince drivers in reliability "европротокола."</seg>
<seg id="18">Savings certificate will be registered and irrevocable offer</seg>
<seg id="19">The Finance Ministry wants to block savings certificates to the bearer, but will allow banks to do their analogue безотзывного contribution.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Finance Ministry is preparing a bill that would prohibit savings certificates to the bearer.</seg>
<seg id="21">Lately, this tool is gaining popularity, as rates here are higher than on bank deposits.</seg>
<seg id="22">The fact is that savings certificates on the bearer not the bank deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper because they don't have to make payments to the Fund Deposit Insurance Agency (pointed out).</seg>
<seg id="23">Successfully situation in the fact that this step will be taken because of the small and medium-sized banks, spreading such certificates, and suffer from Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which, according to estimates pointed to control 98% of the level of the market.</seg>
<seg id="24">With the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, which is about 3.5%.</seg>
<seg id="25">The problem, pointed out, the explanation lies in the fact that customers bought a small bank, such a certificate, in case of license revocation is trying to get money from him in pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying bearer savings certificates, may assume that their investment is insured.</seg>
<seg id="27">The absence of reasonable insurance payments on these certificated in case of license revocation the bank can lead to misunderstandings and social tensions.</seg>
<seg id="28">In practice, the agencies were cases when holders предъявительских certificates to seek indemnities through the court, "he said in a pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="29">The problem, of course, made-up.</seg>
<seg id="30">The certificates pay buyers still nobody will, because under the law they have no right to compensation from the State.</seg>
<seg id="31">If the case was that the instrument is insured in pointed, together with him and would have banned metal accounts, which means citizens are in grams of one of four metals: Gold, silver, platinum and palladium.</seg>
<seg id="32">Since these accounts do not fall into a system of deposit insurance, but their existence until nobody deprives.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is likely that the bearer certificates are a very convenient certifying that actually can act in the role of квазиденег.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the same time, their movements is not amenable to control: Almost every bank customer can buy a certificate to every citizen, and to putting this certificate can change a lot of owners.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is no coincidence that the draft that savings certificate must be issued in paper value, which must be stored in depositories.</seg>
<seg id="36">And that ’ s one banks such certificates be permitted to manufacture without the right to early repayment.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have introduced similar безотзывного contribution, which has long been a dream of the bankers.</seg>

<seg id="1">Met two Union</seg>
<seg id="2">The talks in Minsk Summit has not solved the problems for which they were called back, but has also produced a new format: The first face of the European Union met with the chief executives of the Eurasian future</seg>
<seg id="3">The disturbing drift and let the (the situation around Ukraine отлагательств does not tolerate), the leaders of the EU and Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of "hot issues."</seg>
<seg id="4">It is capable of such a structure to work effectively, it is not clear; but it is clear who took the cream from that summit.</seg>
<seg id="5">Questions on this one evening on August 26, when the Belarusians, and after them and other евразийцы with Europeans saw change the new President Lukashenko.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Belarusian leader revealed example отточенной учтивости, it was the behavior of a man who had just caught the jackpot - and is planning a decent old age in high society.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Maidan Lukashenko helped</seg>
<seg id="8">The arrival in Minsk just three main European commissioners (of the EU), who met with Mr. Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf -- not just легитимация president for the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is an application for recognition of a full-fledged subject of European policy, and a major campaign of the Ukrainian crisis.</seg>
<seg id="10">A senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Studies Denis Мельянцов sure: From now on, Brussels can't already speak with Minsk in the same tone as before.</seg>
<seg id="11">"What Catherine Ashton met face to face with Lukashenko, gives reason to believe that the relationship with the EU will be размораживаться and beyond," he said "Огоньку."</seg>
<seg id="12">This is the hidden part of the iceberg: Preparing to push the Belarusian authorities began long before November Maidan in Kiev - summer 2013-го.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The results have been achieved and the EU is the successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues about modernization," lists interlocutor of Ogonyok which -- and with the United States were held talks on international security.</seg>
<seg id="14">States even took a little bit of sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="15">As regards the Ukrainian events, then they and their reaction to the Belarus leadership only invoked another influx this process.</seg>
<seg id="16">Minsk, on the one hand, managed to preserve relations with Ukraine are warm enough, not much to lose in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for talks.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who admitted not de jure to Russia's annexation of Crimea and urged to punish pro-Russian militia-men in Donbas with all severity, and quarreled with Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="18">Minsk has not released any of the Customs Union, nor from the Collective Security Treaty Organization, and sometimes it is placed in a Russian air base.</seg>
<seg id="19">Brussels and Washington have noticed a balanced position of Minsk to the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated her confident Belarusian experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">How successful will the movement to Lukashenko's political diversification, will be seen by how often in the near future to meet in Minsk доведется EU + TC.</seg>
<seg id="21">The press office of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy Catherine Ashton and diplomacy have failed to answer questions about what Brussels wants from the relationship in a new format.</seg>
<seg id="22">A spokesman for Ashton said only "Mayan Косьянчич Огоньку" that decisions on issues of war and peace, this issue is not a priority.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the same time, there are reports that following a meeting on the Ukraine issue, with the participation of the people in the new format may be, and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="24">A drop of tar in Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that about him, it turns out, personally asked representatives of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nevertheless, at the final briefing Alexander Lukashenko made it clear: All sides are not opposed to Minsk remained a central platform for meeting both Россия--ОБСЕ--Украина format, and at the level of Heads of State and high representatives of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="26">This means that "the last dictator in Europe" рукопожатного acquires the status of a European leader who helps solve a global problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">Farmer's best friend</seg>
<seg id="28">Already the EU delegation included еврокомиссаров on trade and energy, pushed to the conclusion: The main underlying reason for the summit -- not the tragic situation in the Donbas, and economy.</seg>
<seg id="29">In fact, сверстанное meeting schedule future talks on the gas supply and to overcome the fear of the CU in the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU looks like an achievement and more extensive than peace declaration without specific dates and numbers.</seg>
<seg id="30">Trade Commissioner Karl De Гюхт, nevertheless, fax: EU officials "arrived in Minsk seek solution to the political crisis which has economic consequences, and not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="31">It seems, however, that the economy and the crisis in Ukraine "works" in Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its consequences - and above all reciprocal sanctions from the West and Russia - give Minsk, who until he feels санкционное pressure, with room for maneuver.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to the leader of the Mises Research Centre, Belarus Yaroslav Ramanchuk, European investors are actively interested in opportunities to Belarus for the supply of agricultural products to the Russian Federation in bypassing sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the same time, schemes are supply, for which President Vladimir Putin at the summit пожурил Minsk.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Billions of these schemes," said Romanchuk "Огоньку," are not the Belarusian businessmen and Russian companies.</seg>
<seg id="36">They worked on a scheme for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes were destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Russian businesses urgently need to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of the Belarusian authorities.</seg>
<seg id="38">The second story, "the expert continues," is linked to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not away to Belarus in the production of raw materials as well as focusing on the Russian market.</seg>
<seg id="39">Ukrainian producers have about 4 billion of exports to Russia, and the Belarusian производственно-торговые scheme now could prove very popular. "</seg>
<seg id="40">According to Ramanchuk, the role of the host site for the negotiations between the EU and the TC is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of the development of economic ties with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="41">He recalls that the loss of the agricultural sector of the EU sanctions against Moscow are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the Commission is currently proposed аграриям only 125 million euros in compensation.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Belarusian president could offer to Brussels to work together to minimise the consequences for еврофермеров.</seg>
<seg id="43">This could raise the authority of Lukashenko to the EU to unprecedented heights.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hospitality without initiatives</seg>
<seg id="45">Catherine Ashton thanked the authorities for the initiative for the summit.</seg>
<seg id="46">But the paradox is that the Minsk from his active role in the birth of TC + EU открещивается format, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with Ukrainian counterpart emphasized that the new format and it was Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="47">"It was your suggestion to come without навала discuss, not with бухты-барахты decide, after signing the Association Agreement with the EU, to sort out the situation, which at the time was in Ukraine," he remonstrated before the cameras to Peter Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, observers interpreted it as an attempt to calm the rumours that she was originally against the intermediation of Minsk, which greatly increases his political weight.</seg>
<seg id="49">In Belarusian diplomatic establishment try to stress that cooperation between the EU and Belarus in organizing the TC did not pursue a lucrative target, but the ultimate goal of this format in the future is the creation of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.</seg>
<seg id="50">"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts which, in other areas, in particular in the field of security, proposes and promotes the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation," the Foreign Ministry said "Огоньку" Belarus, which lately has been carefully select words.</seg>

<seg id="12">It's not people, we understand that this is a fatal flaw: Archetypes нуара smoothly, too confident player угодивший медовую trap "sex," the detective, corrupt упырь-сенатор.</seg>
<seg id="13">Oh, and as an archetype and an archetype погоняет вальсирует with an archetype, it is no longer a movie, or read that abstract painting.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin demands from Kiev to start negotiations on the "statehood" of eastern Ukraine</seg>
<seg id="2">According to Russian news reports about his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government has stopped fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately started negotiations on the "statehood" отделившегося region.</seg>
<seg id="3">His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later discloses that Putin had in mind the hint that восточноукраинская territory controlled by separatists will become part of Russia, but that her status within Ukraine should be revised to give русскоговорящему region to protect their rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, Mr Putin's call for the Government to start negotiations with furious government-controlled insurgents as with equal corresponds to the obvious strategy, which he follows from the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: To help rebels take territory and force the Ukrainian government give новопровозглашенной territory Новороссии de facto independence, to closer ties with Russia rather than with the West.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with the state-controlled Channel 1 television, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return retained in the eastern territory the separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk regions, both of which were seized in March and April, after Moscow be much stricter in Europe Ukrainian peninsula Crimea on March 18.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists recently named Новороссией captured territory, or New Russia, the name, which refers to the дореволюционным glory days of the Russian empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin has said that anyone who believes that peace talks will occur in the near future, as Ukrainian politicians to campaign for parliamentary elections on October 26, and while government troops attack peace settlement in detained separatists regions, "пленник illusions," Itar-Tass reported.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We must immediately begin substantive talks and not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the public status of Southeast Ukraine, in order to serve the interests of the people living there," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskov said that Putin's words about statehood had in mind in the context of a broader autonomy that was discussed during months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to allay fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and language rights at risk.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the government can provide the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions, "said Peskov.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is not a matter for discussion between Russia and Ukraine, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and an internal Ukrainian conflict."</seg>
<seg id="12">The intervention by the Kremlin's press secretary, to "rectify incorrect interpretation of the words" Putin stressed the decision of the Russian leadership to behave towards the separatist rebellion in the east in any other way than to open the seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the population are ethnic Russians 2-миллионного.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would have to endure much more heavy battle to attach even Луганскую area of eastern Ukraine's Donetsk and, as the majority of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian, and polls before the start of the conflict, showed broad support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">Autonomy, which Russian diplomats discussed at international forums gave regional governments in the Ukraine power themselves to trade agreements and foreign policy, in effect giving the Kremlin de facto control over the territory, which would be combined with the situation in the territory of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Black Sea peninsula, присоединенном five months ago, is the Russian military fleet, as well as commercial marine institutions and historical sea resorts.</seg>
<seg id="16">In regions between Russia's Rostov region and the situation also are mines, mills and casting plants that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has proposed in his inaugural address June 7, to Ukrainian lawmakers after new elections weighed an amendment to the constitution that would allow give отделившимся regions greater control of their finances and the status of the languages.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, his opinion on autonomy, it seems, is very different from the view of the Kremlin and повстанцев-сепаратистов in weapons, which accuse Moscow of aiding and abetting.</seg>
<seg id="19">Last call for Putin to Kiev to negotiate with the leaders of the separatists, as with equal, followed by new наступлениями rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks rolled into previously peaceful areas of eastern Ukraine along the Sea of Azov.</seg>
<seg id="20">Russia supported separatists took control of the city, the occurrence of which Новоазовск officers of the Ukrainian security services say they are afraid that he is starting a campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory to the Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="21">This led to a large-scale civilian and military efforts to strengthen the neighbouring port of Mariupol, with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Новоазовском and narrow 27 on the Crimean peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko on Saturday addressed the meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which was independent of 23 years.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We are approaching a point of no return came," warned Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukrainian territory.</seg>
<seg id="25">EU summit had not taken certain measures; leaders urged to draw up a project more harsh sanctions against Russia, which will be taken in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Ukrainian soldiers were forced to withdraw from their positions in Иловайске after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 soldiers last week in the Donetsk region, the greatest difficulties in order to support the separatists, Colonel Андрий Lysenko, a spokesman for the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Anger has turned out to be the most versatile and functional human emotion</seg>
<seg id="2">Сердитое expression is biologically universal for mankind, and everyone involved in the creation of his body and the muscle is not fortuitous, but an additional means of expressing power and threat, researchers have found in Australia and the US.</seg>
<seg id="3">About their discovery, they reported in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly about them you can read the press release of the University of California in Santa Barbara.</seg>
<seg id="4">Гневное expression - by climbing in and running down the eyebrows, lips, the thin line of 'bloated nostrils - equally in all cultures, and make it even blind from birth, children are never who saw, said study lead author Aaron Селл.</seg>
<seg id="5">As part of a major research project on the nature of the anger, the scientists found that arose this emotion for the effective conduct of disputes during the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="6">The more physical damage one man can do to another, the greater the opportunity to dictate to him, while he pleads to partner with anger.</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers have confirmed their hypothesis: Physically and other powerful people often get angry and switch to pitch invasions, consider themselves entitled to impose other accept unpleasant conditions for them, and they prefer the methods of solving conflicts peacefully.</seg>
<seg id="8">Starting from that anger is a bargaining emotion "first and foremost," the scientists decided that movements of each of the seven groups of muscles, creating сердитое гневающегося expression, should be an individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor, and thereby force as soon as possible to agree to its terms in order to avoid conflict.</seg>
<seg id="9">To test this hypothesis, the researchers modelled on a computer, where faces or had absent each of seven elements гневного faces, and showed them may be.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although by climbing in eyebrow or chin forward but shutting down discussion simply means the individual did not face evil, then this man with such traits of more powerful, physically study participants acknowledged unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="11">Anger as human, and with animals, expresses a threat: An exaggerated manifestation of his own forces, the reaffirmation to agree and to obey.</seg>
<seg id="12">Man поджимает inflated nostrils and lips with the same goal, and that frog, which надувается or бабуин, which demonstrates their fangs.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Anger" runs "refusal to accept the situation, and the face immediately takes shape, effectively has demonstrated the opposite side of the consequences of this failure.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the most striking is that none of the components гневного faces is not arbitrary, they are one and the same, "said anthropologist John Туби.</seg>
