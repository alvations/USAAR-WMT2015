<seg id="1">Remembering a very American ideal that labor rights are human rights</seg>
<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis suggested that the bill, which is protected by the unions as a civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Where there are jobs, trade unions and the middle class," says Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, who is co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive factions.</seg>
<seg id="4">That's why I proudly represent Act expanding workers ’ rights, together with the symbol of the movement for civil rights by John Lewis.</seg>
<seg id="5">This innovative bill will give workers the same opportunities for legal discrimination against trade union organization, and other forms of discrimination, opponents of trade union power</seg>
<seg id="6">Changing the Act regulating labour relations in such a way as to allow the workers encountering discrimination for participation in trade union organizations, to seek justice in the civil courts - and receive compensation and punitive damages payments - a sensible and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it's certainly not radical initiative - at least by American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the best way to understand the fact that offer Ellison, Lewis and co-authors of the bill, "recall is a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the attacks, which the unions have in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country, Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, to expand and to respect human rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country simultaneously defend democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas МакАртур and his assistants have helped the country to adopt a constitution, to ensure that my военизированная Хидеки Тодзё was replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included text that explicitly admitted that "the right of workers to organize and to negotiate, and the collective action is guaranteed."</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Эйзенхауер and his assistants have helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that fascism was replaced by Adolf Hitler a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recognizing that workers will need to be arranged and be heard in the new state, Germans have included an article, which openly stated: "The right to form associations with the aim to protect and improve employment and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict or seek to diminish that right, will have no legal force; measures for this purpose shall be deemed illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">When former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which was World Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, will be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the guarantee included the fact that "everyone has the right to organize and join unions to protect their interests."</seg>
<seg id="17">Generations of Americans take for granted our basic position that labor rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country advised by other countries about how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans have explained that the right to organize labor unions - and the fact that this union has participated as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - should be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now, when these rights are under assault in the United States, wisely, indeed, return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to ensure that their voices were heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:</seg>
<seg id="21">History is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now everyone knows that the trade union movement is not undermined the nation's power, but increased them.</seg>
<seg id="23">Raising the living standards of millions, unions miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to fragile level of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack on unions, forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.</seg>
<seg id="25">History remembers as they ought, and to us.</seg>
<seg id="26">The official recognition of labor rights as human rights and the protection of civil rights, to prevent discrimination against the trade union organizations, was long overdue.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the U.S., a federal judge on Sunday temporarily has blocked the introduction of the Louisiana law, which his supporters say he likely closes all five абортных clinics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to this measure, which was signed by the Governor of Louisiana Bobby Джинадлом in June and was supposed to go into effect September 1, doctors who do abortions, were obliged to have powers of patients in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nevertheless, the judge's decision means that, at the moment, doctors can continue to make legal abortion, while continuing to seek such powers.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally, continuing actions to gain power," he wrote in his decision, Judge John деГрэвеллз.</seg>
<seg id="6">The hearing will be scheduled within a month, at which a judge will take a more permanent solution on this law.</seg>
<seg id="7">Advocates of abortion rights, met with joy at the decision, the latest in a chain of decisions against similar measures, saying it will give doctors more time to receive hospital authority.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today's decision ensures that the women will be protected from the United Louisiana law, which seeks to deprive them of the health and human rights," said Nancy Нортап, president and head of the Center for reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the state's five clinics.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the decision applies to doctors from two clinics, which were claimants in the case, and also filed a request for authority.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, and the courts recently acknowledged such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="11">Key parts of texas law that would have closed most of the remaining clinics in the state were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fighters for the right to abortion, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association say that the powers of the laws impose restrictions on doctors who are not necessary from the medical point of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, though some also noted their positive effect in the closing clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only one doctor who does abortions in Louisiana, is in the hospital, according to the Center for reproductive Rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all the other doctors in the state will be forced to stop performing the procedure, the doctor, fearing for their safety, would no longer perform this procedure, the group reported.</seg>
<seg id="16">Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they will not punish doctors doing abortions as long as their statements on the reception awaiting decisions.</seg>

<seg id="1">What will the introduction of quotas for domestic products</seg>
<seg id="2">Not less than half of products for each type of product in the range trading networks should be the Russian production, says Duma deputy from Just Russia, Oleg Nilov has.</seg>
<seg id="3">The MP has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures for domestic manufacturers, writes the newspaper Izvestia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The document will still детализироваться to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.</seg>
<seg id="5">This applies to goods that are produced in Russia. <... > According to the rest of the groups of products, which are produced in Russia, the will provide at least half of the production of their domestic producers, "Nilov has said.</seg>
<seg id="6">Together with the amendments, in the article "On the basis of state regulation of trading activities in the Russian Federation," the bill provides for the introduction of changes to the Tax Code, laying down a 10 per cent rate of VAT until the product produced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea to introduce a 50% quota in -процентную retail chains included in the stimulus package for Russian producers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The shop appears several times more than domestic goods.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the initiative may have both positive and negative effects, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the lawyer, a member of the company's "Налоговик" independent think-tank "Public Duma Sergei Litvinenko for the Russian economy, as well as for domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive in nature, and will lead to growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">The key will be, farmers, and small shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">They will be able to sell more, and it means that profits will grow.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms and prices, retailers because they will be forced to buy their goods.</seg>
<seg id="14">Russian manufacturers will be able to increase the volume of its sales activities and that will lead to pay higher taxes than before.</seg>
<seg id="15">It will increase revenue, create new jobs, industries will grow any faster осваиваться, will be introduced to contribute to the growth of GDP.</seg>
<seg id="16">Russia's reliance on foreign food fall several times, though not immediately, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="17">Earlier, Russian companies are often unable to fight their way to the shelves of local stores due to higher competition from foreign rivals.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now, after the introduction of an embargo, this niche freed and we can breathe a sigh of relief.</seg>
<seg id="19">But do not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary inspections of food products to the Russian market will come from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="20">In other words, it is now "calm" moment when former players have already gone and the new has not yet come.</seg>
<seg id="21">Almost a month later, you can talk about modern demand for Russian raw materials, as well as rising prices for finished products, "said АиФ.ru first Vice President of Russian public institutions," the Russian club financial directors, "Tamara Kasyanov.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clearly, the idea of selling in each category at least 50% of the Russian food products will be the sector for local producers.</seg>
<seg id="23">In that case, they will compete with each other, and not with goods that subsidies at the expense of another state, are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="24">In other words, the buyer will struggle between the companies working on one of the industry.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, says Kasyanov, Russian producers are able to meet 50% of domestic needs compatriots not on all items.</seg>
<seg id="26">And in this situation commercial networks would have to "share" дотягивать Russian goods up to half of the range.</seg>
<seg id="27">In this regard, increasing fears that such substandard goods on the shelves.</seg>
<seg id="28">Perhaps under the guise of manufactured in Russia, will be delivered to foreign products with перебитыми labels, "adds an expert.</seg>
<seg id="29">The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will feel the large retail chains, especially those that выгодней cooperate with importers.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is logical that the prime minister will suffer and foreign suppliers, because the demand for their products.</seg>
<seg id="31">Litvinenko did not rule out that the law on quotas on domestic goods may impact on consumers.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fact of the matter is that some of the Russian production can yield quality imported ones, while shops will be boosting prices on the second as a scarce commodity.</seg>
<seg id="33">The single idea in the early 2000s, import substitution economists started talking again in February this year because of the ongoing devaluation of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="34">Now, against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the question of the import of products becomes even more urgent.</seg>
<seg id="35">The law is designed to oblige suppliers to retailers under orders from domestic producers.</seg>
<seg id="36">Then we go much faster and more confident on the path of import substitution, and the planning of the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter period of time, "says the MP Oleg Nilov has.</seg>
<seg id="37">Especially effective mechanism for those quotas will be agricultural sectors, where the potential is especially high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.</seg>
<seg id="38">Our farmers are able to fully cover the shelves in Russian shops.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition, may receive a powerful boost to consumer and production.</seg>

<seg id="2">Whether the Russians feel the sharp price increase</seg>
<seg id="3">The Russian proposal as a result of the sanctions and the inflation accelerates in Russia and not in forecasts уложится authorities believe, "VTB Capital analysts."</seg>
<seg id="4">According to experts, the delayed effects of lead to inflationary антисанкций ever in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the latest forecast, inflation in 2014 will be 6,5-7,5% the following year - and fewer than 6.5 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to the newspaper, "Kommersant," the commentary this week should make "small but significant" changes in macroeconomic forecast up to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the publication, the agency may lower estimate of inflation in 2015, which will eliminate progeSOFT expected revenue growth of the population.</seg>
<seg id="8">The forecast, which was supposed to be Russian food sanctions apply a year - until August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">In such a situation, you could assume such high inflation?</seg>
<seg id="10">The current situation is a shock, but during понижательный trend of inflation does not change, "said the source of the newspapers in all.</seg>
<seg id="11">Economists from VTB Capital does not share expectations regarding inflation and government economic bloc to predict price growth in 2014 at the level of 8%.</seg>
<seg id="12">The main effect of product bans will come together with the possible introduction of a tax on sales in other regions of the Russian Federation (GAP) in 2015, experts believe.</seg>
<seg id="13">Inflationary spike in 9% in February, after which the annual pace of price growth will go into recession, some experts believe.</seg>
<seg id="14">Incidentally, last week, Rosstat, let the inflation results, after Russia imposed sanctions "neat".</seg>
<seg id="15">АиФ.ru interviewed experts and found their inflationary expectations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Artem Деев, head of the analytical department of FC AForex:</seg>
<seg id="17">Price growth has been observed on the major segments of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moreover, when I began to appreciate the socially relevant products, the government was forced to launch measures to monitor systemic risks to price stability, in order to prevent unreasonable price increases in the short term.</seg>
<seg id="19">Suppliers and retailers already report on a daily basis before regulators that authorities knew exactly who was where and for what reason will trigger an increase in prices.</seg>
<seg id="20">Key factors for the growth of the consumer price index continues to be tremendous pace of capital flight, excessive refinancing the banking sector from the Russian мегарегулятора, internal convert because of the flight of foreign currency, as well as an arms embargo on the import of food from countries that joined the sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="21">If inflationary pressures remained under control, the cost of a minimum basket of products not jumped to 12 per cent in just one quarter.</seg>
<seg id="22">A ban on the import of food products provoked shock proposals on the internal market and led to a rise in the value of логичному.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because at this stage we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, and increase the size of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production, a response to the inflationary risks sanctions will continue the growth component.</seg>
<seg id="24">If you include another and fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as ухудшенными prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year, inflation could exceed 8%.</seg>
<seg id="25">Alexander Разуваев, director of the analytical department "par"</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 1990s, inflation sometimes hit 20-30% per month to zero, it was also higher than current levels, another thing that then it is offset by rapid economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="27">I think, at the end of the year inflation will be 8-8,5%.</seg>
<seg id="28">Plato Магута, managing assets of the Criminal Code, "the Fund Магута"</seg>
<seg id="29">An external factor associated with sanctions against Russia, while successfully contained, but if there is a further increase of the pressure, first and foremost, for the financial sector - this can lead to certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations, which usually manifest themselves in traditionally purchases cash currency to protect their savings.</seg>
<seg id="30">It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance will try to smooth the weakening rouble, as market practices and government regulation.</seg>
<seg id="31">But prices traditionally begins after a lull over the summer and, possibly, this fall will become more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="32">The target level of consumer inflation in Russia, 7.5%, most likely, because Russian выстоит has another financial savings.</seg>

<seg id="16">It is no secret that стройрынок develops thanks largely to госзаказу.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the Chairman of the Board "expert opinion" "Catherine Лезиной procurement community, today the state is the most effective customer.</seg>
<seg id="18">The pharmaceutical industry center deputy director of capital construction Vladimir Малахов Rosatom drew attention to the fact that the market can be divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and the company that owns монопольными competence and not allowing for this field of competitors.</seg>
<seg id="19">He believes that the creation of a transparent market is only possible when access to contracts will be as Turkey manager from someone's impact.</seg>
<seg id="20">Experts on the council was asked to create the system procurement in such a way that one and the same performer may not receive more than one contract worth more than 1 billion rubles, or several contracts worth more than 1 billion rubles.</seg>
<seg id="21">In минстрое believe that this approach must be evaluated from the point of view of the business impact, and effectiveness of construction management.</seg>
<seg id="22">As explained by Elena Zhukov, in this case, you will need to endow the functions, which will lead to an increase in the number of budgetary expenditure on its content.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the same time, the customer will have the knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by contractors, as well as their safety.</seg>
<seg id="24">Often with this Government, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the security of an object as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of highly skilled participants in connection with the state in obtaining state незаинтересованностью order for part-time work and a small amount of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="26">The deputy head of the Institute of procurement экспертно-консультационного Alexander Евсташенков believes that now the procedure volume turned into business to Scor contractor.</seg>
<seg id="27">And this example: "A participant when filling in the application must indicate" specific performance "without the words" or equivalent "," should "," "," "more," "less than," "similar" "or", "type", "type", not a "lower," "lower," "higher," "may," "could have," "may," "earlier" and "not previously," "higher," "not allowed" and so on.</seg>
<seg id="28">Thus, customers often abused their right to establish requirements for the content of the application of the contractors.</seg>
<seg id="29">Another problem, according to Евсташенкова 44-ФЗ, was the need to assess the quality of the application through the "paper" proposal.</seg>
<seg id="30">Looking at a proposal that actually can be assessed only qualified contractors, but not the quality of the work, the implementation of which has not yet even began, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="31">The quality of the works can be assessed only on their acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Experts on board was also asked to postpone a margin income from the top to the lower echelon to intermediate contractors disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="33">Chairman of the Expert Council, State Secretary, espionage FAS Andrew Цариковский believes that it is not worth it, as responsible for the order should генподрядчик.</seg>
<seg id="34">But otherwise, as in the famous репризе of Arkady Raikin normalises sleeping: "Пуговицам claims to have?"</seg>

<seg id="3">Since the 18th century buildings hardly changed, except ветхость.</seg>
<seg id="4">Strangers here, as people go on tour, and residents are more than delighted, from his privilege - the right to live in the house, the walls of which the Ufa старейшем remember commander Alexander Suvorov.</seg>
<seg id="5">The date of the house amongst others, historians point to the two dates - 1730 and 1737.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in any case, it turns out that the nearly 300 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The old yard, always open the door, the squeaky staircase.</seg>
<seg id="8">Doors in the apartments are located near each other, the chair covers were cracked walls and peeling plaster просветы places visible from the street.</seg>
<seg id="9">It seems that everything rests on honest word.</seg>
<seg id="10">But local residents are told: "You don't think it is."</seg>
<seg id="11">Live in a wooden house in the 18th century is very difficult, "says Tatiana (1961, a resident of apartment # 3.</seg>
<seg id="12">The object is to госохране, but its content was not allocated the money for dozens of years, and we feel museum exhibits, about which the authorities simply forgot.</seg>
<seg id="13">The last renovation was 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The walls still have great difficulties, but the foundation of the entire прогнил.</seg>
<seg id="15">Many residents still go to the toilet on the street SOR Shell Extension, and once a week in a public bath.</seg>
<seg id="16">How can we be satisfied under such conditions?</seg>
<seg id="17">The road passes directly under the windows, even a pedestrian zone.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tatiana dented curtain.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now see what before was only heard: Under the windows of the car rushes.</seg>
<seg id="20">You see, glass дребезжат constantly, can't open a window, and become accustomed to the noise.</seg>
<seg id="21">All the same, one gets used to the good and bad.</seg>
<seg id="22">Our apartment is still a top, thank you for your husband, he has golden hands.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, two of the three of us, we have to live with her son.</seg>
<seg id="24">And other families have the conditions much worse, no ceilings on the second floor of a little more than one and a half meters tall.</seg>
<seg id="25">In contrast to Tatiana offers guests the roommate out of the apartment, No. 6 Lyudmila Старостиной.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nice friendly woman with threshold offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile said:</seg>
<seg id="27">We have a studio apartment, 14.5 m ² for four people, and we live with her husband and daughter with his granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="28">I've been here from the birth of another boundary, has never been seen before, "Lyudmila обводит eyes 3028-IV room: Sofa, two of the letter" g "; one of them was the granddaughter with a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="29">Very closely and differs little from a domestic interior: Only ceilings, beautiful "historical."</seg>
<seg id="30">But with the ceiling regularly flows: Tap system worn.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lyudmila said about his apartment at the same time, as it routinely and globalization, the house which stands on Roman ruins.</seg>
<seg id="32">We have brought in one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:</seg>
<seg id="33">Water spent about 40 years ago during the last repair.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the same time, we have a small kitchen and bathroom in закутке from former self-struggles.</seg>
<seg id="35">We live just where квартировал Demidov family lived on the second floor of the servant.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our apartment is privatised, and why?</seg>
<seg id="37">In the real estate, the privatization say it does not matter.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still only get apartment, cannot qualify for more.</seg>
<seg id="39">Already four months ago, promised us расселить further promises, but it didn't matter.</seg>
<seg id="40">Not used and will not complain.</seg>
<seg id="41">In this apartment (room!) lived for an entire dynasty: My grandparents, mum and dad, my husband and I and my daughter with his granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="42">Things happened during that time.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, здоровенные rats ran in the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="44">Look at the walls of the outhouses, they one-meter wide thickness.</seg>
<seg id="45">They say the solution was involved in eggs, so long rests.</seg>
<seg id="46">The house built thoroughly Демидовым, thank you!</seg>
<seg id="47">Perhaps, but so far no one killed a crumbling battlement ceiling or сваей.</seg>
<seg id="48">Only a still slowly dying in front of us: Boards and logs, floors house гниют repeatedly failed, pouring cement, but all it takes is a solution to the earth, as well.</seg>
<seg id="49">They say, and is under our room the лаз and move to White, who had once lived here, the old Believers to hide from danger, in which case.</seg>
<seg id="50">Persecuted them.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lyudmila Старостина tells him came as a historian, he begged, he began to shoot in the flat excavations.</seg>
<seg id="52">And then urged to give them housing space in exchange for its однушку prospectus in October.</seg>
<seg id="53">Lyudmila historian refused:</seg>
<seg id="54">Where are we in однушку вчетвером?</seg>
<seg id="55">But even a tiny hope that there will be more public housing.</seg>
<seg id="56">We agree on the exchange, would not have won.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, the family Старостиных won nothing.</seg>
<seg id="58">The biggest dream of Lyudmila to Suburban Region, and one 16-year-old daughter with his granddaughter gave a separate room.</seg>
<seg id="59">The two families have identified two-room apartment instead of the majestic ruins, in which two generations living now.</seg>
<seg id="60">The girl was pretty, compact Olesya Карсакова flats from No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.</seg>
<seg id="61">There squeezed in two cramped totaling 23 m ², called apartments, lives with her large family.</seg>
<seg id="62">We just seven people, two children.</seg>
<seg id="63">See for yourself what conditions.</seg>
<seg id="64">Отваливается lumps of plaster and window frames, the walls in the kitchen, and the cross-cutting holes.</seg>
<seg id="65">The water in the кране only cold all year round.</seg>
<seg id="66">Walking about the house, the old apartments, you can see that the more fortunate of all spouses Lavrentyev apartment No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="67">They occupy the most spacious rooms of the first floor.</seg>
<seg id="68">You're right, places a lot!</seg>
<seg id="69">The 75 square, directed three people.</seg>
<seg id="70">We live just like in those rooms, where legend has it stopped the police during his stay in Ufa, the head of the family, "said Aleksandr Dmitrievich Lavrentyev.</seg>
<seg id="71">High ceilings, spacious.</seg>
<seg id="72">One is bad - everything is falling apart at the seams, is collapsing.</seg>
<seg id="73">Neighbors are probably already told.</seg>
<seg id="74">The more suffering we have with floors, wooden planks сгнили, literally went from under the feet of the ground.</seg>
<seg id="75">I put подпорки, wedges; yet nothing in the hall, and in another room, but on a seesaw качаемся, so all you can.</seg>
<seg id="76">The house merchant Евдокима Демидова Aleksandr Dmitrievich can tell you better than any guide.</seg>
<seg id="77">To золотопромышленнику refers to the native, speaks of it with admiration.</seg>
<seg id="78">Indeed, the personality and the owner was fantastic: Кагинского Узянского plants built houses, отливал guns and bells, kept Ural mines.</seg>
<seg id="79">Merchants take pride in an ancestor of real estate heirs, but live under one roof with history no longer want.</seg>
<seg id="80">I moved here as a kid, in the 1940s, in the 20th century, "said Aleksandr Dmitrievich.</seg>
<seg id="81">Then around wooden buildings stood in the stables entirely; there, and later снесенные.</seg>
<seg id="82">In 1968, wanted to remove, and our home, but something prevented.</seg>
<seg id="83">The same story was repeated again in 2014: Поманили new housing.</seg>
<seg id="84">We, as a team, and gathered all the necessary documents, обегали, and suddenly learned that moving into apartments in 2015 or 2016.</seg>
<seg id="85">Something already doesn't believe in all this.</seg>
<seg id="86">Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture in the Republic of Bashkortostan, to learn the fate of their homes.</seg>
<seg id="87">The occupier was not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="88">Sent from one desk to another, but then, as mockery, given without signing a piece of paper and printing: "The Ministry of Culture is not objecting to resettlement tenants."</seg>
<seg id="89">Even though I have a feeling that our house has long been not in terms of the city, because he was under the number 57, then became 57 A, now 57 / 1.</seg>
<seg id="90">As if he had already been demolished in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="91">"A planet" turned to the head of the land management sector informational-analytical resources Ufa Vladimir Барабашу.</seg>
<seg id="92">A house on the street of the October Revolution 57 / 1 is included in the program of settling the old housing.</seg>
<seg id="93">I cannot answer for the actions of officials in the 1970s, only know that at the time there was a plan for the demolition of old buildings, despite the historical significance.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fortunately, this wouldn't have happened, and the decision of the authorities is to rebuild the old house on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value, "successfully.</seg>
<seg id="95">Residents soon расселить planned for new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="96">According to Барабаша, House will restore Демидова Italian experts who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="97">Now in Italy, and the project is architectural Biennale "Old Ufa is there" among others.</seg>
<seg id="98">I hope that by 2016 all former Old Street will be on best Western Hotel Tigra was renovated, "said the official.</seg>
<seg id="99">Will the main house, which was earlier, three centuries ago.</seg>
<seg id="100">Демидова house, is likely to become a museum, open to all comers.</seg>
<seg id="101">In addition, the government decided to make pedestrian street at the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="102">On weekdays, unfortunately, don't get too much workload, the roads in the city.</seg>
<seg id="103">People from the future museum расселить Vladimir Барабаш promises in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="104">However, it is unlikely that they will be pleased with their new apartments will be of the same area that current.</seg>

<seg id="2">Never say, "I love you"</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was one of seven children born to a family of immigrants from Jamaica in Dudley in is in 1958.</seg>
<seg id="4">His father, who died when Henry was 19, he worked in a factory, and their relationship has been limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry репетирует comedy, "Rare records Rudi," which is partially based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of programmes on Radio 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mix of 199.4 and rap, and melodies - жизнерадостны.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, Henry had to get through some difficult memories of childhood.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the death of his mother was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often mused about the relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was very inaccessible.</seg>
<seg id="10">You've never seen his face, you only hear his voice: "Don't make noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Отстань from sisters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Шевелись!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch the cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were older, when I was a child, walked with him down the pub and talked about such things as a form of beer glasses, the beauty of the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">I have never talked with him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was so неулыбчивым guy in the corner, reading a newspaper which is a big part of my life.</seg>
<seg id="17">Henry recently opened литейную studio in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in the days of his father, he was able to look at what must have been his life.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now there's a little bit better, but it ’ s dark and the depths of Hell have дымные, with outbreaks of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father залезал in a bathtub and just lay there, and you have heard, as he slowly begins to sing about himself, because he wanted the отмыться mould from the studio.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I came back, I realised that he was doing this for years and years, to earn money for food, and I began to appreciate it more.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nevertheless, Henry came from a childhood devoid of parental love.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."</seg>
<seg id="23">It was only when her mother became ill at the end of her life, we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you.</seg>
<seg id="24">The birth of her own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love with which he lacked as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">You can stop it, "I love you"?</seg>
<seg id="26">Just don't hug me!</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I'm 22!</seg>
<seg id="28">With Don French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why would I not be friends with her?</seg>
<seg id="30">She was a great mother</seg>
<seg id="31">They are still great friends with the French, to whom he was married for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="32">Don is a good man.</seg>
<seg id="33">Why would I not be friends with Don?</seg>
<seg id="34">She's a great mom.</seg>
<seg id="35">Henry was the mother of the diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="36">He was one of what killed her.</seg>
<seg id="37">So, when I was very, very recovered and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take radical measures.</seg>
<seg id="38">Then I began serious training фитенсом, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="40">And that's boring.</seg>
<seg id="41">Nobody eats carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">A change of career trajectories of Henry reflected, perhaps, in his noble, briefly подстриженной beard.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he received the recognition for his critics of Othello, he completely immersed in theatre.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Mistakes" Комедия followed, and then "Заборы" Огаста Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">This work is different from sitcoms and comedies that were неотъемлимым attribute his busy professional life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He began his career, when he was 16 and worked in a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">Deejay remarked as he parodies on the stage, and wrote about it in "The new faces."</seg>
<seg id="48">His career in television began in the mid seventies: "Quite a long time I was the only black пародистом / comic on television."</seg>
<seg id="49">He was at work.</seg>
<seg id="50">I not only had to grow in the eyes of the public, I had to learn how to be an efficient vehicle for the delivery of jokes between 1975 and 1985, as a star, working on television, and it was very hard.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny in "New faces" in 1975</seg>
<seg id="52">As his manager had the right to "Black and white minstrels" show, light entertainment program, in which people "чернили face," Henry found that acting in it for five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">My family is a very disliked.</seg>
<seg id="54">I want to, like, this never happened to me, but I don't regret that I did it.</seg>
<seg id="55">Although it was strange, worthy of condemnation, I worked on large venues and learned to work the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="56">But what was the "which rewards light entertainment on British television classics for years and years," and was "grotesque, to black people."</seg>
<seg id="57">Introducing characters who were black culture in the UK, and her perfume, Henry worked in alternative комедийном project in the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="58">The first season of "Show Lenny Henry" was broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s, he was known as, among other things, the chef Гэрет Блэклок from the comedy series "Шеф!."</seg>
<seg id="59">Commercials, documentaries, television series and roles in the movies: The ten years of his life, but after his show on BBC in 2008 "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "what are you going to do next, Len, because little seems to be that you тянешь time or quietly сворачиваешь aside."</seg>
<seg id="60">Next was a series of documentary broadcasts on Radio 4 called "What's good for...?"</seg>
<seg id="61">The first was about Шекспире.</seg>
<seg id="62">I had a true allergy to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">One can't say that I really have been taught this at school, and I thought that it was, in many ways, a prerogative of white middle class people with колготками and cabbage at the bottom of the front.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I am very afraid of him.</seg>
<seg id="65">All who have we got an interview for transmission, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Денч said: "You need to try.</seg>
<seg id="66">Not ругай it as long as you don't know what you are talking about.</seg>
<seg id="67">24 aloud some of those words, and you will understand why we all love for Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry read from the last 20 lines a monologue by a Othello for the documentary, and his зацепило.</seg>
<seg id="69">I had the feeling that I can do it.</seg>
<seg id="70">Like my head выправили.</seg>
<seg id="71">"That's what it is, this is a serious case, Treat seriously in Vaduz, its text, a small study.</seg>
<seg id="72">So, the process of rehearsal was tough, and I read this play for months and months before we got her.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">It seemed that they had been waiting for disaster, but it never happened.</seg>
<seg id="75">Soon we began "Комедию mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I was at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you have changed."</seg>
<seg id="78">The technical problem arose, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the audience.</seg>
<seg id="79">"The Pacific voice inside me said: 'You have to work 10 minutes until they are computer operations."</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead, assistant director announced that view will resume as soon as the problem will be solved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I walked away from the scene and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."</seg>
<seg id="82">It's not my responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can't let someone else deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="84">"You play to play, stay in the role."</seg>
<seg id="85">In "Henry in the theater Дачесс заборах"</seg>
<seg id="86">Learn the "Заборов" was difficult.</seg>
<seg id="87">Panic is quite useful, she strengthens muscle.</seg>
<seg id="88">It was good, too, so it was like a sign showing: "Here's what you need to do."</seg>
<seg id="89">He says it is, of course, Громовым voice.</seg>
<seg id="90">So I держусь this.</seg>
<seg id="91">I really love it.</seg>
<seg id="92">I love being in the репетиционном hall.</seg>
<seg id="93">By the way, Henry still thinking comedian - all the way our conversation перебивают flashes his humor, when it begins, it ends the parody.</seg>
<seg id="94">I just decided not to work in стендапе, because this thing with instant gratification from a room full of strangers, I think, quite dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="95">If you want to do all the time, this can lead to a standstill.</seg>
<seg id="96">I sometimes work in "Прямом broadcast in Apollo, when I want, but, in the main, I don't get as much pleasure as before.</seg>
<seg id="97">I ask, would he give стендапа tour ever.</seg>
<seg id="98">The joy of sitting in a room with the director, who is helping to shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I ever wanted it to.</seg>
<seg id="99">This is his new incarnation?</seg>
<seg id="100">I think so.</seg>
<seg id="101">I like to be an actor.</seg>
<seg id="102">It's pretty fun.</seg>
<seg id="103">You always tell a story, and here is a great place for this.</seg>

<seg id="11">The pipes were trickling in defence were sitting motionless spiders, слизни left their footprints on all the windows, confident that the house belongs to them; зарос garden weeds, like giant кочаны cabbage.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was like a cottage from the book for children, while frightening and enchanting, with a garden full of secrets.</seg>

<seg id="14">The shortlist will be announced next week</seg>
<seg id="15">Кеверн Эйлинн and sat holding hands, broken sun loungers in the high grass, enjoying surprisingly warm spring day; they both "connected to the cheapest console, which provided the country music and appeasing 3-zmianowy news, when, glancing at her brown legs crossed, he remembered the old song long forgotten black performer, which he loved to listen to his father, she drapes in the house.</seg>

<seg id="23">"If it was a popular jazz pianist named Фэтс Уоллер," he told her, automatically placing two fingers to his lips.</seg>
<seg id="24">So did his father to stop the letter "J" before she слетит with his lips.</seg>
<seg id="25">It started with the game, in which they played when he was little.</seg>
<seg id="26">His father played in it with his father, as he told him.</seg>
<seg id="27">Start with "J" word, forgetting to put two fingers to his mouth, and it will cost you a penny.</seg>
<seg id="28">It wasn't a very fun game then, and it was not very fun right now.</seg>

<seg id="30">He had to explain what is jazz.</seg>
<seg id="31">Эйлинн has never heard.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jazz is playing, even though he was not explicitly prohibited.</seg>

<seg id="40">But at least he did not have to speak Эйлинн that Фэтс Уоллер was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">Given her age, it is unlikely that she remembered a time when popular singers were not black.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again, there are no laws or pressure.</seg>
<seg id="43">Society was docile, and this meant that each segment agreed with gratitude - the gratitude of those spared the fate of the group, with the principle of predispositions.</seg>

<seg id="48">Each according to his abilities.</seg>
<seg id="49">As she had heard only ballads Эйлинн was hard to understand how offensive words, who had just sung her Кеверн, could be laid on music.</seg>
<seg id="50">Music is an expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">"They're not really offensive," said Кеверн.</seg>

<seg id="80">Often cited his attempts to joke in the awkward situation, because, like his father, he was missing the soothing charm that could mitigate the cruelty, крывшуюся шутках in.</seg>
<seg id="81">Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.</seg>
<seg id="82">Maybe he, like Кеверн.</seg>

<seg id="89">He was feeling sorry for her because of the excessive brutality of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she gave him offside.</seg>
<seg id="90">Whether she thought that he was going to hurt her?</seg>
<seg id="91">She never talked to him about life on the cold northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that, in a fundamental sense, she was similar to здешнюю.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same huge icy ocean struck on both of them.</seg>
<seg id="93">The same used to be men, and even more sensitive and capricious after that happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened than their ancestors, smugglers and разрушители, shopped in fury from pub to pub, ready to raise a hand on any woman, or deny them посмевшую поддразнить them.</seg>
<seg id="94">Amounts to pointless head?</seg>

<seg id="98">Эйлинн Соломонз case showed that he needs to leave.</seg>
<seg id="99">He rose from the sun loungers, like an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She herself felt the lead weight, but the weight of his grief surprised her.</seg>
<seg id="101">This was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They barely knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">She looked, as he goes from an upper window and watched as he was leaving, her companion, the man himself to endure взваливший.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam, the garden, she thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">She felt a stab of sympathy towards him and men in general, even though some of them and raised her hand.</seg>
<seg id="106">The man, from the pulpit, отвернувшийся behind пристыженный сраженный, the ability to fight left him - why it seemed to her that she knew so well, if she could not recall a single case, until today, when she saw this?</seg>
<seg id="107">One Эйлинн Соломонз again looked at his feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">For more than twenty years before the events described above or so Esme cantered Нуссбаум, an intelligent and energetic 32-летняя исследовательница who worked in the "informal" Офнау Public Service control mood, has prepared a report on the low and medium levels of violence in those parts of the country, where it was expected that it would, if not end entirely, given the means and the forces that were allocated to its eradication.</seg>
<seg id="109">"A lot has been done, and a lot is being done," she wrote, "in order to allay врожденную aggressiveness of people who fought in a war and won most of them, especially among these спутанных branches and narrow расселин area, where, despite hovering over изгородями spires of churches, gentle breath of human kindness was rarely in history.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, some quality, it turns out, неискоренимы.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher, it would seem, the низменнее those passions that he зарождает.</seg>
<seg id="112">People shed sentimental tears over a skipping, drinking stories about преодоленных obstacles and announces its overheated belief in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness retains its strong grip as in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is evidence that a new depth and vile задиристость in homes, in the workplace, on roads and even in playgrounds.</seg>
<seg id="113">"You have досадная habit of writing too much," said her supervisor, read the report as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="114">It seems to me that you should read shorter novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">Esme cantered Нуссбаум lowered her head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask you: You атеистка?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I think that is not required to comply," said Esme cantered Нуссбаум.</seg>
<seg id="118">You lesbian?</seg>
<seg id="119">Esme cantered again insisted on his right to privacy and silence.</seg>
<seg id="120">Feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Again, silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I ask," said Luther Рабиновиц finally, "not because I am against atheism, лесбийства or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">Here we have no prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="124">We are the servants of society without prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="125">But some kinds of message, absolutely reasonable and a good in themselves, they may sometimes distort the results, such as those that you showed me.</seg>
<seg id="126">It is obvious that you yourself предубеждены against the church, and what you call "malevolent" and "rude", others would be interpreted as an expression of natural healthy and intensity.</seg>
<seg id="127">Continue нудеть about THAT happened, IF ANY ВООБЩЕ happened, as if it had happened, if anything happened, yesterday, it means depriving the country needed her life force.</seg>
<seg id="128">Esme cantered Нуссбаум огляделась on both sides until Рабиновиц said.</seg>
<seg id="129">Over his head, and pink, as 3D LED letters repeated advice that "Офнау gave the country" the last quarter of a century or more.</seg>
<seg id="130">His neighbour, улыбайся value of his spouse, listen ballads, we walk the talk on the phone, talk, listen, this fairytale, соглашайся, извиняйся.</seg>
<seg id="131">The conversation is better than silence, word of the song better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I fully understand that you want to say," said Esme cantered Нуссбаум quietly, when satisfied that her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I don't want to say anything, except that we have not subsided as efficiently as we convince ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">I am concerned that if we don't we are prepared, we find that repeat mistakes that initially led to ТОМУ ВООБЩЕ IF THAT happened, happened.</seg>
<seg id="134">Only this time we выбросим their anger and distrust the other.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Рабиновиц joined the tips of his fingers in a sitting.</seg>
<seg id="136">This gesture was supposed to mean the infinite patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"You go too far," he said, "calling" mistakes "actions that made or not made our grandfathers.</seg>
<seg id="138">You go too far and when talking about what they threw away their "anger" and "mistrust" in the "other."</seg>
<seg id="139">In your place, people should not need to: The fact that, in the past, the present, we are not talking about "us" and "them."</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "us" and no "other."</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of turmoil - that's about all we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"For that to be honest with ourselves," ventured into Esme cantered, "neither part of society could not well to justify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am not accusing anyone.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it was good or bad, what is done is done.</seg>
<seg id="145">Then it was back then.</seg>
<seg id="146">You don't need to say anything more - and here we agree.</seg>
<seg id="147">And don't blame anyone, not excuses, and if this was appropriate, or if it was something you can fix.</seg>
<seg id="148">But why past, if not to learn "</seg>
<seg id="149">Past Update to ensure that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I can add to that one word -</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther's Great Pyramid Рабиновица collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I'll review your report," he said, and dismissed her.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, on the way to work, she knocked a biker who rode on the sidewalk, passersby, described as "a vicious rage."</seg>

<seg id="2">Manufacturing growth in the eurozone slowed to the lowest level in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.</seg>
<seg id="3">The business index (PMI) for the eurozone manufacturing sector public fell to 50.7 in August, dropping from 51.8 in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">The above 50 indicates growth.</seg>
<seg id="5">New orders and businesses affected by the rising tension between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The meeting came before the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Markets will wait for the bank from a clear plan of how to cope with a recovery in the eurozone, as well as the threat of deflation, with inflation of just 0.3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi later this week may give further signals that he is contemplating scheme of quantitative easing in the eurozone, similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Although some growth is better than no growth, and the braking effect of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on producers are becoming more obvious," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at public.</seg>
<seg id="10">The manufacturing sector PMI in Germany, a major trade partner of Russia in the EU, has fallen to its lowest level for 11 months of 51.4.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the meantime, the bloc's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to an additional 46.9.</seg>

<seg id="15">One positive was news from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.</seg>
<seg id="16">Howard Арчер, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say about August survey index of business activity in the eurozone manufacturing sector, is that it shows that the sector is still growing," he said.</seg>
<seg id="17">He added: "Eurozone manufacturers, obviously, are finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension - particularly associated with the Russia / Ukraine, adds uncertainty still difficult conditions in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">This increasing tension, apparently hit by business - and especially on the confidence of consumers, and is likely to lead to the fact that some orders are delayed, or even cancelled, especially large orders.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said that "increasingly likely" that the ECB is, of course, in the end, you'll have to conduct some kind of quantitative easing, "although we suspect that it will be limited."</seg>

<seg id="58">But now he is afraid for such places as Ukraine, where war leads to a grief that he survived and his friends.</seg>

<seg id="72">And only one month has passed since then our nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="73">I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.</seg>

<seg id="75">Today in Ukraine a war, people are dying every day, and I think many children have been killed and killed.</seg>

<seg id="78">I just know that these people feel the horror of it.</seg>
<seg id="79">And I can't stop feeling it.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.</seg>
<seg id="81">Damir grew up and became very soft and quiet as a boy, he's not an aggressive and angry.</seg>
<seg id="82">He is not looking for revenge, for example, he did not just fixed on it in this last nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not like to remember it, but they are very close with six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and burn candles there.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember that as he lay on the couch, facing away from us, for hours on end.</seg>
<seg id="85">Did not sleep, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I also remember how he burned all his weapons and other military toys. Дамиру now 17, he was above me, nice, smart and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">To me it is hard to believe that a few hours I was so sure that he was dead, and that I would never see him no more.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I was able to recover from the explosion and rose to his feet, I огляделась hell, I saw around me, when parts of bodies were lying everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely convinced that it is not possible to my little boy could survive in this hell.</seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember that I shouted at him:" Damir, Run, убегай, "but again I was so sure that he had not heard me.</seg>
<seg id="91">But he heard, and ran off.</seg>

<seg id="117">This world is going to something very bad.</seg>
<seg id="118">"I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, and nobody wants a war, because it is happening?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing for this pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need to have a little bit of tens of years to forget it.</seg>

<seg id="122">About three or four years, I had nightmares because of the seizure, but now it became better.</seg>

<seg id="124">I thought about his friends and classmates he lost that were killed.</seg>
<seg id="125">That's why I continue to walk into the gym before every September 1.</seg>
<seg id="126">I want to pay tribute to the memory of my old childhood friends.</seg>
<seg id="127">I find it difficult to enter the gym, but I must do this.</seg>
<seg id="128">I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.</seg>
<seg id="129">I didn't forget about it, but I am not feeling sorry for ourselves.</seg>

<seg id="131">I graduated from high school this year and enrolled in the Medical University in Vladikavkaz.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'll learn to become кардиохирургом.</seg>
<seg id="133">My first choice was to go into the army.</seg>

<seg id="138">Incredible: George Фарниев was at the feet of террориста-убийцы during capture, but still he managed to survive</seg>
<seg id="139">During the seizure, however in the gym he was sitting next to a bomb at the feet of террориста-убийцы.</seg>
<seg id="140">Indeed, it is a miracle that he was not killed.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It seems to us that it was yesterday," says Giorgi, who wanted to learn from the intelligence officer in the Federal Security Service (FSB), but couldn't because of the damage that was caused his health at the time of capture.</seg>
<seg id="142">It's still with me, it's not something that I left behind.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am older now, and they say that children can easily cope with bad events, I must say that this is not true.</seg>
<seg id="144">"In 2006 I worked with psychologists, and I felt a bit better after that, but I can't forget it.</seg>
<seg id="145">And I'd like to forget.</seg>
<seg id="146">In 2005, the following year - was the first and last time, when I went into the gym again.</seg>
<seg id="147">I lost consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="148">I would never go there again, and, please, don't ask me to show, where I sat on this famous photograph.</seg>
<seg id="149">Person left alive: George Фарниев today with an open laptop on a photograph of herself in hospital after seizure</seg>
<seg id="150">My pain is enormous, and I carry it with me every day.</seg>
<seg id="151">My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about my school.</seg>
<seg id="152">With regard to the physical condition, I'm healthy.</seg>
<seg id="153">I need to be cautious with the knee, which was damaged, but now I walk normally.</seg>
<seg id="154">But health is not allowed me to go to study at the Academy of the Federal Security Service (FSB) in St. Petersburg, as I wanted to.</seg>
<seg id="155">I sent my documents, including medical reports, and they answered that it was impossible.</seg>
<seg id="156">My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.</seg>
<seg id="157">I had studied there for two years.</seg>
<seg id="158">He learns to treat all animals from cats to cows. "</seg>
<seg id="159">He said: "I know never to tell their children about their experience.</seg>
<seg id="160">It is not what children should know, and, of course, is not what they need to survive.</seg>
<seg id="161">His mother, Marina, 42, said: "The pain never leaves me.</seg>
<seg id="162">She's in my soul, and worse, when the anniversary is approaching.</seg>
<seg id="163">I will go and will attend the ceremonies, which will be held, to celebrate her.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know that George did not go.</seg>
<seg id="165">For him it should be even stronger, because he was there, and I don't.</seg>
<seg id="166">I was waiting for him at home and couldn't help.</seg>
<seg id="167">I am so grateful to God that he came back to me. Here in Beslan imprint lies on each.</seg>
<seg id="168">He remains with us.</seg>
<seg id="169">George, now an adult, but the nightmare was still with him.</seg>
<seg id="170">It's hard to take when something so terribly unfair, happens to you.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was a boy, he loves sports, but they can't do because of the knee.</seg>
<seg id="172">He had several operations, he can walk, but cannot exercise.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say that the 50 per cent he overcame this nightmare, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.</seg>
<seg id="174">This eerie experience will remain with us.</seg>
<seg id="175">Many of my friends and neighbors had been killed during the capture, and this only strengthens my pain.</seg>
<seg id="176">I lost a lot of people who I knew well and who were dear to me.</seg>
<seg id="177">My son with me, and this is the best gift that God could I do, but my heart aches for those who had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know the family, where the children were born, but I know and widows who never married.</seg>
<seg id="179">It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.</seg>
<seg id="180">I'll never forget how my heart out of my chest выпрыгнуло at that moment when I saw him in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="181">Now I look at what is happening in the world, "the war in different regions.</seg>
<seg id="182">These people are fighting for that?</seg>
<seg id="183">Why are they killing each other?</seg>
<seg id="184">The war very close to our country right now, and I can hardly believe it.</seg>
<seg id="185">We were a close-knit country in the past, how did it come about that we are fighting now?</seg>
<seg id="186">Men and children are suffering, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine, and many will be killed.</seg>
<seg id="187">If we could hold on to all rebels and throw away - far away, as soon as you can.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips, how to achieve a better quality photos and video underwater</seg>
<seg id="2">If you want to take photos or shoot video under water in front of you a whole range of options.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option - with "Point and Shoot," for example, the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or, for example, GoPro Hero3 экшн-камера + Silver Edition, both of which sold for about $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I took these pictures on a family holiday with the help of several cameras, all for the price of about $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">No matter what equipment you are using, you need to comply with several regulations, in order to achieve the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Перепроверяйте their equipment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the camera case and other branches tightly closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, the camera for the type of photos or videos that you shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">In some photos and video cameras filming or object type is regimes, or exposure to optimise underwater conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in the water, look at how deeply your equipment can fall.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are only 5 feet, others - 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Look at our leadership and the ratings of digital cameras for both traditional and catalog models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Remove a few frames - because many of them don't, you'll get.</seg>
<seg id="14">The point is, "" LCD that can help you take, then assign them as экшн-камер usually don't.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have LCD, it will be difficult to see under the water, and the layout of the frame is a random process.</seg>
<seg id="16">So do a few frames.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also, if your camera is shooting mode, which takes several shots with a slightly different plant, use them.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">Significantly reduces the amount of light, the deeper you нырнете under water.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, stay at the surface, when you're shooting in a swimming pool, a river or ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">It also allows you to transmit more colors in the photos; the deeper you get, the less you see color.</seg>
<seg id="22">Подплывайте closer to objects.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is a great tip for shooting on the land, but it is even more important under the water or due to the light conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is especially important if you're shooting on экшн-камеру: This equipment often comes with a fixed, широкоугольной lens, which means that you have to get closer to the object of filming, if you want to fill the frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was such a man, whose force of personality could shake things around, even in such a giant organization like the National Health Service.</seg>
<seg id="2">Консультирующий anaesthetist, he devoted his career as deliverance patients suffering from the illness, and from such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among those who spoke to him, recalls his wife, M16 officer who had to live with devastating effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that as long as Dr. passionate about being diagnosed and diseases, the treatment of those who are mainly concerned about something completely different - the pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, however, he appeared to those who suffer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I never felt, as usual," he wrote in May last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I found it hard to find strength in herself.</seg>
<seg id="8">Struggling with symptoms similar to flu, he found that his wife, Джулиет reproaches irritably.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want everything to happen sooner rather than later," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Джулиет left for a week, Lawson found that unusual and it is unclear why he was upset.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked a colleague to chest X-rays.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks before he went skiing in the French Alps in the Alps.</seg>
<seg id="14">Results of the X-rays came.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was mesothelioma, a terminal cancer, which affects плевру shell, or lungs.</seg>
<seg id="16">For most cancers, it is difficult to determine an exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although some people succumb to cancer of the lung, for example, not all sufferers of lung cancer smoked.</seg>
<seg id="18">But with mesothelioma differently.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, grainy construction material, who once called the "miracle," but which, as we now know, mortally dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us mesothelioma is a disease that you don't pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos, in the end, is the material from the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in the UK since the 1960s, when these industrial ban came into force.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even when it has been used, only people from specific sectors worked in close contact with him: Трубоизолировщики, builders, carpenters and 99 workers, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">Industrial toxin from another era, he hardly seems cause for concern today.</seg>
<seg id="25">But such a calm erroneously.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it turns out, is now at the peak of the epidemic мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="27">Here мезотелиомы dies from more people than in any other country on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="28">The annual death rate at about 2500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease than as a result of road accidents.</seg>
<seg id="29">The annual number of deaths from мезотелиомы since 1980 and projected in the future, the number of deaths in the UK</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason we feel its deadly consequences right now, lies in the fact that, although the use of asbestos and it is illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), for the development of мезотелиомы go usually tens of years.</seg>
<seg id="31">And attack мезотелиомы veterans specialties is not limited to industrial construction.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was, and is, in many cases, remains in the house where we live, where we work, offices, schools, shops, where we are and where we go shopping.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention in class, the level of income, profession or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">Избранности bastions, from fashion in London department stores to private schools, as it turned out, not salvation.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parliament building is riddled with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even hospitals that are designed to treat us, turned out to be reservoirs of this mortal a carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was not трубоизолировщиком.</seg>
<seg id="39">Strictly speaking, he had to think where he might have come into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he realized.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It seems that there could be a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital where I spent six years on an internship," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">All are students, nurses, doctors and грузчики - used these тоннелями.</seg>
<seg id="43">I wonder how many of my peers expect the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">It was a question to which, unfortunately, he was able to give a partial response.</seg>
<seg id="45">"From four doctors, which we in the hospital and who have subsequently Guy developed mesothelioma for the past five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I alone remained alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us expect this disease?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Лоусону was diagnosed with mesothelioma, "" when he was 48 years old.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">To live so long.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty percent of patients die from mesothelioma eight months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is always fatal.</seg>
<seg id="52">Thus, we can now only repeat Лоусона question: "How many of us expect this disease?"</seg>
<seg id="53">According to a leading expert on type in the UK, Professor Джулиану Пито, most likely assume that the years between 1970 and 2050, when asbestos is an epidemic in the UK, people will die about success.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most now are not that die that way.</seg>
<seg id="55">Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada telecentres are being set up</seg>
<seg id="56">A quick review of reports from the halls of the court, where victims are often seek compensation, shows how far it has spread to attack мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="57">In June, for example, Marks & Spencer acknowledged that included three Джэнис Ellen contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, apparel departments at two sites, one of which was the store on Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs Ellen was just 18 years old, when she started working at M & S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now her two children more than 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Before this happened," she says, "I had never heard about the type, I barely knew about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="62">And in my head I could not come, so that will affect me.</seg>
<seg id="63">Few people really know a lot about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="64">In fact, asbestos is not one substance, and a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">They get their name from the word "асбестиформ", which means the fibrous structure, which tells them the strength and flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="66">Of those six, three are often used in construction.</seg>
<seg id="67">Widely known as chrysotile, or white asbestos, is much more common in other buildings today.</seg>
<seg id="68">It has been used in roofing panels, outdoor thermal insulation, boilers, pipes and toilets, even in brake колодках cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">He смертелен less than other forms of asbestos, but still recognised by the European Union and the World Health Organization of "serious" damage to health that can lead to death.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, brown asbestos (амозит) and blue asbestos (крокидолит).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts have speculated that "there are good, though indirect reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with mesothelioma [in the UK]."</seg>
<seg id="72">An employee of the Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the main store on Oxford Street, London telecentres are being set up</seg>
<seg id="73">Джэнис Ellen might not have thought of themselves as a victim, but Julian Пито мезотелиомы work suggests that her story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that a significant percentage of мезотелиом when there is no known exposure at work or at home, were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment. "</seg>
<seg id="75">A large portion of this exposure, he says, is "normal" and the impact of weather on our building.</seg>
<seg id="76">No one, it seems, can't be sure that he is safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">The report Goddard Consulting, which was considered Вестминстерский palace, demonstrates how people, even in the heart of government, may have been exposed to unconsciously.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009, Goddard said that technical mines and pipelines for the premises of parliamentary committees were infected with deadly asbestos fibers, which can follow the movement of something as harmless as "strong currents of air."</seg>
<seg id="79">Members of the parliament often blame the fact that they are pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.</seg>
<seg id="80">Although the dish on the maintenance of Parliament insisted that Вестминстерский Palace received a "clean bill of health," and now she recognized that it is necessary to work on the £1 billion for the reconstruction of the parliament, by upgrading electrician and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, members of parliament, will meet in the conference centre nearby countries, and not on the green benches was.</seg>
<seg id="81">Goddard report noted that "the situation with asbestos do not manage in accordance with different rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">It is impossible to know whether this error management cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All we can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">One of those who could not identify their contact with asbestos, Graham is warming, general practitioner.</seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson, warming, 50 years, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I worked at the hospital, which has successfully brought claims associated with asbestos," he says, "But I can't prove this in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It's so hard to remember all the places where he worked, and dates.</seg>
<seg id="88">He remembers clearly the day in early December 2009, when his wholly overcame something that was like the flu.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and he was in the middle of an operation later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly the were shaken as me.</seg>
<seg id="91">It started very quickly.</seg>

<seg id="93">I thought I can't drive all the way to homes.</seg>
<seg id="94">The cost of being a doctor, knew that pain comes from, including checking for iframe loads, wrapping around the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="95">However, like Джэнис Ellen, he just did not have reason to suspect мезотелиому.</seg>
<seg id="96">Ultimately, he couldn't walk for a month.</seg>
<seg id="97">US doctors doing chest x-rays and put плевральные катетеры to pull fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis.</seg>
<seg id="98">And yet his condition оставлось without the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">Gradually, his health improved and he returned to work.</seg>
<seg id="100">But from time to time the same symptoms return, often after he was sports, and he breathed heavily.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, one of the patients came to him in Dubai office with similar symptoms, and he was later diagnosed with mesothelioma. ""</seg>
<seg id="102">Even then, however, the cost of not linked it with its own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">In the end, his patient was on ten years older and worked directly with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">In this case, the connection was obvious.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011, the state has worsened again in Dubai, and showed him his doctor консультировавший results of the CT and X-ray images of a group of experts.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, after exactly two years since warming began to feel ill, the sensor is equipped with a camera was put in his chest cavity between the shell and shell of his lung.</seg>
<seg id="107">I'm an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I usually just go further, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="109">I'm not too upset about it, to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife was.</seg>
<seg id="111">Biopsy results came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that it was mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham: Cost of mesothelioma diagnosis</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly sank in the cost of meeting with Macmillan nurses, one of which suggested he contact a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">It was then that he realised the scale of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turns out that asbestos was commonly used, especially in large public buildings, and where quite often there was asbestos thermal insulation systems on the planet," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, now succumb to the disease.</seg>
<seg id="117">Thus, mesothelioma now affects more young people, atypical professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous asbestos pipes isolated in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees who were on pedestrian tunnels connecting nearby landmasses can bring together to get from one building to another (as Andrew Lawson), or ate in the basements of canteens (how often did Graham warming) almost certainly really were exposed to toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">For several decades after the war, as it turns out, the hospital was a place where, in theory, life for поциентов legalistic, but the place, which constituted a threat to life for doctors who treated them.</seg>
<seg id="121">It still continues to remove today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students set their burners Бунзена asbestos on tap</seg>
<seg id="123">And it's not just hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and мэриях due to their amazing and огнестойких insulating characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="125">Schools too.</seg>
<seg id="126">Strictly speaking, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the classroom for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="127">Across the country, countless lessons in chemistry, students set their burners Бунзена asbestos on tap.</seg>
<seg id="128">The websites were tailored, focused on the problem of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as floor tiles or roof сараев typically contained asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"It's an industrial poison, in a huge number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Лоусона Guy in a case against the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case, the only contact that she could recall the woman was part of a garden shed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So be careful, снося garden sheds.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effect of the diagnosis, when we know that the disease is incurable, is huge.</seg>
<seg id="134">"To realize it, is quite a lot of time," says Graham warming.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to continue, but I understood that I couldn't focus on what I'm doing.</seg>
<seg id="136">I spent two weeks in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I realized that I had to go and deal with them.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I'm no longer a Christmas</seg>
<seg id="139">One of the most difficult things was the transition from doctor to patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">As countless patients before him, he remembers, was confused as the volume of information that should have been taken.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was difficult to understand," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked my doctor," How much do I have time? "</seg>
<seg id="143">Gave me about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember, as I thought, "Well, I will not be met by Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's all. "</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, as it is the mechanics of how we are in life, "the very act of breathing, raises cancer, which kills.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases are caused by contact with asbestos мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="148">Composed of tiny asbestos fibers.</seg>
<seg id="149">When asbestos is being destroyed and the carcinogenic fibers, they can get stuck in the lungs, плевре shell.</seg>
<seg id="150">Irritating плевру asbestos fibers and may cause cell mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem is due to the inhalation of asbestos fibres needle," Professor Tom Трежер кардиоторакальный, surgeon, who came to the hospital in 2001, Guy.</seg>
<seg id="152">The hospital, where the suspect, Andrew Lawson, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="153">Трежер Лоусона knew and treated some of the others who, perhaps, was exposed to while in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">When Sally Goodin Sally goodun Etc lyrics of asbestos in lung tissue, "says Трежер, breathing on them to unload periphery, where is the shell.</seg>
<seg id="155">It is, in its essence, invasive process from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="156">The usual treatment for other forms of cancer is much less effective in type.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, cause hot debate.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some think it's worth a try.</seg>
<seg id="159">Трежер disagrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">"You can't cut плевру," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">No good around her with a knife.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, this cancer chemotherapy is "not very well", which "acts", but not people.</seg>
<seg id="163">"From time to time there are patients who live for a long time," says Трежер.</seg>
<seg id="164">But ultimately, they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some patients are living much, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">Writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years later, after he was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years after diagnosis, Graham warming continues to fight.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he became ill from mesothelioma, Dubai introduced Andrew Лоусоном, which, four years after diagnosis, single-handedly turned into office support and consultation for these same patients.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Yes, Раковая Central," he said, cheerfully when they called.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," says the cost of operations.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was diagnosed with four years ago, and he still is very energetic.</seg>
<seg id="172">First Эбботту offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and would have prolonged his life only a month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was in despair," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, nevertheless, managed to somewhat more positive agenda. "</seg>
<seg id="176">The cost of meeting with several specialists, decided to continue treatment with Professor Лоиком Ланж-Лаздунски second, a professor of surgery at Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage in that I don't need it, I just called them and they took me," admits Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">The patient had to be consultants to get the direction and approval for funding.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money plays a pivotal role for patients with mesothelioma, to get the best available treatments.</seg>
<seg id="180">But when such treatments become ineffective, finally, inevitably, many patients still face with one financial reason for concern "about the future of the families that they would leave.</seg>
<seg id="181">And then they ask the courts for compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan, of Field Fisher Price Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It has been known that asbestos is harmful to health, in 1898," said Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But that changed in the 1960s, it became clear that even very small amounts can put their health at risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">It was then spoke about the bad faith of companies.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson, and Guy's Hospital, ultimately, resolve, but this was not "the full cost of the settlement," according to Morgan, as Lawson could not clearly prove that his mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation into his death, a spokesman for the hospital, Guy was confirmed, however, that "asbestos in its basement, mentioned above, was removed in the 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="188">It was too late for Andrew Лоусона.</seg>
<seg id="189">How to remove asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">In fact, tie a contact with asbestos to one company or place of work - usually through dozens of years after that, it turned out to be a big problem for patients with mesothelioma, demanding compensation.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have changed owner or shut down.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance archives could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who have protected from lawsuits, knows that time is on their side, plaintiffs have, of course, no.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, this year took serious new legislative acts which facilitate the process of recovery in patients with mesothelioma compensation, even if it is impossible to keep track of their former employers.</seg>
<seg id="195">In accordance with this law, was created £350-миллионный fund of funds, which is financed by the insurance industry, for those who have been diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove, but did not contact anyone with whom to sue.</seg>
<seg id="196">In such cases, patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in a case about the compensation of about £120,000.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful claims under this scheme is expected to be every year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with mesothelioma, believes that the £350 million represent a "very good work" for the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"This transaction, written by insurers for insurers," he says, hinting that the sum is a quarter of what insurers would have to pay, if it hadn't intervened time and patients with mesothelioma could track the company and file a lawsuit in the usual way.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even Mike Пеннинг, previously minister of labour and pensions, acknowledged that the law "imperfect."</seg>
<seg id="201">However, Morgan and Пеннинг and admit that, in view of the fact that seven people die every day, rapid action was needed.</seg>
<seg id="202">"People suffer so much, and they need help now," said Пеннинг during the second reading of the Bill about type in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">By the time Graham warming was in the hands of Professor Лоика Ланж-Лаздунски 19 months.</seg>
<seg id="204">After the initial consultation Ланж-Лаздунски recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Трежера, he believes to be effective.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was followed by radiation and chemotherapy -- тритерапия Ланж-Лаздунски, which boasts pristine 40 percent of patients surviving for five years.</seg>
<seg id="206">Warming felt a surge of strength.</seg>
<seg id="207">"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says the cost of operations.</seg>
<seg id="208">You see these patients all the time.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is a force that supports you.</seg>
<seg id="210">When сдаешься, condition can deteriorate very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham went to the cost of the operation in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">By the end of August he finished the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">The scan showed no trace of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I did a scan in March [2014].</seg>
<seg id="215">There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I just had to come.</seg>
<seg id="217">This is not a threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="218">This is the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="219">And again the cost went through six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now there is no trace of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="221">However, this process is both physically and emotionally heavy.</seg>
<seg id="222">You can think about practical things - about finances, and when I die, for example, or about the fact that we need to show his wife, works as a timer to бойлере.</seg>
<seg id="223">When you get bad news, become безрадостным.</seg>
<seg id="224">You just have to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="225">As a father, Ellie, 16, and 14 years old, it Тэмзин is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">"It's difficult for parents," he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose their leaders; protesters promise revenge</seg>
<seg id="2">China's parliament decided Sunday to not allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reforms.</seg>
<seg id="3">Such a move is likely to mark the beginning of long ago promised protests in Hong Kong as activists have begun planning and mobilization in a matter of hours after that statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the 11th National People's Congress, in fact, communist leaders to remove all the candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's not обмануло our expectations, but still leads in rage," said lawmaker Emily Лау, chairman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is not something that Beijing has promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">They lied to people in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defending the decision of China, Li Fey, Deputy General Secretary of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that to allow the public to nominate for the election of Hong Kong would be too "erratic behavior."</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing promised to allow residents of the region through a vote to choose the head of government, starting in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Sunday, Chinese leaders have taken the decision as a democratic step forward, since it gives a direct vote гонконгцам right; however, the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders continue to hold in his hands the process with the help of the Commission on the appointment of candidates, rigidly controlled from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, according to a new article that only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be admitted.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision was taken after the summer, when there have been some of the most large-scale and received widespread publicity the protests in Hong Kong for many years.</seg>
<seg id="14">For a large part of the campaign after Occupy Central movement in Hong Kong is With Love and Peace, which threatened to cut off the financial district in Hong Kong if Beijing does not guarantee of universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday evening, several hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="16">The demonstration, which organisers claimed that their movement is shifting to a new phase of civil disobedience and that they rise to waves of protest in subsequent weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, they have not reported the details, obviously, to avoid problems with government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In онлайн-заявлении organizers reported that the movement "to capture the central region обдумывало only as an exceptional measure, action that can be taken only if all the possibilities of the dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We regret to inform you that as of today, all the possibilities of the dialogue have been exhausted, and no doubt will be the central district.</seg>
<seg id="20">Authorities in Hong Kong were preparing to Beijing a few days, and on Sunday at the headquarters of the government had strengthened security measures involving police and barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">The unrest is the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their own city.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also intensifies the fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying that his demonstration to jeopardize the businesses - the lifeblood of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protest, which they say, it can lead to great economic damage, depending on how many people will participate, and for how long," said lawmaker Regina Yip, who has long been critical of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="26">We do not want to spread concern about the fact that Hong Kong can spin out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This view, which is harmful for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chinese state media also gave reports in recent days, in which the activists of the democratic movement in Hong Kong were shown диверсантами направляемыми, Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">Over the summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral law, which drew 780000 participants - more than one-fifth of voters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="30">In July tens of thousands came out to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists are raising questions of racial identity and behavior after Ferguson police</seg>
<seg id="2">Unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Фергюсоне, Missouri, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">(Raise your hands, chanting: "Hands up, don't стреляй" while they wait in line in front of the burial.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Missouri Фергюсоне, associated with the murder of teenager Michael Brown, change the blogger зоила Miriam Perez noticed the shift in интернет-разговоре among white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">In her experience, the white feminists, men comments put gender above race, when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, as the tension increased in the Midwest and attracted national attention, Peres saw the white women who is 100 percent focused on the race.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared with the reaction of black women shortly after the killing on 9 August, personal essays with such titles as "thoughts about Фергюсоне on behalf of white women" and "Феминизм is not only about угнетении women" appeared relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Perez, they demonstrated a significant shift.</seg>
<seg id="9">"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who are talking about white skin and privileges at such a high level," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People feel the need to say something about what has happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's very symbolic for the crisis with which we are faced, and because of the situation in Фергюсоне) is so tied to race, they feel that at this point.</seg>
<seg id="12">For a professor of English at the University of Ohio Кориты Mitchell Ferguson laid bare problems that blacks face every day, but one which is not perceived as a "women's problems" in the cultural sphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can write something funny on Facebook about what was going on with me and my partner and get 150 лайков from everywhere," says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">When I write something about how the colored people are attacked in my own country 's silence.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Why are women so publicly talk about relationships, but not about the security in the public sphere?" She asks.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women, like Mitchell, who studied questions of race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between matters relating to race and gender.</seg>
<seg id="17">From her point of view, blacks, women are in a position to clearly separate the problems; they are faced with a complex reality every day.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women now bring together issues of race and gender in feminist мейнстриме, Энджела Хэттери, a professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that its predecessor did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 1865 and 1890 линчевали for at least 10,000 black men, and it is almost always served as the rape of white women," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="20">The woman was white, Ufa, to substantiate the story.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the point of view of Хэттери, the gap between white and black women, while white registered, for example, Susan B. Anthony looked at the situation in the late 1800s, and saw that the fight for suffrage will be effective only for one of the groups: Women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They have decided to put all its eggs in a basket voting rights for women, and the right to vote for blacks was to appear later," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="23">To look back on things like this gives us a clear idea of why colored women don't trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We haven't done anything good.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to white women united against mob lynchings in the Women's Association for the prevention of mob lynchings in the South.</seg>

<seg id="28">Mitchell, from the point of view of the reactions of white feminists on the issues raised in the Фергюсоне situation, "the conduct of the police, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white a feminist had to" catch up "problems with whom blacks women cope in several generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"However, it would be great if a militant, which have such a [traditional феминистическая] ideology, so seriously would be to raise a child, as they relate to the right to contraception?" Asked Mitchell.</seg>

<seg id="33">Although Стайнем is responsible for more than пересекающийся feminism, which includes and problems of race and gender, her comments about race in America still fascinate some.</seg>
<seg id="34">The American entrepreneurial Institute researcher Christina Соммерс, author of "Who stole feminism?" Said Leven, The People, that young men of color in the United States, especially young people, "is much more vulnerable than their sisters," but Стайнем Фергюсоне contradict the negative criticism, which she expressed earlier.</seg>
<seg id="35">We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for the boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, when the White House recently initiated a program "Сторож, my brother," to help the vulnerable black and испаноговорящим changed remarkably young men, followed the reaction from many feminists, including from Gloria Стайнем.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Ministry wants to accelerate the growth of the electric vehicle market</seg>
<seg id="2">This week the Ministry of Economic Development will make the government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally clean transport in Russia, deputy director of the ministry, Oleg Плужников told the round table that held a Moscow's Vedomosti on 2 July, 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">The plan drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals - reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is expected that the document will be passed in late September, early October, "says Плужников proposed measures concern the development plan for the development of electric cars and hybrids - vehicles on газомоторном fuel in Russia already have.</seg>
<seg id="5">(A copy of the plan obtained by Vedomosti is designed for 2014-2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">Evaluation criteria will develop hybrid electricity and transport, and to decide how to promote the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">The government report, which will be described in the tax and customs support measures for years, will be prepared by December 2014; the concessional lending and leasing will be introduced by April 2015, and proposals to reduce prices, stimulate the creation of infrastructure and service will be developed by October 2015</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014-2015, is expected to make changes to regulations to ease conditions for the construction of the infrastructure charge (parking, petrol stations etc.).</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, federal officials plan for 2015 to formulate proposals for regional authorities to also promote the use of environmentally clean transport - in the form of giving him the benefit of the movement and parking, for example; and at the end of February 2016 - and proposals on the expansion of the government purchases of such transport.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, the Ministry of Economic Development by October 2014 will bring in a list of indicators to assess the regional authorities of criteria that reflect the effectiveness of support production of environmentally clean transport, the development of the infrastructure charge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Electric vehicle market in Russia, while only formed in 2013 across the country sold around 100 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the beginning of 2014 обнулена an import duty on electric cars, so sales will be approximately 500 pieces, predicts CEO Andrew Pankov Mitsubishi Motors in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="13">But Baltsi growth does not make any noticeable: Electric cars in Russia in 2013, according to the Association of European Businesses, sold 2,78 million cars and light commercial vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="14">Russia imports until the Sunderland only Mitsubishi Motors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Start import preparing Renault - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says director for strategic planning and partnerships in Russia Renault Nicolas Ремиз.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most other manufacturers of electric transport took in relation to Russia is taking a wait-and-see approach.</seg>
<seg id="17">Development of electric cars and from Russian manufacturers GAZ directors "," ",", "but the trivial.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in January - July 2014, according to the "АСМ-холдинга," Avtovaz released 30 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="19">Modest demand due to cost, admits director of AvtoVAZ engineering Sergei Аманов, without state support the breakthrough in this segment will not.</seg>
<seg id="20">The development of the Russian market in electric cars (in addition to the cost of the electric cars that are sold in Russia, on average, twice as much as rivals with internal combustion engines) is an underdeveloped infrastructure charge (retails sites - units), "sighs Автостата CEO Sergei Целиков.</seg>
<seg id="21">Because of the soaring prices and low rates of reducing the cost of electric cars in the next 3-4 years remain нишевым segment of the Russian market, predicted "Авторевю editor-in-chief Mikhail Подорожанский Целиков, agrees with him.</seg>
<seg id="22">Car manufacturers, in contrast, say that some models are already close to the cost of a conventional vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Russian vehicle market prospects, the important thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "real" электромобильность; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of the new charging stations, president of BMW's Wolfgang Шлимме.</seg>
<seg id="24">Such infrastructure projects, for example, sells "Россети госкомпания": In Moscow built several stations soon will have another 80.</seg>
<seg id="25">Talks about building a network of retails sites are being carried out with other regions.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to the director of the department "Россетей Vladimir Софьина, the company believes the market is ready to build electric and gas stations across the country, but there are also problems: A small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric cars of various brands.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, "Россети" as network the company does not have the right to engage in the sale of electricity, the ability to do this in relation to charge electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="28">Wife believes the most effective measure of state support for vehicle market in Russia progeSOFT customs duties.</seg>
<seg id="29">Zero rate will act before the end of 2014, its renewal and expansion of the preferential list.</seg>
<seg id="30">Replacement transport tax on ecological (the idea is being discussed and concerns all cars) also support the market, but not as noticeably as customs preferences, said Pankov.</seg>
<seg id="31">Tax in Russia is small, said Pankov, unlike, for example, from Norway, where the reduced tax rate led to a sharp increase in electric sales - now they account for 12% of the market.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, and the need for stimulus measures, such as free parking in the city centre (as has been done in Moscow), I am sure Pankov, or any vehicle travel on dedicated lanes, which are not yet in Russia.</seg>

<seg id="6">On the night of August 29, the White House said that President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel to discuss imposing additional sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The weakening of the ruble is long-term in nature and, in tandem with the euro, and in tandem with the U.S. dollar.</seg>
<seg id="8">The long-term forecast assumed that mark, "says senior analyst" par "Anna Bodrov's.</seg>
<seg id="9">All of that has to do with Ukraine, one way or another will be reflected on the courses.</seg>
<seg id="10">As long as this continues, investors will react.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, rumors about the invading troops not confirmed nor on the one hand, but the market was very emotional.</seg>
<seg id="12">All the talk about the fact that he has been stable for such news, yesterday were перечеркнуты.</seg>
<seg id="13">A week, according to specialist, will be closed around these levels, and the ruble 36,90 37,05 per dollar.</seg>
<seg id="14">The tax period ended, oil prices, weak policies, sanctions, the problem of transit of natural gas through Ukraine are all links in the same chain.</seg>
<seg id="15">The forecast also said current prices for inflation to fall by end-2010 from 5 to 10 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon, the same end, seasonal vegetables and fruits, and there will be a vacuum, so long as the network переориентируются on other suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The dollar went up to 37 rubles, passed it and came back, some powerful hysteria," said the head of the department of analysis of markets "Opening Broker" Konstantin Bushuev.</seg>
<seg id="18">Still, will look at whether to impose sanctions on Saturday promised, as will meet NATO.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to him, the ruble weakened sharply after the tax season, then went to Ukraine, by the same token, the Central Bank said last week that, until the end of the year moves to a floating exchange rate and waives any currency interventions.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you look at the daytime wobble, it is no different from the previous ones during this month, all have spooked that mark in 37 rubles, "continued the analyst.</seg>
<seg id="21">And so, in terms of turnover, nothing has happened.</seg>
<seg id="22">Troubling times for the currency market, I would like to remind you that at the end of January, when an increased demand for the currency, as well as 3rd March, when the Central Bank отгрузил a record number of currency.</seg>
<seg id="23">To see the positive side of the UFS IC and weakening of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="24">First of all, this is the revenue part of the budget from the export operations, as well as improving the competitiveness of domestic manufacturers at the expense of more expensive imports, "says chief analyst UFS IC Alexei Kozlov.</seg>
<seg id="25">Negative moments can be attributed to the cost of imported goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency to significantly reduce the attractiveness of the investment in the Russian economy, provoke increasing inflationary pressure and, as a result, become more expensive for borrowing funds which, in turn, slows down the development of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="27">If we talk about the stock market, the rouble devaluation smoothes over a decline in stock prices, expressed in roubles.</seg>
<seg id="28">For example, the MICEX index during trading Thursday fell 1.67 per cent, while the RTS Index lost 3.27 percent.</seg>
<seg id="29">Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of reduction of indices due to a weakening of the ruble during the day more than 1.5%.</seg>
<seg id="30">The weakening of the ruble is an emotional character and can be explained by a desire to buy the currency.</seg>
<seg id="31">In practice, gradually go on emotions, and quotes the ruble partially or fully restore some lost ground.</seg>
<seg id="32">"We believe, soon we will be able to see the value of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles to the dollar," said Alexei Kozlov.</seg>

<seg id="2">Восстанавливающаяся economy means more customers, the more sales and jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Account for taxes on the state and local level for companies across the country, moderately increased in the past year, when the recovery accelerated, according to a new study, published last week, and the company in the Washington area is no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion in the coffers of the state and local level in fiscal 2013, to 3.8 percent more than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tax burden on business in the state and local level in the past year rose by 4.3 per cent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after years of going after each other, smaller, bank accounts in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">State taxes, rose 4.3 per cent, faster than the local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to the research, which was conducted by professional services firm, Ernst & Young and the Center on taxation, the tax policy.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of tax revenue in the county, 56 percent in taxes on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of tax revenue for Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the amount of tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="10">To a large extent, is caused by the growth of tax revenues return to the same level of the value of real estate companies, researchers say that raised property taxes by 3.7 per cent this year, after three years in a row, when growth was less than 1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large proportion of these revenues are concentrated in big states such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same thing is happening in the Washington area.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion property taxes in the state and local level in the past year, to $9.6 billion more than in 2012, an increase of 4.2 per cent, compared with the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the cost of the return on property does not have a similar effect on the growth of tax revenue for the state and local level in Maryland, where property taxes are unlikely to exceed one-fifth of companies' tax bills.</seg>
<seg id="14">Virginia and the District of Columbia pay tax accounts for about half of the state and local level, in the form of taxes on real estate.</seg>
<seg id="15">"What is happening in Maryland is that such a large part of its property tax base, particularly around the District of Columbia, is owned by either the government or nonprofit organization that does not pay property taxes," said Douglas Линдхолм, executive director of the Center for State taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, Maryland had to rely more on, for example, income taxes to pay for those services that exist in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent increase in tax receipts from businesses cannot fully explain the recovery of the real estate market.</seg>
<seg id="18">Income entrepreneurs also seems to go for the amendment, according to this data.</seg>

<seg id="4">Their debut album, Leif is still several months before release received 100,000 предзаказов contract, but the issue lies in the portfolio will Warner Music.</seg>
<seg id="5">Given the present situation on the market, a musical плачевную situation of lambasted, because here we are not talking about new Lana del Ray, or another сладкоголосом representative of a "new R 'n' B ', and about the appearance of the British duo быковатых, playing with the level of volume and intensity, that the last time was in vogue a couple of decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">In general, rates on the first album in connection with all вышеозначенными circumstances were especially high and it is quite justified.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is no coincidence that the duo took his name, which previously could prejudice isn't really that desperate hairy metalheads, which kings and blood flows, as they think, they have in the veins, too.</seg>
<seg id="8">We are talking, of course, primarily about the heroes of the past, like Led Zeppelin and the great quartet, Royal Blood aim to shake застоявшуюся blood British rock, taken it to a new level.</seg>
<seg id="9">To make predictions about the success of this enterprise until, perhaps, exactly, but something we can say already.</seg>
<seg id="10">A dozen songs, уложившихся in thirty minutes with people is not so much a demonstration of the phenomenal композиторского gifts, how geography and a powerful statement of intent.</seg>

<seg id="14">But the truth is that each of these songs would sound great at a party heavy rock fans, but when playing in a row they merge into a more or less uniform.</seg>
<seg id="15">And this is not necessarily bad, on the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Royal Blood in the fact that they do not claim the new Lucile Lennon and McCartney (that mark), but the successors Motörhead have numerous рок-дуэты инди-клубов from the ghetto.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their music, despite some variety, created for stadiums, indoors, apply less than a couple of thousand people, she is obviously closely.</seg>
<seg id="18">The secret lies in хитром using bass guitar, the man in the usual format, придуманном zero at the beginning of the White Stripes.</seg>
<seg id="19">However, it is not only the instruments, but also in the approach to writing songs.</seg>
<seg id="20">Zero heroes ретророка выбирались with great difficulty outside of postmodern paradigm, with huge reluctance to admit to itself not just эпигонами and independent creative units.</seg>
<seg id="21">Royal Blood is now sound so heavily and boorishly that this pressure successfully драпирует some вторичность твердолобость and musical material.</seg>

<seg id="2">Amazon has just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: Shopping online - and видеопродюсер, and a hundred other things - streaming видеовоспроизведения service it bought for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).</seg>
<seg id="3">The news was not a surprise because no one expected that it would be sold, but because many people expected that YouTube will be a buyer.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago it is selling a billion Google видеосервису looked completely finished, and this combination was a natural.</seg>
<seg id="5">It is based on just three years ago as Justin.tv, set a goal to be потоковым general service "version of YouTube in real time.</seg>
<seg id="6">Instead, he quickly became a platform where gamers aired after their moments; "YouTube for games in real-time," according to Business insider.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is the interface.</seg>
<seg id="8">And the "pay for play" genre "videos, in which всезнайки give (mainly old) games, as in" Таинственном theatre ", already popular on YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="9">The fact that YouTube is mentioned often, when you describe it, so the news that YouTube acquires it was without much interest, a classic example of new technology companies, выкупающей potential competitor.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's a mystery why deal with YouTube has failed, given that, reportedly, he was willing to pay, no less than Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">All that we have at the moment is a statement from CEO Emmett Шира it: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term objectives, and they want to help us reach them more quickly."</seg>
<seg id="12">Another mystery, frankly, it is an incredible success it is.</seg>
<seg id="13">Снобам like me, who say they would rather exercise than watching him, it is difficult to understand the attraction to watch the game, instead of himself to pick up a joystick.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is one thing - to look over his shoulder at 3 a.m., when other creeping through the resident Evil, and quite another to watch as an outsider, a man gets 20 shots in the head in a row as Call of Duty.</seg>
<seg id="15">All of the games that you could watch right now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are designed for one person, so to watch them shoot, not controlling the angle of view, it can be a headache, a worthy Do It Right.</seg>
<seg id="17">I agree that high-speed transmission, in which our electronic age Роджеры Бэннистеры round out the whole game in record time, entertain.</seg>
<seg id="18">But if we are not talking about виртуозе games or humor, it's unlikely that his channel, it will be interesting at all.</seg>
<seg id="19">But they know that skeptics like me?</seg>
<seg id="20">It had 55 million unique visitors per month, and it is the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.</seg>
<seg id="21">How Amazon works on this?</seg>
<seg id="22">It is hard to imagine that it свернется in Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube could just swallow it.</seg>
<seg id="23">But it is something that will be happy to have received any company: The crowd of young men, of whom dream of advertisers.</seg>
<seg id="24">As it is, said head Шир Amazon and it is "both believe in the future of gaming," and the channel is showing no signs of decay, even "ouch" as a kind of sport.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cunning ways to save on university textbooks</seg>
<seg id="2">In view of the fact that the cost of university textbooks for many students more than $1000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who soon after for a second course, came up with an ingenious way to cut costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">He developed a system of how to take the books in the world, offering them старшекурсников nominal compensation that they delayed their sale.</seg>
<seg id="4">"My textbook on mathematical analysis, which typically costs $180 for a semester, I got $10 and biscuits" Chick-fil-A "," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying in Ковенант College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The literature on the cost would be $430 last semester, he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He spent $120.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the Council, the average college student spends more than $1,200 a year on books and supplies, but the students have a number of options to reduce these costs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Students are increasingly choosing online and creative ideas, such as the system ’ s.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rent books is becoming more and more popular, allowing students to use the book for the semester and is often significantly cheaper than buying them.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Нибо Инкорпорейтид", which holds more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of rental books has doubled since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">Industry studies show that about a quarter of books in university book stores during the past spring semester were taken, said the vice president "Нибо" Trevor Meyer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fewer than half of all books sold in university book stores, according to the National Association of the professional association of university shops. "</seg>
<seg id="13">Here's introductory course on the best ways to take a great deal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Buying online store</seg>
<seg id="15">Sometimes, if you'll come out with a new book on the Internet, the cost could be one-third from the one that you'll see in the university bookshop.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis," Ron Larson ’ s Bruce Edwards and Robert Хостетлера worth about $290 privately, but a copy can be purchased for $239,99 site Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Buying used</seg>
<seg id="18">If you don't mind other people's notes or damage, second-hand textbooks is a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Mathematical analysis" sold for $93,49 подержанном on to Chegg.com.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Кэсэдей, 25 years later, a fourth year student at the University of Бригэм Young, said that paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for the textbook used copy of "strategic decisions in the media: An understanding of the business side of the advertising business."</seg>
<seg id="21">The book sold for $48.</seg>
<seg id="22">Teachers, for instance, Ingrid Брейси, director of "without walls" College at the University of Massachusetts in Эмхерсте, offers to students with their professors, could use the previous editions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates are insignificant for classes.</seg>
<seg id="24">In such cases, the old editions can often be found in a very small fraction of the cost of the last edition.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition to websites Amazon and Chegg, Half.com, "owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying second-hand books.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hire</seg>
<seg id="27">About to rent textbooks, you need to think, if you're well enough with them, don't forget to return them and don't want to leave them alone after the course is completed.</seg>
<seg id="28">You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, a student could rent a "Математический analysis" for a semester for about $20.</seg>
<seg id="30">To find out the rules to a store where you take books, including any fines that you can write a check for, and the damage.</seg>
<seg id="31">If you take a book, remember: If you don't book, upon fines may even exceed the cost of the new instance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Electronic books</seg>
<seg id="33">Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks is another option.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sometimes such books actually take a purchasing electronic license for a certain period for retailers, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Mathematical Analysis" rental site Chegg.com for six months will cost about $61.</seg>
<seg id="36">Брейси says that students who study literature, can often find the most advantageous prices, as many of the classics, you can now add, whereas literature on natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.</seg>
<seg id="37">No matter what, осмотритесь.</seg>
<seg id="38">Joe reports, 29 years old, which is going to begin studies at the Law School Пеппердин, recommends use ISBN numbers to find out prices for the book, because it ensures that you are looking for precisely the right you text.</seg>
<seg id="39">Before the Internet, says reports, be sure to check whether a book is in stock.</seg>
<seg id="40">To him this lesson Hemsedal is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="41">The book, which he bought, was postponed for four weeks, and, in the end, he paid the full price at the university bookstore.</seg>

<seg id="56">In restaurants with mixed cuisine are starting to replace dishes, for example steak from marble beef - on бефстроганов, says Sergei Mironov.</seg>
<seg id="57">"Cheeses from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian cheeses and cheeses from Serbia, Chile, Argentina, Tunisia," lists the "East-West" Oksana Глибчук.</seg>

<seg id="9">Parameters laid out in draft guidelines that are designed to eliminate this obstacle to implementing "европротокола" in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to them, the maximum payout for Marine in connection with the accident, without the police, must not be lower than the limit for "европротоколу."</seg>
<seg id="11">But at the same time, it may not be higher than the limit specified in the agreement, Marine insurance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The idea, of course, useful and theoretically capable of relieving both Smith and roads.</seg>
<seg id="13">But, more likely, it does not come to any motorists, nor insurers.</seg>
<seg id="14">The last now talk about a serious threat to the growth of the fraud, which can result in the introduction of new rules on payments Marine.</seg>
<seg id="15">As for the drivers, it is difficult to imagine what kind of work will have to be done to overcome as Russian conservatism.</seg>
<seg id="16">In most cases, the driver would be hours to wait for the inspectors to make small accident, because more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="17">And it remains to be seen, that it will be easier -- or to convince drivers to win swindlers "европротокола reliability."</seg>
<seg id="18">Savings certificate makes personalised and irrevocable offer</seg>
<seg id="19">The Ministry of Finance wants ban on bearer savings certificates, but will allow banks to do their own version of the безотзывного contribution.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Finance Ministry is preparing a bill that would prohibit savings certificates to bearer.</seg>
<seg id="21">Lately, this tool is gaining popularity, as rates here are higher than on bank deposits.</seg>
<seg id="22">The fact of the matter is that savings certificates for the system of deposit insurance and the Bank are cheaper because they don't have to make payments to the Fund Deposit Insurance Agency (pointed out).</seg>
<seg id="23">Successfully situation in the fact that this step will be taken because of the small and medium-sized banks, spreading such certificates, and suffer from Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which is estimated to control pointed out that 98% of the level of the market.</seg>
<seg id="24">With the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, which is about 3.5%.</seg>
<seg id="25">The problem, pointed out, the explanation lies in the fact that a small bank customers, who bought such a certificate, in case of withdrawal of the license is trying to get money from him in pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and purchase of bearer savings certificates, may assume that their investment is insured.</seg>
<seg id="27">The absence of reasonable insurance payments on these certificated in case of license revocation the bank can lead to misunderstandings and social tension.</seg>
<seg id="28">In practice, agencies were cases when holders предъявительских certificates to seek indemnities through the court, "he said in a pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="29">The problem, of course, made-up.</seg>
<seg id="30">The certificates pay buyers still nobody will, because under the law they have no right to compensation from the State.</seg>
<seg id="31">If this was in fact an instrument that is insured in pointed, together with him and would have banned metal accounts, which means citizens are in grams of one of four metals: Gold, silver, platinum and palladium.</seg>
<seg id="32">Since these accounts do not fall into a system of deposit insurance, but their existence as long as no one takes.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is likely that the bearer certificates are very convenient security, which may actually act as квазиденег.</seg>
<seg id="34">With almost no control of their movement: Any bank customer can buy a certificate to any citizen, and I was such a certificate can change a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is no coincidence that the draft that savings certificate must be personal security, which must be stored in depositories.</seg>
<seg id="36">But to one that allowed banks to issue such certificates without the right to early repayment.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have introduced similar безотзывного contribution, which has long been the dream of the bankers.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the highest level talks in Minsk is not decided, for the sake of problems which were called back, but gave rise to a new format: The first person in the European Union, met with the chief executives of the Eurasian future</seg>
<seg id="3">The disturbing drift and let the (the situation around Ukraine отлагательств does not tolerate), the leaders of the EU and of the Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of "hot issues."</seg>
<seg id="4">Whether or not this structure can work effectively, it is not clear; but it is clear who took the cream from that summit.</seg>
<seg id="5">Questions on this one evening on August 26, when the Belarusians, and followed them and other евразийцы with Europeans saw a television news report about the new President Lukashenko.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Belarusian leader revealed an example of polished talent, this was the behaviour of a man who had just caught the jackpot - and is planning a decent old age in high society.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Maidan Lukashenko helped</seg>
<seg id="8">Arrival in Minsk at the three main European commissioners (EU) ministers, who met Lukashenko and allowed him to play in the final briefing on their behalf -- not just легитимация president for the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is the subject of an application for recognition of a full European policy and the main медиатором Ukrainian crisis.</seg>
<seg id="10">A senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Studies Denis Мельянцов sure: From Brussels would not have to talk to Minsk in the same tone as before.</seg>
<seg id="11">"What Catherine Ashton met face to face with Lukashenko, gives reason to believe that the relationship with the EU will be размораживаться and beyond," he said "Огоньку."</seg>
<seg id="12">This is the hidden part of the iceberg: Preparing to push the Belarusian authorities began long before November Maidan in Kiev - summer 2013-го.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The results have been achieved and the EU is the successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues about modernization," transfers "Огонька interlocutor," and with the United States were held talks on international security.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even some States removed sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="15">As regards the Ukrainian events, then they themselves and the response to them have only invoked another influx of this process.</seg>
<seg id="16">Minsk, on the other hand, managed to preserve relations with Ukraine are warm, not much to lose in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for talks.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other hand, the leader of the Senate, which is not recognized by Russia's annexation of Crimea and urged to punish pro-Russian militia in the Donbas with the severity, and quarreled with Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="18">Minsk came from neither the Customs Union nor from the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), and placed in a Russian air base.</seg>
<seg id="19">Brussels and Washington have noticed a balanced position on the Ukraine issue in Minsk - and appreciated her confident Belarusian experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">How successful will be Lukashenko's political movement to diversify, will be seen as often in the near future, the meeting in Minsk should accept EU format + TC.</seg>
<seg id="21">The press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy Catherine Ashton and diplomacy have failed to answer questions about what Brussels wants from the relationship in a new format.</seg>
<seg id="22">A spokesman for Ashton said only "Mayan Косьянчич Огоньку" that decisions on issues of war and peace, this issue is not a priority.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the same time, there were reports that following a meeting on the Ukraine issue, with the participation of the people in the new format may be, and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="24">A drop of tar in Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that about him, it turns out, personally asked the representatives of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nevertheless, the final briefing Alexander Lukashenko made it clear: All sides don't mind that Minsk has remained the central platform for meeting both Россия--ОБСЕ--Украина format, and at the level of Heads of State and high representatives of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="26">This means that "the last dictator in Europe" рукопожатного acquires the status of a European leader who helps solve a global problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">The European farmer's best friend</seg>
<seg id="28">Already the EU delegation included еврокомиссаров on trade and energy, pushed to the conclusion: The main underlying reason for the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbas, and economy.</seg>
<seg id="29">In fact, сверстанное meeting schedule future negotiations on the supply of gas and to overcome fear of the CU in the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU looks more robust than the achievement of peace declaration without specific dates and numbers.</seg>
<seg id="30">Trade Commissioner Karl De Гюхт, nevertheless, indicates EU representatives: "Arrived in Minsk seek solution to the political crisis which has economic consequences, and not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="31">It seems, however, that the economy and the crisis in Ukraine "works" in Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its consequences - and primarily mutual Western sanctions and Russia - Minsk, who himself feels санкционное pressure until the room for maneuver.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to the leader of the Mises Research Centre, the presidents of Belarus Yaroslav Романчука, European investors are actively interested in opportunities in Belarus for supplies of agricultural products to the Russian Federation in bypassing sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the same time, supplies are schemes, for which President Vladimir Putin at the summit пожурил Minsk.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Billions of these schemes," said Romanchuk Огоньку "," are not the Belarusian businessmen and Russian companies.</seg>
<seg id="36">They practised scheme for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Russian businesses urgently need to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of the Belarusian authorities.</seg>
<seg id="38">The second story, "the expert continues," is linked to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not averse to maintain production in Belarus of raw materials as well as focusing on the Russian market.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Ukrainian producers about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and the Belarusian производственно-торговые scheme now could be very popular. "</seg>
<seg id="40">According to Романчука, the role of the host site for the negotiations, the EU and the TC is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of the development of economic ties with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="41">He recalls that the loss of the agricultural sector of the EU sanctions against Moscow are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the Commission is currently proposed 5.45 only 125 million euros in compensation.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Belarusian president may offer to Brussels to work together to minimise the consequences for еврофермеров.</seg>
<seg id="43">This could raise the authority of Lukashenko in the EU on the verdict.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hospitality without initiatives</seg>
<seg id="45">Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative for the summit.</seg>
<seg id="46">But the paradox is that the Minsk from his active role in the birth of the CU + EU открещивается format, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with Ukrainian counterpart emphasized that the new format and it was.</seg>
<seg id="47">"It was your suggestion to come without навала discuss, not with бухты-барахты decide, after signing the Association Agreement with the EU, to sort out the situation, which at the time was in Ukraine," he remonstrated before the cameras to Peter Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, observers interpreted it as an attempt to calm Moscow, rumor had it that she was originally against the intermediation of Minsk, which greatly increases his political weight.</seg>
<seg id="49">In the Belarusian diplomatic establishment try to emphasize that the interaction between the EU and Belarus on its soil does not pursue a lucrative target, but the ultimate goal of this format in the future is the creation of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.</seg>
<seg id="50">"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts which, in other areas, in particular in the field of security, puts and promotes leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation," the Foreign Ministry said "Огоньку" in Belarus, which has, in recent times, words were chosen very carefully.</seg>

<seg id="1">Anger has turned out to be the most versatile and functional human emotion</seg>
<seg id="2">Сердитое expression is biologically universal for all mankind, and everyone involved in its creation of the body and the muscle is not fortuitous, but an additional means of expressing power and threat, researchers have found in Australia and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">They told him about their discovery in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly, you can read about them in a press release at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</seg>
<seg id="4">Гневное expression - joined by climbing in and down eyebrows, lips, the thin line of 'bloated nostrils - equally in all cultures, and make it even blind from birth, children who don't have it, "said study lead author Aaron Селл.</seg>
<seg id="5">As part of a major research project on the nature of the anger, the scientists found that arose this emotion for the effective conduct of disputes during the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="6">The more physical damage one man can do to another, the greater the opportunity to dictate to him, while he pleads to partner with anger.</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers have confirmed their hypothesis: Physically and other powerful people often get angry or get to pitch invasions, consider themselves entitled to impose other disadvantageous conditions for them, and they prefer the methods of solving conflicts peacefully.</seg>
<seg id="8">Extrapolating from that anger is a bargaining emotion, "first and foremost," the scientists decided that the movement of each of the seven groups of muscles, creating сердитое expression must be гневающегося individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the other person -- and thereby force as soon as possible to agree to its terms in order to avoid conflict.</seg>
<seg id="9">To test this hypothesis, the researchers modelled on a computer, where наличествовал or absent each of seven elements гневного faces, and showed their reality.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although by climbing in eyebrow or chin proclaimed by forward individually do face evil, then изображенного with such human traits stronger physically, participants in the study acknowledged unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="11">Anger as human, and with animals, expresses a threat: Exaggerated manifestation of his own forces, the reaffirmation and agree to obey.</seg>
<seg id="12">Man поджимает inflated nostrils and lips with the same goal, and that frog, which надувается or бабуин, which demonstrates their fangs.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Anger" runs "refusal to accept the situation, and the other person's face immediately takes the form effectively has demonstrated the opposite side of the consequences of this failure.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the most striking is that none of the components гневного faces is not arbitrary, they are one and the same, "said anthropologist John Туби.</seg>
