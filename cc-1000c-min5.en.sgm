<seg id="1">Recalling a very American ideal that labor rights are human rights</seg>
<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have offered the bill, which is protected by the unions as a civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Where unions, jobs and the middle class," says Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, who is co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive factions.</seg>
<seg id="4">That is why I am proud to represent the expanding the rights of workers, along with the symbol of the movement for civil rights of John Lewis.</seg>
<seg id="5">This innovative bill will give workers the same opportunities and legal organizations, trade unions, that discrimination and other forms of discrimination, opponents of the power of the trade unions</seg>
<seg id="6">Modification of the regulation of labour relations in such a way as to allow the workers encountering discrimination for participating in organizations, trade unions, to seek justice in the civil courts, and compensation and punitive damages payments - a sensible and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it's certainly not radical initiative - at least by American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the best way to understand that offer Ellison, Lewis and the co-authors of the bill, "recall is a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the attacks, which the unions have in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country, Americans once supported countries all over the world to adopt, to expand and to respect human rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time, remember, when millions of Americans in the country at the same time, defend democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas MacArthur and his assistants have helped the country to adopt a constitution, to ensure that an autocracy Хидеки Тодзё was replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included text that explicitly admitted that "the right of workers to organize and negotiate, and collective action is guaranteed."</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Эйзенхауер and his assistants have helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that the fascism of Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recognizing that workers will need to be organized and to be heard in the new state, the Germans have included an article that openly stated: "The right to establish associations in order to protect and improve employment and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict or seek to diminish that right, will have no legal force; measures to this end, may be declared illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">When former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which was World Declaration on Human Rights, which in 1948, will be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the guarantee included the fact that "everyone has the right to organize and join unions to protect their interests."</seg>
<seg id="17">Generations took for granted the basic position that labor rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country advised on the other countries about how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans have explained that the right to organize labor unions - and the fact that this union has participated as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies, must be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now, when these rights are under attack in America, wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize, and to ensure that their voices can be heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:</seg>
<seg id="21">History is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has undermined the strength of the nation, but increased them.</seg>
<seg id="23">Raising the living standards of millions, unions miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to fragile level of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack the unions, forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.</seg>
<seg id="25">History remembers as a must.</seg>
<seg id="26">The official recognition of labour rights as human rights and the protection of civil rights, to prevent discrimination against organizations, trade unions, was long overdue.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the U.S., a federal judge on Sunday temporarily block any law in Louisiana, which his supporters say he likely will close all five абортных clinics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to this measure, which was signed by the Governor of Louisiana Bobby Джинадлом in June and was due to come into force on 1 September, doctors who do abortions, were obliged to have powers of patients in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nevertheless, the judge's decision means that, at the moment, doctors can continue to make legal abortion, while continuing to look for such powers.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally, continuing actions to gain power," he wrote in his decision, Judge John деГрэвеллз.</seg>
<seg id="6">The hearing will be scheduled within the next month, in which a judge or a more permanent solution on this law.</seg>
<seg id="7">Advocates for abortion rights are met the decision, the latest in a chain of decisions against similar measures, saying this will give doctors more time to obtain such powers.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today's decision ensures that the women will be protected from the United Louisiana law, which seeks to deprive them of the health and human rights," said Nancy Нортап, president and head of the Center for reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the five clinics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the decision applies to two clinics, doctors who were claimants in the case, and also filed a statement to authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, and the courts have recognized such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="11">Key parts of the law that would have closed техасского most of the remaining clinics in this state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">The right to abortion, along with American колледжем of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association say that the laws of the receiving impose restrictions on doctors, are not necessary from the medical point of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, though some also noted their positive effects in the closure of clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only one doctor who does abortions in Louisiana, is in the hospital, according to the Center for reproductive Rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all the other doctors in the state will be forced to stop performing the procedure, the doctor, fearing for their safety, could no longer perform the procedure, told the group.</seg>
<seg id="16">Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they would punish doctors doing abortions as long as their statements on the power of waiting for solutions.</seg>

<seg id="1">What will the introduction of quotas for domestic products</seg>
<seg id="2">Not less than half of the products for each type of product to be in the range of retail chains, said the State Duma deputy from Just Russia, Oleg Nilov has informed.</seg>
<seg id="3">The MP has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures for domestic manufacturers, writes the newspaper Izvestia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The document will still have some points will be amended or specified, in order to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.</seg>
<seg id="5">This applies to goods that are produced in Russia. <... > According to the rest of the groups of products, which are manufactured in Russia, will have to provide is: Less than half of its production to domestic producers, "Nilov has informed.</seg>
<seg id="6">Together with the amendments to the article "On the" the bill provides for the introduction of changes to the Tax Code, laying down a 10% rate of VAT in Norway with the implementation of the products produced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea to introduce a 50% quota -процентную trademark is included in the stimulus package for Russian producers.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the shelves there will be several times more than domestic goods.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the initiative could have both a positive and a negative effect, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to attorney Налоговик ", a member of the independent centre of expertise" Public Duma Sergei Litvinenko for the Russian economy, as well as for domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive in nature, and will lead to growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the pluses will be key, farmers, small shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">They will be able to sell more, and that means that profits will grow.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms and prices, retailers because they will be forced to buy their goods.</seg>
<seg id="14">Russian manufacturers will be able to increase the volume of its activities and sales that would pay higher taxes than before.</seg>
<seg id="15">It will increase revenue, create new jobs, industries will grow any faster осваиваться, will be introduced to contribute to the growth of GDP.</seg>
<seg id="16">Russia's dependence on foreign food down several times, but not immediately, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="17">Earlier, Russian companies are often unable to fight their way to the shelves of local shops due to high competition from overseas.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche freed itself and you can breathe a sigh of relief.</seg>
<seg id="19">But do not forget that, after all the necessary approvals and sanitary inspections of food products to the Russian market will come from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="20">In other words, it is now a "moment of calm, when the players have already left, and the new has not yet come.</seg>
<seg id="21">After almost a month of modern demand for Russian raw materials, as well as rising prices for finished products, "said the first all-Russian АиФ.ru Vice President," the Russian club financial directors, Tamara.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clearly, the idea of selling in each category at least 50% of the Russian food products will be the sector for local producers.</seg>
<seg id="23">In that case, they will have to compete with one another, not with products that subsidies at the expense of another state, are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="24">In other words, the fight for customers will unfold between the companies, working on a single law.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, says Kasyanov, Russian producers are able to meet 50% of the domestic needs of compatriots but not on all items.</seg>
<seg id="26">And in this situation commercial networks would have to "share" дотягивать Russian goods up to half of the range.</seg>
<seg id="27">In this regard, increasing fears that such substandard goods on the shelves.</seg>
<seg id="28">Perhaps under the guise of manufactured in Russia, will be delivered to foreign products with labels перебитыми, "adds an expert.</seg>
<seg id="29">The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will feel the large retail chains, especially those which выгодней cooperate with importers.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is logical that, when such a scenario will suffer and foreign suppliers, because the demand for their products.</seg>
<seg id="31">Litvinenko, a law on quotas on domestic goods may impact on consumers.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fact of the matter is that some of the Russian-made products can yield in the quality of imported ones, while shops will be boosting prices on the second, as the дефицитный product.</seg>
<seg id="33">About transparency in the early 2000s, but the idea of artists started talking again in February this year because of the ongoing devaluation of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="34">Now, against the background of the difficult relations with the West, the question of the import of products becomes even more urgent.</seg>
<seg id="35">The law aims to compel retailers to suppliers in the formation of orders from domestic producers.</seg>
<seg id="36">Then we go much faster and more confident by way of import substitution and the planning system will be necessary for the production of products in a shorter period of time, "says the MP Oleg Nilov has informed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Especially effective mechanism be quotas for the agricultural sector, where the potential is especially high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.</seg>
<seg id="38">Our farmers are able to fully cover the shelves in Russian shops.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition, a powerful impulse to stage production.</seg>
<seg id="40">As you know, the biggest share of imports remains on offer - from 30% to 35%.</seg>

<seg id="1">Inflation came from.</seg>
<seg id="2">If the Russians feel the sharp rise in prices</seg>
<seg id="3">As a result of the November sanctions and inflation in Russia and the West will not уложится in forecasts, analysts believe, "VTB Capital."</seg>
<seg id="4">According to experts, the delayed effects of lead to антисанкций has lending in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the latest forecast, the Ministry of Economic Development in 2014, inflation will be 6,5-7,5% the following year - less than the 6.5 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to the newspaper, "Kommersant," the commentary this week should make a "small but significant" changes in macroeconomic forecast up to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the publication, the agency ’ s assessment of inflation in 2015, which will eliminate the expected progeSOFT revenue growth of the population.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the forecast, it was assumed that the Russian food sanctions apply a year - until August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">In such a situation, you could assume such high inflation?</seg>
<seg id="10">The current situation is a shock, but during понижательный trend of inflation does not change, "said a source in the working paper.</seg>
<seg id="11">Economists from VTB Capital "is not shared by the bloc's financial and economic expectations about inflation and the government ’ s forecast price growth in 2014 at the level of 8%.</seg>
<seg id="12">The main effect of product bans will come together with the introduction of the sales tax in the regions of the Russian Federation (GAP) in 2015, experts believe.</seg>
<seg id="13">Inflation would peak at 9 per cent in February, after which the annual pace of price growth will decline, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="14">By the way, last week have pursued the inflationary outcomes after Russia introduced a "neat sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="15">АиФ.ru interviewed experts and found their inflationary expectations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Artem Деев, head of research at FC AForex:</seg>
<seg id="17">Price increases have been observed on the major segments of the goods.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moreover, when I began to appreciate the socially relevant products, the government has been forced to launch measures to monitor systemic risks to price stability, in order to prevent unreasonable price increases in the short term.</seg>
<seg id="19">Suppliers and retailers already report on a daily basis before regulators that authorities knew exactly who, where and for what reason will trigger an increase in prices.</seg>
<seg id="20">Key drivers of growth in the consumer price index continues to be tremendous pace of capital flight, excessive refinancing the banking sector from the Russian мегарегулятора, internal flight to convert into foreign currency, as well as an embargo on the imports of food products from the countries that acceded to the sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="21">If inflationary pressures remained under control, the cost of a minimum basket of food has not jumped to 12 per cent in just one quarter.</seg>
<seg id="22">A ban on the import of food a supply shock in the domestic market and led to a higher cost of логичному.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because at this stage we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, and increase self-sufficiency of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production, sanctions will continue to be part of the growth of the inflationary risks.</seg>
<seg id="24">If you include a fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as ухудшенными prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year, inflation could exceed 8%.</seg>
<seg id="25">Alexander Разуваев, director of the analytical department "par"</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 30% per month to zero, it was also higher than current levels, on the other hand, then it is offset by rapid economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="27">I think at the end of the year inflation will be 8-8,5%.</seg>
<seg id="28">Plato Магута, managing assets of the Criminal Code, "the" Магута</seg>
<seg id="29">An external factor associated with sanctions against Russia, while successfully contained, but if there is a further increase of the pressure, first of all, in the financial sector - this can lead to a certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations, which have traditionally displayed in purchases of currency to protect their savings.</seg>
<seg id="30">It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance will try to soften the weakening rouble, as current market practices and government regulation.</seg>
<seg id="31">But prices traditionally begins after a lull over the summer and, possibly, this fall will become more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="32">The target level of consumer inflation in Russia, 7.5% is likely to be, as the Russian Federation has another financial savings.</seg>

<seg id="18">Deputy director of the engineering industry ’ s capital construction Vladimir Малахов drew attention to the fact that today, the market can be divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and the company that owns монопольными competence and does not allow for this field of competitors.</seg>
<seg id="19">He believes that the creation of a transparent market is only possible when access to contracts will pass as much as possible from someone's manager.</seg>
<seg id="20">The expert council was asked to create a system of procurement in such a way that one and the same performer may not receive more than one contract for more than $1 billion or more contracts for more than $1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="21">In минстрое believe that this approach must be evaluated from the point of view of the impact on business, as well as the efficiency of the management of the building.</seg>
<seg id="22">As explained by Elena Zhukova, in this case, you will need to endow our functions, which will lead to an increase in the budget and spending on its content.</seg>
<seg id="23">The customer will need to have the knowledge to assess the quality of work performed by contractors, as well as their security.</seg>
<seg id="24">Often with such a breakdown, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the security of an object as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of highly skilled people in connection with the state in obtaining state indeed to part-time work and a small amount of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="26">The deputy head of the Institute of Purchasing экспертно-консультационного Alexander Евсташенков believes that the procurement procedure is now in business to Scor.</seg>
<seg id="27">And this example: "A participant when filling in the application must indicate the" specific performance "without any words" or equivalent "," should "," "," "more," "less than", "", "", "", "," not the same type of "lower," "lower," "higher," "may," "could have," "may," "earlier" and "not previously," "higher," "not allowed" and so on.</seg>
<seg id="28">Thus, customers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of applications, подаваемой contractors.</seg>
<seg id="29">Another problem, according to 44-ФЗ Евсташенкова, was the need to assess the quality of work through the "paper" proposal.</seg>
<seg id="30">Looking at a proposal that actually can be assessed only a qualified contractor, but not the quality of the work, which hadn't even started, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="31">The quality of the works can be assessed only on their acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="32">The experts also were asked to board a margin income from the top to the lower echelon to intermediate contractors.</seg>
<seg id="33">Chairman of the Expert Council, State Secretary, the deputy head Andrei Цариковский believes that it is not worth it, as responsible for the order should генподрядчик.</seg>
<seg id="34">And so, as in the famous репризе Arkady Raikin "Atelier": "Пуговицам claims to have?"</seg>

<seg id="7">The old yard, always open the door, propped staircase.</seg>
<seg id="8">The apartments are located near each other, the chair covers were cracked, and the walls of peeling plaster просветы seen in the street.</seg>
<seg id="9">It seems all the honest word.</seg>
<seg id="10">But local residents are told: "You don't think it is."</seg>
<seg id="11">To live in a wooden house dating from the 18th century, it is very difficult, "says Tatiana (1961, a resident of apartment # 3.</seg>
<seg id="12">The object is on the money for him, but госохране content is not tens of years, and we feel museum artifacts, which the authorities simply have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">The last renovation was 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The walls still hold great difficulties, but the foundation of the entire прогнил.</seg>
<seg id="15">Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, and higher once a week in a public bath.</seg>
<seg id="16">How can we be satisfied in such conditions?</seg>
<seg id="17">The road passes directly under the windows, even a pedestrian zone.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tatiana put up.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now you can see what before was only heard: It is under the windows of the vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="20">You see, glass, windows open дребезжат cannot, and are used to noise.</seg>
<seg id="21">One gets used to the good and the bad.</seg>
<seg id="22">Our apartment is still a top, thanks to her husband, hands in his gold.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, we have two rooms, three of them live with her son.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for other families, the conditions are much worse on the second floor of the hotel in a little more than one and a half metres tall.</seg>
<seg id="25">In contrast, offers to go to visit the roommate out of the apartment No. 6 Lyudmila Старостиной.</seg>
<seg id="26">Us woman with a cup of coffee and with a sad smile said:</seg>
<seg id="27">We have a one-bedroom apartment, 14.5 m ² for four people, and we live with her husband and daughter with his granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="28">I've been here from the birth of another boundary, has never been seen before, "Lyudmila outwits her eyes: Buying a sofa, two of the letter" g "; one of them was the granddaughter with a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="29">Very closely and differs little from a domestic interior, ceilings, beautiful "historical."</seg>
<seg id="30">But the ceiling is regularly: Tap system.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lyudmila said about his apartment and at the same time, the phone, the house which stands on the Roman ruins.</seg>
<seg id="32">There's one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:</seg>
<seg id="33">Water supply spent about 40 years ago during the last repair.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the same time we had a tiny kitchen and bathroom in закутке from former чулана.</seg>
<seg id="35">We live in a time where квартировал Demidov family lived on the second floor of the servants.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our flat does not privatized, and why?</seg>
<seg id="37">In the real estate, so it does not matter.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still have only a one-bedroom apartment can't apply for more.</seg>
<seg id="39">Already four months ago, promised to us, but promises it won't matter.</seg>
<seg id="40">Not used to complain and I will not.</seg>
<seg id="41">In this apartment (room!) lived for an entire dynasty: My grandparents, my mom and dad, I'm with my husband and my daughter with his granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="42">Things happened during that time.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, are vigorous rats ran in the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="44">Look at the walls of the outhouses, they meters in thickness.</seg>
<seg id="45">They say the solution was involved on the eggs, so for a long time, is held.</seg>
<seg id="46">The house is built, thanks Демидовым!</seg>
<seg id="47">Perhaps, therefore, as long as no one was killed with a crumbling battlement ceiling or сваей.</seg>
<seg id="48">Only construction still slowly dying there in his eyes: The board and a log house гниют, floors have repeatedly failed, pouring cement, but it is a solution, it goes into the ground, as well.</seg>
<seg id="49">They say, and is under our room the concealed лаз and move to White, who had once lived here, Old Believers who settled in order to hide from danger, in which case.</seg>
<seg id="50">They persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lyudmila Старостина tells how it came to be a historian, pleaded to let in the apartment he began excavations.</seg>
<seg id="52">And then urged to give them housing space in exchange for its однушку in October.</seg>
<seg id="53">Lyudmila historian refused:</seg>
<seg id="54">Where are we in the daily однушку?</seg>
<seg id="55">And here at least a tiny hope is that will give housing.</seg>
<seg id="56">We agree on the exchange, would not have won.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, the family Старостиных won nothing.</seg>
<seg id="58">The biggest dream, Ludmila Suburban Region, and daughter with one 16-year-old granddaughter gave a separate room.</seg>
<seg id="59">That is the family's two-room apartment instead of the two were not the majestic ruins, in which two generations living now.</seg>
<seg id="60">The girl was pretty, Olesya Карсакова sustainability of No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.</seg>
<seg id="61">In two close a total of 23 m ², apartments, her large family.</seg>
<seg id="62">All seven of us, two children.</seg>
<seg id="63">See for yourself what kind of conditions.</seg>
<seg id="64">Отваливается lumps of plaster and window frames, the walls in the kitchen, and the cross-cutting hole.</seg>
<seg id="65">The water in the кране only cold all year round.</seg>
<seg id="66">Walking about the house, the old apartments, you can see that most of the men lucky Лаврентьевым No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="67">They are the most spacious rooms of the first floor.</seg>
<seg id="68">You are right, a lot of places.</seg>
<seg id="69">The 75 square, three people give.</seg>
<seg id="70">We live in those rooms, where legend has it stopped the police during his stay in Ufa, the head of the family, "said Aleksandr Dmitrievich Lavrentyev.</seg>
<seg id="71">High ceilings, spacious.</seg>
<seg id="72">One bad - all around the train wreck that is collapsing, falling apart.</seg>
<seg id="73">Neighbors probably already told.</seg>
<seg id="74">The more suffering we have with floors, wooden boards сгнили, literally go from under the feet of the ground.</seg>
<seg id="75">I подпорки, wedges, anything in the room and go to another room, on a seesaw качаемся, so all you can.</seg>
<seg id="76">The home of the merchant Евдокима Демидова Aleksandr Dmitrievich can tell you better than any guide.</seg>

<seg id="83">The same story was repeated again in 2014: Поманили new housing.</seg>
<seg id="84">We, as a team, gathered all the necessary documents, обегали, and suddenly learned that moving into apartments in 2015 or 2016.</seg>
<seg id="85">Something already doesn't believe in all this....</seg>
<seg id="86">Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan, to learn the fate of their homes.</seg>
<seg id="87">Officials of the occupier was not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="88">Sent from one desk to another, but then, as mockery, given a piece of paper with signatures and stamps, "the Ministry of Culture is not objecting to the resettlement of the residents."</seg>
<seg id="89">I have this feeling that our house has been there for a long time in terms of the city since he was at number 57, then became 57 A, now 57 / 1.</seg>

<seg id="92">A house on the street of the October Revolution 57 / 1 is included in the resettlement programme for the old.</seg>
<seg id="93">I can't be responsible for the actions of officials in the 1970s, only know that at the time there was a plan for all the old homes, despite the historical significance.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the authorities is to rebuild the old house on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value, "successfully.</seg>
<seg id="95">Residents in the near future to plan for new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="96">According to Барабаша, restore House Демидова will be Italian experts who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="97">Now that is the Venice Biennale in Italy, and the project "Old Ufa" presented there, among others.</seg>
<seg id="98">I hope that by 2016, the whole place will captivate the former Old Street, "said the official.</seg>
<seg id="99">Purchase order, the home, which was earlier, three centuries ago.</seg>
<seg id="100">House Демидова, is likely to become a museum, open to all comers.</seg>

<seg id="102">During the day, unfortunately, don't get too much workload of roads in the city.</seg>
<seg id="103">People from the future to the Vladimir Барабаш promises in 2015.</seg>

<seg id="8">After the death of his mother was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often mused about the relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was very inaccessible.</seg>
<seg id="10">You've never seen his face, you only hear his voice: "Don't make noise.</seg>

<seg id="15">I never spoke to him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was so неулыбчивым guy in the corner, reading a newspaper which is a big part of my life.</seg>
<seg id="17">Henry recently opened a studio in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in the days of his father, he was able to look at what must have been his life.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now there's a little bit better, but it's dark, дымные have depth of Hell, with outbreaks of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father залезал in a bathtub and just lay there, and you have heard, as he slowly begins to sing, because that's what he wanted from отмыться mould.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I came back, I realized that he was doing this for years and years, to earn money for food, and I began to appreciate it more.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nevertheless, Henry came out of childhood devoid of parental love.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never hugged, never say, "I love you."</seg>
<seg id="23">It was only when her mother became ill at the end of her life, we have to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you.</seg>
<seg id="24">The birth of her own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love that he lacked as a child.</seg>

<seg id="40">And that's boring.</seg>

<seg id="49">He was at work.</seg>
<seg id="50">I not only had to grow up in front of the public, I had to learn how to be an efficient vehicle for the delivery of jokes between 1975 and 1985, as a star, working on TV, and it was very hard.</seg>

<seg id="95">They showed her a fist, if she was not cautious.</seg>
<seg id="96">First kissed, now would be a kiss was the most common erotic expression of irritation between a man and a woman; the fresh ballads, too, that the Google, first kiss her, and then hit.</seg>
<seg id="97">Excessive clarification, according to Кеверна because the kiss itself was already хулиганством.</seg>
<seg id="98">Эйлинн Соломонз case showed that he needs to leave.</seg>
<seg id="99">He rose from the secretary, as the old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She felt the weight of the lead, but the weight of his grief surprised her.</seg>
<seg id="101">This was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They barely knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">She looked, as he goes, and out of an upper window, watching it go, her companion, a man, himself at взваливший themselves.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam, a garden, she thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">She felt a stab of sympathy towards him and men in general, even though some of them and raised her hand.</seg>
<seg id="106">The man, from the pulpit, отвернувшийся behind пристыженный ’, all the capacity, to fight left him - why she felt she knew so well, if she could not recall a single case, to this day, when she saw it.</seg>
<seg id="107">Again one Эйлинн Соломонз looked at their feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">For the two years prior to the above events or so Эсме Нуссбаум, intelligent and energetic 32-летняя исследовательница who worked in "Офнау", an informal service for monitoring Community mood, has prepared a report on the low and medium levels of violence in parts of the country, where it was expected that it will be reduced, if not stop altogether, given the money and power, which have been allocated to its eradication.</seg>
<seg id="109">"A lot has been done, and a lot is being done," she wrote, "in order to mitigate the innate aggressiveness of people who fought in a war and won most of them, especially among these children and narrow спутанных расселин area, where, despite hovering over изгородями spires of churches, gentle breath of human kindness was rarely in history.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, some quality, it turns out, неискоренимы.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher, it would seem, the низменнее those passions that he зарождает.</seg>
<seg id="112">People shed tears, skipping over the sentimental stories of преодоленных obstacles and announces its overheated belief in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness retains its strong grip in the rural communities and urban settlements, but there is evidence that a new depth and a vile задиристость in homes, in the workplace, on roads and even in playgrounds.</seg>
<seg id="113">"You have a habit of writing too much." Said her supervisor, read the report as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="114">I think you should read shorter novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">Эсме Нуссбаум lowered her head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask you: You атеистка?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I think that is not obliged to answer," replied Эсме Нуссбаум.</seg>
<seg id="118">You're gay?</seg>
<seg id="119">Эсме again insisted on his right to privacy and silence.</seg>
<seg id="120">Feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Again, silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I ask," said Luther Рабиновиц, "not because I am against atheism, лесбийства or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">Here we have no prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="124">We are the servants of society without prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="125">But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely reasonable and a good in themselves, they may sometimes distort the results, such as those that you have shown me.</seg>
<seg id="126">It is obvious that you yourself предубеждены against the church, and what you call "malevolent" and "harsh", would be interpreted as an expression of natural and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="127">To continue the нудеть BUT THAT happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened, as if it had happened, if it happened yesterday, it means depriving the country of her life force.</seg>
<seg id="128">The Эсме Нуссбаум огляделась until Рабиновиц said.</seg>
<seg id="129">In his head, like the pink revolution led letters repeated advice that "Офнау" gave the country the last quarter of a century or more.</seg>
<seg id="130">His neighbour, улыбайся value of his spouse, listen to ballads, we talk on the phone, listen, communicate, pulls, соглашайся, извиняйся.</seg>
<seg id="131">The conversation is better than silence, word of the song better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I fully understand that you want to say," answered quietly Эсме Нуссбаум, when satisfied that her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I don't want to say anything, except that we do not излечились as efficiently as we convince ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">I am concerned that if we do not, we will find that repeat mistakes, which initially led to the ТОМУ THAT IF ВООБЩЕ happened, happened.</seg>
<seg id="134">Only this time, throwing their anger and distrust the other.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Рабиновиц joined the tips of fingers in the sitting.</seg>
<seg id="136">That gesture was supposed to mean an infinite patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"You go too far," he said, "calling" errors "that made or not made our grandfathers.</seg>
<seg id="138">You go too far and when talking about the fact that they have their "anger" and "mistrust" in the "other."</seg>
<seg id="139">The man should not need a reminder about the fact that, in the past, the present, we are not talking about "us" and "them."</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "us" and there was no "other."</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of turmoil - that's about all we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"For that, to be honest with ourselves," dared to insert Эсме, "no part of society is not well to justify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am not accusing anyone.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it was good or bad, what is done is done.</seg>
<seg id="145">Then it was back then.</seg>
<seg id="146">You don't have to say anything more - here we agree.</seg>
<seg id="147">And don't blame anyone, not excuses, and if this was appropriate, or if it was something you can fix.</seg>
<seg id="148">But why, if we do not to learn "</seg>
<seg id="149">Past Update to ensure that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I can add to that one word -</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther's Great Pyramid Рабиновица collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I'll review your report," he said, and dismissed it.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, on the way to work, which left her knocked мотоциклист on sidewalk, passersby, described as "a vicious rage."</seg>

<seg id="2">Growth in the eurozone slowed to the lowest in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.</seg>
<seg id="3">The business index (PMI) for the eurozone manufacturing sector of the public fell to 50.7 in August, dropping from 20-25 in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">The value of the above 50 indicates growth.</seg>
<seg id="5">New orders and businesses affected by the rising tension between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The meeting came before the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The markets for the bank from a clear plan how to deal with the eurozone ’ s recovery, as well as the threat of deflation, with inflation of just 0.3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi later this week may give further signals that he is backing for the scheme, similar to those used by the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Although some growth is better than no growth at all, braking effect of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty for manufacturers is becoming more obvious," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at public.</seg>
<seg id="10">The manufacturing sector PMI in Germany, a major trade partner of Russia in the EU, has fallen to the lowest level in 11 months of an increase.</seg>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile, the second largest economy, France, the PMI fell to an additional 46.9.</seg>

<seg id="15">One positive news from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.</seg>
<seg id="16">Howard Арчер, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that can be said about the August survey index of business activity in the eurozone manufacturing sector, is that it shows that the sector is still growing."</seg>
<seg id="17">He added: "The eurozone is finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension - particularly with the Russia / Ukraine, adds uncertainty still difficult conditions in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">This increasing tension, apparently hit by business - and especially in the confidence of consumers, and is likely to lead to the fact that some orders are delayed or avoided, especially large orders.</seg>

<seg id="23">The goal now is to become дантистом, to help people like her have helped doctors.</seg>
<seg id="24">"This tragedy has changed my life, but it's not, of course, поломала her," she says with a challenge.</seg>
<seg id="25">"It's happened to me, and you cannot change this fact.</seg>
<seg id="26">Once a year I go to the gym, to remember all those who stayed there.</seg>
<seg id="27">My friends and I tried not to talk about it on other days.</seg>
<seg id="28">The pain is too strong.</seg>
<seg id="29">My best friend, who was to be my year, Дзера Гапоева was murdered there.</seg>
<seg id="30">We played together when they were young, and dreamed that go to school together.</seg>

<seg id="38">When he was seven, and he said: "My mother told me to lie down, if there is an explosion, and hold her hand."</seg>
<seg id="39">After one of the explosions, he thought that she was dying.</seg>
<seg id="40">She told him: "Беги."</seg>
<seg id="41">Fearing that she is dead, he ran down the road and saw a crying baby, grabbed the child by the hand and ran through a hail of bullets.</seg>
<seg id="42">His father, Vladimir, who grabbed his son outside, "said Damir told me that his mother had died.</seg>
<seg id="43">He said: "I couldn't save her."</seg>

<seg id="45">After their reunion, she said: "I cried with joy.</seg>

<seg id="52">But I can now play computer games with shooting, and it's not a problem for me.</seg>
<seg id="53">"I am not afraid to return to the gym, but I don't think about yourself.</seg>
<seg id="54">I remember the children with whom I played in the yard, which has not escaped.</seg>
<seg id="55">We would never say that they killed or dead.</seg>
<seg id="56">We say that they stayed in the gym.</seg>
<seg id="57">I remember my trip to London so well, especially in a toy shop, where I was allowed to choose what I wanted, and travel in a car with an open.</seg>
<seg id="58">But now he is afraid for such places as Ukraine, where war leads to a grief that had he and his friends.</seg>
<seg id="59">This horror comes back to you every day, but I would like to think that I was able to stop him</seg>
<seg id="60">"I am sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors," said Damir, who in the past week, was doing volunteer work in a women's monastery.</seg>
<seg id="61">I want to help.</seg>
<seg id="62">I want to serve in the police ever and hope that my зачислят in training academy in the following year.</seg>
<seg id="63">His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children, have been killed in this quarter, you can imagine.</seg>
<seg id="64">I remember the silence there immediately after the takeover, it was not just the children who would have screamed and ran around, and the silence lasted for many months.</seg>
<seg id="65">She vividly remembers his trip with Дамиром in London.</seg>
<seg id="66">People in London cried when I told our story.</seg>
<seg id="67">I realized then, as people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, can support.</seg>
<seg id="68">She was grateful to "and its global fund for the award and the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="69">I would like to call the Sheri and simply to say that 10 years have passed, but I still remember a meeting with her and her husband in London and how they helped Дамиру and me.</seg>
<seg id="70">I remember when Damir wanted to eat, they rang up all the local Russian restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="71">I remember how he played with Scherer, Damir shot them from his water pistol, and they flee and played with him.</seg>
<seg id="72">And only one month has passed since our nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="73">I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our grief and to support us.</seg>
<seg id="74">She said: "I think that the world is no better over these 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="75">Right now in Ukraine there is a war, people are dying every day, and I think many children have been killed and killed.</seg>
<seg id="76">It's just the same as our children.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think for many people, war is a news broadcast, that they listen to when they get bored or when they are busy with something else.</seg>
<seg id="78">I just know that these people feel, the horror of it.</seg>
<seg id="79">And I can't stop feeling it.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.</seg>
<seg id="81">Damir grew up and became very soft and quiet boy, he's not an aggressive and angry.</seg>
<seg id="82">He is not looking for revenge, for example, he did not just fixed on it in this last nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not like to remember it, but they are very close with six classmates, and they go to a gym from time to time and burn candles there.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was younger, he suffered from this, I remember when he was lying on the couch, facing away from us, for hours.</seg>
<seg id="85">I was not asleep, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys. Дамиру now 17, he is above me, nice, smart and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">To me it is hard to believe that a few hours I was so sure that he is dead and that I never see more.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I was able to recover from the explosion and rose to his feet, I огляделась, I saw hell around when parts of bodies were lying everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely convinced that it is not possible to my little boy could survive in this hell.</seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember what I shouted to him:" Run, Damir, убегай ", but again I was so sure he had heard me.</seg>
<seg id="91">But he heard, and ran off.</seg>
<seg id="92">So life goes on for us, unlike so many others.</seg>
<seg id="93">The first of 17 years</seg>
<seg id="94">The boy, whose shocking photo after capture was decisive for the Beslan tragedy</seg>
<seg id="95">Rest: Having witnessed Beslan, the first with his mum Фатимой after taking over in 2004, and George today</seg>
<seg id="96">On his face was a bloody imprint of fear when they were fleeing from death, when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.</seg>
<seg id="97">His photo was one of the most shocking character barbarism in Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="98">His mother Fatima, 54, the chief doctor, enrolled him in the school on the first day of the study before we take the eldest son of Vladimir in the university.</seg>
<seg id="99">"I went away for two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so that my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmare," she recalled.</seg>
<seg id="100">Not just one, there was the family of our relatives, but they were all killed.</seg>
<seg id="101">I only managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="102">The closer the date, the harder it may be to think and talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="103">There is not a single day when we won't remember this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="104">We do not think that it was a long time ago, I think it was yesterday, some scenes of these days all the time, right before my eyes.</seg>
<seg id="105">Nobody will ever forget, I promise you.</seg>
<seg id="106">In западает soul: George (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was in увековечена sculpture (right)</seg>
<seg id="107">I remember George wanted to go to school that day, said that he wants to hug a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="108">I only found out that he was alive when I saw him on TV.</seg>
<seg id="109">And now even have the sculpture crying in San Marino.</seg>
<seg id="110">George doesn't like to look at this picture, and she was hidden in the closet at home.</seg>
<seg id="111">I understand, but I also think that the photos of people from all over the world are feeling the pain.</seg>
<seg id="112">George says now: "It is important that this never happened.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I doubt that we ever learn the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">People continue to investigate this tragedy and will never know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">Now they are investigating the collapse at Boeing in the Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Whether we will ever know what it was called?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world is going to be something very bad.</seg>
<seg id="118">"I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, because it is happening?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing for this pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need to have a little bit of the tens of thousands of years to forget it.</seg>
<seg id="121">It has affected my health, and I still feel it.</seg>
<seg id="122">About three or four years of nightmares because of me, but now it became better.</seg>
<seg id="123">I returned to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.</seg>
<seg id="124">I thought about their friends, and that the were killed.</seg>
<seg id="125">That is why I continue to walk into the gym before every September 1.</seg>
<seg id="126">I would like to pay tribute to the memory of my old friends from childhood.</seg>
<seg id="127">I find it hard to enter the gym, but I must do this.</seg>
<seg id="128">I don't feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.</seg>
<seg id="129">I won't forget about it, but I am not feeling sorry for ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="130">My life goes on.</seg>
<seg id="131">I graduated from high school this year and enrolled in the Medical University in Vladikavkaz.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'll learn to become кардиохирургом.</seg>
<seg id="133">My first choice was to go into the army.</seg>

<seg id="137">The boy, who survived, despite the fact that he was at the feet of террориста-убийцы</seg>
<seg id="138">Incredible: George Фарниев was at the feet of террориста-убийцы during capture, but it managed to survive</seg>
<seg id="139">At the time of the South-East Asia, he was sitting in the gym with a bomb at the feet of террориста-убийцы.</seg>
<seg id="140">Indeed, it is a miracle that he was not killed.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It seems to us that it was yesterday," says George, who wanted to learn from the intelligence officer in the FSB, but couldn't because of the damage that was caused by his health at the time of capture.</seg>
<seg id="142">It's still with me, this is not something that I left behind.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am older now, and they say that children can easily cope with bad events, I must say that this is not true.</seg>
<seg id="144">"In 2006 I worked with psychologists, and I felt a bit better after that, but I can't forget it.</seg>
<seg id="145">And I would like to forget.</seg>
<seg id="146">In 2005, the next year - was the first and last time, when I went to the gym again.</seg>
<seg id="147">I lost consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="148">I would never go there again, and, please, don't ask me to show where I was sitting in that famous photo.</seg>
<seg id="149">Alive: George Фарниев today with a photograph of himself on a laptop in the hospital after seizure</seg>
<seg id="150">My pain is enormous, and I wear it with you every day.</seg>
<seg id="151">My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about my school.</seg>
<seg id="152">With regard to the physical condition, I am healthy.</seg>
<seg id="153">I need to be cautious with the knee, which was damaged, but now I'm fine.</seg>
<seg id="154">But health is not allowed me to go to study at the Academy of the Federal Security Service in St Petersburg, as I wanted to.</seg>
<seg id="155">I sent my documents, including the medical opinions, and they said that was impossible.</seg>
<seg id="156">My second passion was animals, so I went to the institute.</seg>
<seg id="157">I had studied there for two years.</seg>
<seg id="158">He learns to treat all animals from cats to cows. "</seg>
<seg id="159">He said: "I know that never will talk to their children about their experience.</seg>
<seg id="160">It is not what children should know, and, of course, is not what they need to survive.</seg>
<seg id="161">His mother, Marina, 42, said: "The pain never leaves me.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is in my heart, and even worse, when the anniversary is approaching.</seg>
<seg id="163">I will go and will be present at the ceremonies, which will be held, to celebrate her.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know that George did not go.</seg>
<seg id="165">For him it should be even stronger, because he was there, and I don't.</seg>
<seg id="166">I was waiting for him at home and could not help.</seg>
<seg id="167">I am so grateful to God that he came back to me.... Here, in Beslan imprint lies on each.</seg>
<seg id="168">He is still with us.</seg>
<seg id="169">George, now an adult, but the nightmare was still with him.</seg>
<seg id="170">It's hard to take when something so terribly unfair, is happening to you.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was a boy, he loves sports, but they can't do because of the knee.</seg>
<seg id="172">He had several operations, he can walk, but he can't exercise.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say that he is now at 50% of this nightmare, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.</seg>
<seg id="174">This eerie experience will remain with us.</seg>
<seg id="175">Many of my friends and neighbors had been killed during the capture, and this only reinforces my pain.</seg>
<seg id="176">I lost a lot of people who I knew well and who were dear to me.</seg>
<seg id="177">My son with me, and this is the best gift that God could I do, but my heart aches for the people who were killed.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know the family, where the children were born, but I know and widows who never married.</seg>
<seg id="179">It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.</seg>
<seg id="180">I will never forget how I have the heart of выпрыгнуло from his chest at the moment, when I saw him in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="181">Now I look at what is happening in the world, "the war in different regions.</seg>
<seg id="182">These people are fighting for that?</seg>
<seg id="183">Why are they killing each other?</seg>
<seg id="184">The war is very close to our country right now, and I can hardly believe it.</seg>
<seg id="185">We were a close-knit country in the past, how did it come about that we are fighting now?</seg>
<seg id="186">The people and the children suffer, and I'm sure a lot of children have already been killed in Ukraine, and many will be killed.</seg>
<seg id="187">If we could grab all the rebels - and throw as far as you can.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips, how to achieve a better quality of underwater photos and video</seg>
<seg id="2">If you want to take pictures or shoot video under the water, you have a number of options.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is a waterproof "мыльница", for example, the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or, for example, the GoPro Hero3 экшн-камера + Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I took these pictures on a family holiday with the help of a few cameras, all for the price of about $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">No matter what equipment you are using, you need to follow a few rules, in order to achieve the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Перепроверяйте equipment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the case and other branches of the tightly closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, set up their camera for the type of photos or videos that you shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">In some photos and video cameras filming or object type is regimes that review the exposure for затемненных underwater conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in the water, find out if how deep your equipment can.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are only 5 feet, some 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Take a look at our leadership and the ratings of digital cameras for both traditional and водонепроницаемых models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Remove a few frames - because many of them do not manage.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Essentially" LCD that can help you with the brain images, while экшн-камер they are usually not.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have LCD, it will be difficult to see under the water, and there will be a random process.</seg>
<seg id="16">So do a few frames.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also, if your camera has the serial, which takes a few shots a little bit different with the plant, use them.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">The amount of light is significantly reduced, the deeper you нырнете under water.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, stay at the surface, when you're shooting in the pool, the river or the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">It also allows you to transmit more colors in the photos; the deeper you get, the less you see color.</seg>
<seg id="22">Подплывайте closer to objects.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is a great tip for shooting on the land, but it is even more important under the water because of затемненных light conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is especially important if you're shooting on экшн-камеру: This equipment often comes with a fixed, широкоугольной lens, which means that you have to get closer to the object, if you want to fill the frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was such a man, whose force of personality could shake things around, even in such a giant organization like the National Health Service.</seg>
<seg id="2">After консультирующий, he dedicated his career needs of patients suffering from the disease, and from such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among those who spoke to him, recalls his wife, Pontus, who was the officer had to live with devastating effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that as long as the doctor being passionate about it, and those who are on treatment, mainly, is something quite different - the pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, however, he appeared to those who suffer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I never felt, as usual," he wrote in May last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was hard to find in themselves the strength.</seg>
<seg id="8">Struggling with symptoms similar to flu, he found that his wife, Джулиет reproaches irritably.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I wish it was sooner rather than later," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Джулиет left for a week, Lawson found that unusual and it is not clear why he was upset.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked colleague chest X-rays.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks before he went skiing in the Alps lead.</seg>
<seg id="14">The results of the X-rays came.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was mesothelioma, a terminal cancer, which affects плевру, or the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="16">For most cancers, it is difficult to determine an exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although some people fall ill with lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients who smoked.</seg>
<seg id="18">But with мезотелиомой differently.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, grainy, construction material, who once called a "miracle," but which, as we now know, mortally dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us is disease mesothelioma, which can be not to pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos, at the end of the day, is the stuff from the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in the UK since the 1960s, when its industrial ban came into force.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even when it has been used only in specific sectors worked in close contact with him: Трубоизолировщики, builders, carpenters and workers, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">Industrial toxin from another era, he is hardly a cause for concern today.</seg>
<seg id="25">But such a calm.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it turns out, is now at the peak of the epidemic мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="27">The мезотелиомы dies from more people than in any other country on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="28">The annual death rate at about 2500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease than as a result of road accidents.</seg>
<seg id="29">The annual number of deaths from мезотелиомы since 1980 and projected in the future, the number of deaths in the UK</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason we feel its deadly consequences right now, lies in the fact that, although the use of asbestos and it is illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), for the development of мезотелиомы go usually tens of years.</seg>
<seg id="31">And this is not limited to мезотелиомы veterans specialties.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was and, in many cases, the remains in the house where we live, where we work, schools, where we learn, and shops, where we go shopping.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention in class, the level of income, profession or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">Bastions of избранности, from fashion London department stores to private schools, as it turned out, not salvation.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parliament building is riddled with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even hospitals that are intended to treat us, reservoirs of this death as a carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was not трубоизолировщиком.</seg>
<seg id="39">In fact, he had to think about where he might have come into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he realized.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It seems that could be a lot of asbestos in the tunnels, where Guy at the hospital, I spent six years on an internship," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">All are students, nurses, doctors and грузчики - used these тоннелями.</seg>
<seg id="43">I wonder how many of my peers expect the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">It was a question to which, unfortunately, he was able to give a partial response.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Of the four doctors, who are in hospital and subsequently Guy developed mesothelioma for the past five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I alone remained alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us expect this disease?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Лоусону was diagnosed with mesothelioma, "" when he was 48 years old.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">To live so long.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty percent of patients die мезотелиомой through eight months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is always fatal.</seg>
<seg id="52">So, now, we can only repeat the question: "How many of us Лоусона expect this disease?"</seg>
<seg id="53">According to a leading expert in the UK, Professor мезотелиоме Джулиану Пито, most likely to suggest that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK should be an about success, will die.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most now are not what will die in this way.</seg>
<seg id="55">Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada telecentres are being set up</seg>
<seg id="56">A report from the halls of the court, where victims are often seek compensation, shows how far it has spread attack мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="57">In June, for example, Marks & Spencer, have recognized that Джэнис Ellen contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, apparel departments at two sites, one of which was the store on Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs. Allen was just 18 years old, when she started working at M & S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now her two children more than 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Before this happened," she says, "I had never heard about мезотелиоме, I barely knew about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="62">And in my head I could not come to that, it will affect me.</seg>
<seg id="63">Few people really know a lot about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="64">In fact, asbestos is not one substance, and a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">They get their name from the word "асбестиформ", which means the fibrous structure, which tells them the strength and flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="66">Of the six, three were often used in the construction.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotile, or white asbestos, widely known as the other occurs more often in buildings today.</seg>
<seg id="68">It has been used in roofing panels, outdoor stove pipes, boilers, thermal insulation, even in braking seventeen vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is less смертелен than other forms of asbestos, but still recognised by the European Union and the World Health Organization "as a reliable source of health damage, which can lead to death.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, brown asbestos (амозит) and blue asbestos (крокидолит).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that "there are good, though indirect reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with мезотелиомой [in the UK]."</seg>
<seg id="72">A worker at Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the main store on Oxford Street, London telecentres are being set up</seg>
<seg id="73">Джэнис Ellen may not have thought of myself as a victim, but Julian Пито мезотелиомы work suggests that her story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that "a significant percentage of мезотелиом when there is no known exposure at work or at home, were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment."</seg>
<seg id="75">Most of the time, he says, is a "regular" and the weather in our building.</seg>
<seg id="76">No one, it seems, can't be sure that he is safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">The report Goddard Consulting, which was considered Вестминстерский Palace, demonstrates how, even in the heart of government, may have been exposed to.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009, Goddard said that the mines and pipelines for the premises of parliamentary committees have been infected, deadly asbestos fibres which could have given in the movement, something so harmless as "strong currents of air."</seg>
<seg id="79">Members of the parliament often blame the fact that they are pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.</seg>
<seg id="80">Although for maintenance of Parliament insisted that Вестминстерский Palace received a "clean bill of health," she acknowledged, however, that it is necessary to work on the £1 billion for the reconstruction of the Parliament, by upgrading electrician and removing asbestos, and that after the general election of 2015, members of Parliament, for example, will meet in the conference centre nearby, but not in the green benches related.</seg>
<seg id="81">The report Goddard said that "the situation with the asbestos is not Poland, in accordance with the various rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">It is impossible to know whether this error management cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All we can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">One of those who have not managed to identify his contact with asbestos, Graham is the cost, the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson, cost, 50 years, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I was working at the hospital, which has successfully brought claims associated with asbestos," he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It's so hard to remember all the places, where he worked, and dates.</seg>
<seg id="88">He remembers clearly the day in early December 2009, when his сразило something that was like the flu.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">All of a sudden were shaken as me.</seg>
<seg id="91">It started very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terrible.</seg>
<seg id="93">I thought that I could go all the way to homes.</seg>
<seg id="94">As a doctor, we knew that the pain comes from, including checking for iframe loads a shell around the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="95">However, like Джэнис Ellen, he just did not have reason to suspect мезотелиому.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the end, he couldn't walk for a month.</seg>
<seg id="97">US doctors doing chest x-rays and put плевральные катетеры to pull fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis.</seg>
<seg id="98">And yet his condition оставлось without a diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">Gradually, his health has improved, and he returned to work.</seg>
<seg id="100">But from time to time the same symptoms return, often after he was doing, and he breathed heavily.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, one of the patients came to him in the Dubai office with similar symptoms, and he was later diagnosed with mesothelioma. ""</seg>
<seg id="102">But even then we are not linking this with his own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">In the end, his patient was in the tens of thousands of years old, and have worked with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">In this case, the connection was obvious.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011, the state of Dubai has worsened again, and his doctor консультировавший showed it the results of the CT and X-ray images of the group.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, just two years after we started to feel ill, the sensor, the camera was introduced into the cavity between the shell of his chest and his lung.</seg>
<seg id="107">I'm an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I usually just go further, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="109">I'm not too upset about it, to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife was.</seg>
<seg id="111">The biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that it was mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham: Cost of mesothelioma diagnosis</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly we sank in meetings with Macmillan nurses, one of which suggested he contact a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">It was then that he realised the scale of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"As it turns out, asbestos is widely used, especially in large public buildings, and where quite often there was asbestos thermal insulation systems on the pipes," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, now ill with the disease.</seg>
<seg id="117">Thus, mesothelioma is now more than young people, atypical professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous asbestos pipes isolated in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees who were on the pedestrian tunnels connecting nearby landmasses can bring together to get from one building to another (as Andrew Lawson), or eat in canteens подвальных (how often did we) Graham almost certainly really were exposed to toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">For several decades after the war, as it turns out, the hospital was a place where, in theory, our life for поциентов, but the place, which constituted a threat to life, for the doctors who treat them.</seg>
<seg id="121">It still continues to remove today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students set their own burner Бунзена speaker stands in the 3rd</seg>
<seg id="123">And it's not just hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and мэриях due to their amazing and insulating characteristics input.</seg>
<seg id="125">Schools too.</seg>
<seg id="126">In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the classroom for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="127">Across the country, countless students through their chemistry lessons, the burner Бунзена 3rd speaker stands.</seg>
<seg id="128">Appeared on websites, Ad problem of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as floor tiles or roof сараев usually contained asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"This is an industrial poison, in a huge number of our buildings," says Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Лоусона Guy in a case against the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case, the only contact, which might recall, was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So be careful, снося garden sheds.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effect of the diagnosis, when we know that the disease is incurable, is huge.</seg>
<seg id="134">"To realize it, is quite a lot of time," says Graham cost.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to continue, but realized that I couldn't focus on what I'm doing.</seg>
<seg id="136">I spent two weeks in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I realized that I had to go and deal with them.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I will not be met by Christmas</seg>
<seg id="139">One of the most difficult things was the transition from doctor to patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">Like countless people before him, he remembers, was felled by the amount of information that had to be taken.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was difficult to understand," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked his doctor" how many I have time? "</seg>
<seg id="143">Gave me about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember I thought, "Well, I never met her.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's all. "</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, as it is the mechanics of how we are in life, "the very act of breathing, raises cancer, which kills.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases are caused by мезотелиомы contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.</seg>
<seg id="149">When asbestos is being destroyed and the carcinogenic fibers, they can get stuck in the lungs, плевре shell.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibers are annoying плевру and can cause mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem is due to the inhalation of asbestos fibres needle," Professor Tom Трежер, кардиоторакальный surgeon, who came to the hospital in 2001, Guy.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is the hospital, where the suspect, Andrew Lawson, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="153">Трежер knew Лоусона and treated some of the others who, perhaps, was exposed to while in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">When Sally Goodin Sally goodun Etc asbestos in the lungs, "says Трежер breathing them to unload on the periphery, where the shell.</seg>
<seg id="155">It is, in its essence, invasive process from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="156">Conventional treatments of other forms of cancer is much less effective in мезотелиоме.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is controversial.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some think it is worth a try.</seg>
<seg id="159">Трежер disagrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">"You can't cut плевру," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">It is impossible to approach it with a knife.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, the cancer is "not very well to chemotherapy," which "acts", but not people.</seg>
<seg id="163">"From time to time there are patients who live a long time," says Трежер.</seg>
<seg id="164">But in the end, they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some patients are living much, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">Writer Stephen Jay Gould died in 20 years after he was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years after diagnosis, Graham cost continues to fight.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he became ill, first with Andrew мезотелиомой Dubai Лоусоном, which, four years after diagnosis, had turned into a desk support and advice for patients.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Yes," its Раковая Central, he said, when they called.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," says cost.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was diagnosed four years ago, and he still is very energetic.</seg>
<seg id="172">First Эбботту offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and prolonged his life only a month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was in despair," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, managed to a more positive agenda. "</seg>
<seg id="176">Meeting with several specialists, we decided to continue treatment with Professor Лоиком Ланж-Лаздунски, a professor of surgery at the hospital for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage in that I don't need it, I just called them and they took me," admits Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">Consultants, and the patient would have to get the direction and approval for funding.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money plays a decisive role for patients with мезотелиомой so as to get the best available treatments.</seg>
<seg id="180">But when such treatments become ineffective, finally, inevitably, many patients still face a financial reason for concern "about the future, they will leave.</seg>
<seg id="181">And then they ask the courts for compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan, of Field Fisher Price Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It has been known that asbestos is harmful to health, in 1898," said Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But that changed in the 1960s, is that it became clear that even very small amounts of health could be at risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">It was then spoke about the bad faith.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and hospital Guy eventually resolve the case, but it was not "the full cost of the settlement," according to Morgan, as Lawson could not clearly prove that his mesothelioma was the result of exposure to asbestos at Guy.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation into his death, a spokesman for the hospital, Guy was confirmed, however, that "asbestos in its basement, mentioned above, was removed in the 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="188">It was too late for Andrew Лоусона.</seg>
<seg id="189">How to remove asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">In fact, even deadly contact with asbestos to one company or place of work - usually through dozens of years after that, it turned out to be a big problem for patients with мезотелиомой requiring compensation.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have the owner or shut down.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance archives could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who are protected from lawsuits, know what's on their side, which the plaintiffs have, of course, no.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, this year took serious new legislative acts, which make it easier for patients with мезотелиомой process recovery of compensation, even if their former employers, it is impossible to track down.</seg>
<seg id="195">In accordance with the law, was created by £350-миллионный fund of funds, which is financed by the insurance industry, and for those who was diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove, but anyone who did not sue.</seg>
<seg id="196">In such cases, patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in a case about the compensation of about £120,000.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful claims under this scheme is expected to be every year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with мезотелиомой, believes that the £350 million represent a "very good work" for the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"This is the deal, companies for insurers," he says, hinting that the sum is a quarter of that, insurers would have to pay, if not intervened time and sick with мезотелиомой would have been able to track down the company and file a lawsuit in the usual way.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even Mike Пеннинг, formerly the minister of labour and pensions, acknowledged that the law "imperfect."</seg>
<seg id="201">But Пеннинг, and Morgan acknowledged that, while seven people die every day, rapid action was needed.</seg>
<seg id="202">"People suffer so much, and they need help now," said Пеннинг during the second reading of the Bill of мезотелиоме in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">By the time Graham cost was in the hands of Professor Лоика Ланж-Лаздунски 19 months.</seg>
<seg id="204">After the initial consultation Ланж-Лаздунски recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Трежера, he believes to be effective.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was followed by chemotherapy, and радиотерапия тритерапия Ланж-Лаздунски can boast, for 40 percent of patients surviving for five years.</seg>
<seg id="206">We felt a surge of strength.</seg>
<seg id="207">"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says cost.</seg>
<seg id="208">You see these patients all the time.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is a force that supports you.</seg>
<seg id="210">When сдаешься, the condition can deteriorate very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham went to the cost of the operation in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">By the end of August he finished the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">The scan showed no trace of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had a scan in March [2014].</seg>
<seg id="215">There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I just had to come.</seg>
<seg id="217">This is not a threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="218">This is the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="219">And once again we went through six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now there is no trace of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="221">However, this process is both physically and emotionally heavy.</seg>
<seg id="222">You can think about practical things - about finance, when I die, for example, or about the fact that we need to show his wife how to бойлере timer.</seg>
<seg id="223">When you get bad news, you become безрадостным.</seg>
<seg id="224">We need to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="225">As the father of Ellie, 16, and 14 years old, it Тэмзин is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">"It is difficult for a parent," he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.</seg>
<seg id="228">For the first time when I was diagnosed, I told the girls that I had the disease, which means that I won ’ t live to old age.</seg>
<seg id="229">They reacted very differently.</seg>
<seg id="230">Тэмзин very social and energetic.</seg>
<seg id="231">She said all of her friends, and we received many very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="232">Ellie was more restrained.</seg>
<seg id="233">She didn't say much.</seg>
<seg id="234">Such talk is something that has to have all the patients with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="235">But for patients with мезотелиомой such discussions are not caused by visions of hope, even the ability to survive.</seg>
<seg id="236">The disease is sex (even as, in the end, for Steven Jay Гулда) grim certainty.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders, protesters promise revenge</seg>
<seg id="2">China's parliament decided Sunday to not allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reforms.</seg>
<seg id="3">Such a move is likely to mark the beginning of long ago promised protests in Hong Kong as activists have begun planning and mobilization in a matter of hours after that statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the National People ’ s Congress, in fact, communist leaders to remove all of the candidates, who are loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's not обмануло our expectations, but still in a rage," said legislator Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's not that Beijing had promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">They lied to the people of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defending the decision of China, Li Fey, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the 11th National People's Congress, said that to allow public nomination for Hong Kong's leader would be too "classic."</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when the UK handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing promised to allow residents to vote by the head of the government, starting in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Sunday, Chinese leaders have taken the decision as a democratic step forward, because it gives the right to direct гонконгцам vote; however, the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold in his hands with the help of the Commission on the appointment of candidates, rigidly controlled from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, according to a new article that only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision was taken after the summer, when there have been some of the most extensive and received widespread publicity the protests in Hong Kong for many years.</seg>
<seg id="14">For a large part of the campaign to transform the movement in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, which threatened to cut off the financial district in Hong Kong if Beijing does not guarantee of universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday evening, a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="16">The organizers of the demonstration said that their movement is shifting to a new phase of civil disobedience and that they rise to waves of protest in the next few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, they have not reported the details, apparently in an effort to avoid problems with government authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In онлайн-заявлении, the organizers said the movement "to capture the обдумывало only as an exceptional measure, action that can be taken only if all the possibilities of the dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We regret to inform you that today, all possibilities have been exhausted and the seizure of the dialogue will take place.</seg>
<seg id="20">Authorities in Hong Kong were preparing to Beijing a few days, and on Sunday the government had strengthened security measures with the help of police and barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">The unrest is the feeling of many in Hong Kong, they slowly lose control over their own city.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement, saying that his demonstration to jeopardize business is the lifeblood of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protest, which they say it can lead to great economic damage, depending on how many people will participate, and for how long," said the legislator, Regina Yip, who has long been critical of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="26">We do not want to spread concern about the fact that Hong Kong is out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This view, which is harmful for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chinese state media also gave reports in recent days, in which the activists of the democratic movement in Hong Kong were направляемыми диверсантами, Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral law, which has attracted members of the 7th - more than one-fifth of voters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="30">In July tens of thousands came out to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists raise issue of race and the behaviour of the police after Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">Unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Фергюсоне, Missouri, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">Raise the hands, chanting: "Hands up, don't стреляй" while they wait in line in front of the burial.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Фергюсоне, Missouri, teenager Michael Brown killing 45, blogger Perez said Miriam зоила интернет-разговоре shift among white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">In her experience, the white feminists, men put gender above race, when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, as tensions rose in the Midwest and attracted national attention, Peres saw the white women who is 100 percent focused on the race.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared with the reaction of black women shortly after the killing on 9 August, personal essays with such titles as "thoughts about Фергюсоне on behalf of a white woman" and "Феминизм is not only about the late 1980 women" appeared relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Perez, they demonstrated a significant shift.</seg>
<seg id="9">"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who are talking about white skin, and was on such a high level," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People feel the need to say something about what has happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is a very symbolic for the crisis with which we are faced, and because of the situation in the Фергюсоне) is so tied to the race, they felt that it should be.</seg>
<seg id="12">For a professor of English at the University of Ohio Кориты Mitchell Ferguson has laid bare problems that blacks face every day, but one which is not perceived as a "women's issue" in the cultural sphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner, and get a 150 лайков from everywhere," says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">When I write something about how colored people are attacked in his own country, silence Duper.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Why do women safe in public to talk about the relationship, but not about the security in the public sector?" She asks.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women, like Mitchell, who studied questions of race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between matters relating to race and gender.</seg>
<seg id="17">From their point of view, blacks, women are in a position to clearly separate the problems; they are faced with a complex reality every day.</seg>
<seg id="18">At the time, as white women now bring together issues of race and gender in feminist мейнстриме, Энджела Хэттери, professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, said that its predecessor did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 1865 and 1890 years линчевали, at least 10,000 black men, and it is almost always served as the rape of white women," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="20">A white woman, Ufa narrative to justify Nepal.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the point of view of Хэттери, the gap between white and black women, while white суфражистки, for example, Susan B. Anthony looked at the situation in the late 1800s, and saw that the fight for suffrage will be effective only for one of the groups: Women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They have decided to lay all the eggs in the basket of the voting rights for women, and the right to vote for blacks was to appear later," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="23">To look back on this kind of thing gives us a clear idea of why colored women don't trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have not done anything good.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to white women united against mob lynchings in the South during the Women's Association to prevent mob lynchings.</seg>
<seg id="27">The group appeared nearly 40 years after the first was asked to help blacks, women, "said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">From the point of view of Mitchell, the reactions of white feminists on the issues raised in the conduct of the police, Фергюсоне, "racial discrimination" reflects a time when white a feminist had to "catch up" to blacks, women cope in several generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"However, it would be great if the politically active women, those who have such a [traditional] феминистическая ideology, would seriously to raise a child, as they relate to the right to contraception?" Asked Mitchell.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the market for electric cars</seg>
<seg id="2">This week the Ministry of Economic Development will make the government a comprehensive plan for the development of clean vehicles in Russia, told the deputy director of the Department of the Ministry of Oleg Плужников round table that held a Moscow newspaper Vedomosti on show - 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">The plan drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals is to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is expected that the document will be passed in late September and early October, said the proposed measures concerning Плужников, electric cars and hybrids is the development plan of the vehicles on the газомоторном fuel in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="5">(A copy of the plan have said) is designed for 2014-2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">To develop criteria and hybrid vehicles and power to decide how to promote the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">The government report, which will be described in the tax and customs measures 4 support, will be prepared by December 2014, the scheme of preferential loans and preferential leasing will emerge by April 2015, and proposals to reduce prices, and encourage the creation of service the infrastructure will be developed by October 2015</seg>
<seg id="8">In the 2014-2015, is expected to make changes to regulations to ease conditions for building infrastructure (зарядной sports, filling stations, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, federal officials plan for 2015 to formulate proposals for regional authorities, as well as to promote the use of clean transport - in the form of the movement and parking, for example; and by February 2016 and the expansion of the state.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, the Ministry of Economic Development by October 2014 will depend on the evaluation of the activities of the regional authorities of criteria that reflect the effectiveness of the support of transport infrastructure, the development of зарядной.</seg>
<seg id="11">The market for electric cars in Russia, only formed in 2013 across the country sold about 100 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the beginning of the 2014 обнулена import duty on electric cars, so sales will be about 500 units, Chief Executive Officer of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the Sunderland branch does not make any noticeable: In 2013, according to the Association of European Businesses, sold segment million cars and light commercial vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="14">As long as the experts in Russia imports only Mitsubishi Motors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Start import is preparing Renault - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, director of strategic planning and partnerships in Russia Renault Nicolas Ремиз.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most of the other manufacturers of electric vehicles took in relation to Russia is taking a wait-and-see approach.</seg>
<seg id="17">The development of electric cars and Russian manufacturers GAZ directors "," ",", "but the issue apparently.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in January - July 2014, according to the "АСМ-холдинга," Avtovaz released 30.</seg>
<seg id="19">Demand for electric cars, acknowledges the modest cost of AvtoVAZ in Latvia, Sergei Аманов without state support will not be a breakthrough in this segment.</seg>
<seg id="20">The development of the Russian market in electric cars (in addition to the cost of the electric cars that are sold in Russia, on average, more than twice as many unique internal combustion engine) holds an underdeveloped зарядной infrastructure ("unit"), "sighs CEO Sergei Автостата Целиков.</seg>
<seg id="21">Because of the cost and the low pace of reducing the cost of electric cars in the next 3-4 years remain нишевым segment of the Russian market, "Chief Editor Mikhail Авторевю Целиков Подорожанский, agrees with him.</seg>
<seg id="22">Car manufacturers, on the other hand, say that some models of electric cars is already close to the value of the ordinary.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Russian market has substantially good prospects, instill confidence in consumers that "real" электромобильность; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of new charging stations, president of BMW's Wolfgang Шлимме.</seg>
<seg id="24">Such infrastructure projects, for example, is in "Россети": In Moscow several stations, soon there will be about 80.</seg>
<seg id="25">"There are talks about building networks with other regions.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to the director of the department "Россетей Vladimir Софьина, the company believes the market is ready to build electric and gas stations across the country, but there are problems: A small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging different brands.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, "Россети" as network the company does not have the right to engage in the sale of electricity, to do this in relation to charge electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="28">Wife says the most effective measure of support in the single market progeSOFT customs duties.</seg>
<seg id="29">Zero rate will act before the end of 2014, its extension, expansion of preferential list.</seg>
<seg id="30">The transportation tax to environmental (the idea is being discussed, and relates to all vehicles), too, will support the market, but not as noticeably as the customs preferences, for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="31">Tax in Russia is small, said Pankov, unlike, for example, from Norway, where the reduced tax rate led to a sharp increase in electric sales - now they account for 12% of the market.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, and the need for stimulus measures, such as free parking in the centre of town (as it has done in Moscow), I am sure, or 25 years of dedicated lanes for electric cars, which in Russia.</seg>

<seg id="24">First of all, the growth in the revenue part of the budget from the export operations, as well as to increase the competitiveness of domestic manufacturers at the expense of more expensive imports, "says chief analyst UFS IC Alexei Kozlov.</seg>
<seg id="25">The negative moments can be attributed to the cost of imported goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of the investment in the Russian economy, encourage the growth of inflationary pressures and, as a consequence, the cause of more expensive borrowing money, which, in turn, slows down the development of the country ’ s economy.</seg>
<seg id="27">If we talk about the stock market, the rouble devaluation of a lack of decline in stock prices, expressed in roubles.</seg>
<seg id="28">For example, the MICEX index during trading Thursday fell 1.63 percent and the RTS Index lost 3.27 percent.</seg>
<seg id="29">Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of reduction of indices due to the weakening of the ruble exchange rate during the day more than 1.5%.</seg>
<seg id="30">The weakening of the ruble is an emotional character and can be explained by a desire to buy the currency.</seg>
<seg id="31">In practice, as emotions go, and the rouble was partially or completely restore it lost ground.</seg>
<seg id="32">"Soon, we will be able to see the value of the dollar and the Russian currency is near the level of 36 rubles to the dollar," said Alexei Kozlov.</seg>

<seg id="2">Восстанавливающаяся economy means more customers, the more sales and jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Account for taxes at the state and local level for companies across the country, have increased in the past year, when accelerated the recovery, according to a new study, published last week, and the company in the Washington area is no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion in the state and local level in fiscal 2013, to 3.8 per cent more than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tax burden on business in the state and local level in the past year rose by 4.3 per cent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent the year before, and it was the third straight year of growth after avoiding each other, smaller accounts in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">Taxes, rose 4.3 percent, faster than the local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to the research, which was conducted by providing professional services, Ernst & Young and the Center on taxation, the tax policy.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the tax revenue in the county, 56 percent in taxes on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of tax revenue for Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia, with 28 percent, is the lowest in proportion to the amount of tax revenue, and entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="10">To a large extent, the growth of tax revenues is due to return to the same level of the value of real estate companies, the researchers say, that raised property taxes by 3.7 per cent this year, after three years in a row, when growth was less than 1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large proportion of those earnings in larger states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same thing is happening in the Washington area.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion property taxes at the state and local level in the past year, to $9.6 billion more than in 2012, an increase of 4.2 per cent, compared with the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the return of the value of the property doesn't have any more effect on the growth of tax revenue for the state and local level in Maryland, where property taxes are unlikely to exceed one-fifth of companies' tax bills.</seg>
<seg id="14">Virginia and the District of Columbia are paying about half the tax bills at the state and local level, in the form of taxes on real estate.</seg>
<seg id="15">"What is happening in Maryland, is that such a big part of their tax base, especially around the District of Columbia, belongs to either the government or nonprofit organization that does not pay property taxes," said Douglas Линдхолм, executive director of the Center on taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, Maryland is forced to rely far more on income taxes to pay for those services that exist in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent increase in tax receipts from businesses cannot fully explain the recovery of the real estate market.</seg>
<seg id="18">Income entrepreneurs also, it seems to me, is on the mend, according to this data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Companies in the region, Chinese corporate income tax at a level of $2.3 billion to $2.1 billion more than in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland has collected $1 billion of corporate income tax, the most in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although the trends are aimed in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase with the same speed in all three areas.</seg>
<seg id="22">The level of growth in the District of Columbia was on the same level as the average for the country of 4.3 per cent, while growth was significantly faster in Maryland, 4.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">Virginia was the rise in tax revenues, equal to the average of 4.1 per cent.</seg>

<seg id="3">The duo Royal Blood all year on the stage, but already has the nomination for the BBC, the music prize for Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the doorframe New York concert from the right, Jimmy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Their self-titled debut is still several months before release received 100,000 предзаказов contract, and the issue lies in the portfolio мейджор-лейбла Warner Music.</seg>
<seg id="5">Given the present situation on the market, a musical плачевную situation extraordinary statements, because this is not about new Lana del Ray, or another сладкоголосом representative "of the new R 'n' B, 'and about the British duo быковатых, playing with the level of volume and intensity, that the last time was in vogue two decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">In general, rates on the first album in connection with all вышеозначенными circumstances were especially high, and is hollow.</seg>
<seg id="7">The duo did not take his name in vain, that this could prejudice is that a desperate волосатые metallers and the blood of kings is what they believe in their veins, too.</seg>

<seg id="13">It should be noted, as well as a "Little Monster" and will record the song "Better" with November шекспировской quote in the title.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the truth is that each of these songs would sound great at a party of heavy rock, but when they merge into a more or less uniform.</seg>
<seg id="15">And this is not necessarily bad, on the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="16">The strength of the Royal Blood in the fact that they do not claim suggests new Lennon and McCartney (rather a bad mark in successors Motörhead), but many of the ghetto рок-дуэты инди-клубов.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their music, despite some variety, created for stadiums, in the room, less than a couple of thousand people, it obviously is.</seg>

<seg id="20">Heroes ретророка zero with great difficulty outside their postmodern paradigm, with great reluctance come to recognise not just эпигонами and independent creative units.</seg>
<seg id="21">Royal Blood are now sound so brazenly, and that the pressure and a successful драпирует вторичность твердолобость musical material.</seg>

<seg id="21">How Amazon works on this?</seg>
<seg id="22">It is hard to imagine that the Amazon Instant Video свернется worth as gracefully as YouTube would simply absorb worth.</seg>

<seg id="1">Cunning ways to save on university textbooks</seg>
<seg id="2">Given that the cost of university textbooks for many students more than $1000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move to the second course, came up with an ingenious way to reduce costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">He developed a system of the books have to hire старшекурсников, nominal compensation that they delayed their sale.</seg>
<seg id="4">"My textbook on mathematical analysis, which usually costs $180, for $10 a semester and biscuits" Chick-fil-A "," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying in Ковенант College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The literature on the cost would be $430 last semester, he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He spent $120.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the Council, the average college student spends $1,200 a year on books and supplies, but the students have a number of options to reduce these costs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Students are increasingly choosing to do and creative ideas, such as the system ’.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rent books is becoming more and more popular, allowing students to use the book for the semester, and is often significantly cheaper than buying them.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Нибо Инкорпорейтид", which has more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of rental books has doubled since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">Industry studies show that about a quarter of books in university book stores during the past spring semester were taken, said the vice president "Нибо" Trevor Meyer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Less than half of all books sold in university book stores, according to the National Association of the university's professional union shops. "</seg>
<seg id="13">Here's introductory course on the best ways to make a deal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Buying in online store</seg>
<seg id="15">Sometimes, if you'll come out in the Internet, the price of a new book may be one third of the one that you'll see in the university bookshop.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" Ron Larson ’ s Bruce Edwards's and Robert Хостетлера costs about $290 for a new instance of the tariff, but can be purchased for $239,99 site Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Buying подержанного</seg>
<seg id="18">If you don't mind other people's notes or damage, second-hand textbooks are a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Mathematical analysis" sold for $93,49 подержанном form on to Chegg.com.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Кэсэдей, 25 years later, a fourth year student at the University of Бригэм Young, said that paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of the book "strategic decisions in the media: An understanding of the business side of the advertising business."</seg>
<seg id="21">The book sold for $48.</seg>
<seg id="22">Teachers, for example, the Ingrid Брейси, director of "without walls" College at the University of Massachusetts in Эмхерсте, offers to students with their professors, could use the previous editions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates are insignificant for the class.</seg>
<seg id="24">In such cases, the old editions can often be found in a very small fraction of the cost of the latest edition.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition to websites Amazon and Chegg, Half.com, "owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying second-hand books.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hire</seg>
<seg id="27">How to take textbooks, hire a car, you need to think, if you are well enough with them, don't forget to return them and don't want to leave them to themselves after the course is completed.</seg>
<seg id="28">You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, a student could rent a "Математический analysis" on the semester for about $20.</seg>
<seg id="30">Find out the rules to a store where you take books, including any fines that you can write for the markings, underscore and damage.</seg>
<seg id="31">If you take a book, remember: If you don't book upon you; return, fines may even exceed the cost of the new instance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Electronic books</seg>
<seg id="33">Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks is another option.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sometimes, these books are, in a way a license for a certain period for retailers, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rent "Mathematical Analysis" on the site Chegg.com for six months will cost about $61.</seg>
<seg id="36">Брейси says that students who study literature, can often find the most competitive prices, as many of the classics, you can now add the literature on natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.</seg>
<seg id="37">No matter what, you.</seg>
<seg id="38">Joe Голт, 29, who is going to start their studies in high school, and recommends that you use Пеппердин ISBN number to book prices, as this will ensure that you are looking for is required.</seg>
<seg id="39">But before you order online, "says Голт, be sure to check whether a book is in stock.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is not easy for him this lesson Gol.</seg>
<seg id="41">The book, which he bought, was postponed for four weeks, and, in the end, he paid the full price in the university bookshop.</seg>

<seg id="40">On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of specific measures to ensure the security of Russia, which is basically food sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="41">The country banned the import of pork, beef, a by-product from meat and poultry, meat, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cheese, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausage and сахарные syrups.</seg>
<seg id="42">Restaurants have started чехарда with suppliers, the price of food rose, there is an urgent need to find counterparts from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="43">All this will have an impact on the expensive restaurants with монокухней France, Italy, Spain, in which products supplied directly from the "maternal" countries.</seg>
<seg id="44">Перестраиваться общепиту had before.</seg>
<seg id="45">For example, at the beginning of 2014, when the EU banned the importation of Australian beef, and the year before - the American and Canadian meat.</seg>
<seg id="46">Suppliers established in return for supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="47">But sanctions лета-2014 were much more serious.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which lifted the ban fry of Atlantic salmon and trout, безлактозное milk, seed potatoes, corn, peas and onions сахарную for replanting.</seg>
<seg id="49">The Italian transfer hopes that sanctions may even смягчиться.</seg>
<seg id="50">As long as there is uncertainty in terms of restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="51">According to the company "East-West", one of the world's largest suppliers of imported products in the premium segment accounted for up to 70%.</seg>
<seg id="52">"Expensive restaurants to change their menus for the produce of local farmers and other countries," says Sergei Mironov, ресторатор, owner of the agency "Рестконсалт."</seg>
<seg id="53">If a chef, for him it's not going to be a problem.</seg>

<seg id="55">Тригель from restaurant "that it is ready to give up: From 10-15%, still half the menu, recycle.</seg>
<seg id="56">In restaurants with a kitchen are starting to replace dishes, for example steak from marble beef - бефстроганов, says Sergei Mironov.</seg>
<seg id="57">"Cheeses from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian and cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," lists the "East-West" Oksana Глибчук.</seg>
<seg id="58">Cream and milk products from Europe have counterparts in Russia and Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="59">Chicken from the United States may be replaced by one from Russia and Belarus, salmon and salmon from Norway, the Queensway, that семгой, from Belarus, and Chile.</seg>
<seg id="60">The lack of fruits and vegetables of European production may be at the expense of domestic production, from Serbia, Moldova and China.</seg>

<seg id="63">The Ginza Project a few dozen restaurants under different brands and with their menu.</seg>

<seg id="69">"In Georgian cuisine there is no expensive products," says Хатуна Колбая, owner of the Georgian restaurants and cafes "Vai however мэ!."</seg>
<seg id="70">All cheeses for us to do in Russia, the basis of many of the dishes - chicken breast, exotic herbs we don't use. "</seg>

<seg id="73">If Russia наладит imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we even win in price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="74">From the CIS can be cheaper to get info, sausages, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit.</seg>

<seg id="91">"East-West" do not deny, "for example, the Belarusian milk products with the lowest 10% to 15%."</seg>
<seg id="92">"The Brazilian suppliers raised prices for pork almost doubled," complained Deputy General Director Sergei Cancer, "Стардогс."</seg>

<seg id="96">Now, and so very undesirable to raise prices, "says Cancer.</seg>
<seg id="97">According to statistics, catering revenue growth for the second quarter of 2014, just 1.8%.</seg>

<seg id="131">"The fish vendors as long as we don't have," is his explanation of the owner of the Bar Killfish Dmitri Evseev.</seg>

<seg id="18">Savings certificate makes the and irrevocable offer</seg>
<seg id="19">The Finance Ministry wants to block savings certificates to the bearer, but will allow banks to make them the безотзывного contribution.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Finance Ministry is preparing a bill that would prohibit savings certificates to the bearer.</seg>
<seg id="21">In recent years, this tool is gaining popularity, as the interest rate is higher than on bank deposits.</seg>
<seg id="22">The fact of the matter is that savings certificates on the bearer not the bank deposit insurance, and they cost less, because they did not have to make payments to the Fund Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA).</seg>
<seg id="23">The situation successfully in the fact that this step will be taken because of the small and medium-sized banks, spreading such certificates, and suffer from Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which, according to the DIA, control 98% of the level of the market.</seg>
<seg id="24">With the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, which is about 3.5%.</seg>
<seg id="25">The problem, explains in the DIA, lies in the fact that a small bank customers, who bought such a certificate, in case of withdrawal of the license is trying to get money in the DIA.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some investors, who do not have sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates to the bearer may assume that their investment is insured.</seg>
<seg id="27">The absence of reasonable insurance payments on these сертификатам in case of license revocation bank can lead to misunderstandings and social tensions.</seg>
<seg id="28">In cases when the agency had tried to seek insurance certificates предъявительских redress through the courts, "the DIA said.</seg>
<seg id="29">The problem, of course, надуманная.</seg>
<seg id="30">The certificates pay buyers still nobody will, because they don't have the right to reimbursement from the state.</seg>
<seg id="31">If the case was that the tool is not immune in the DIA, together with him and would be prohibited and account, which means citizens are in grams of one of the four metals: Gold, silver, platinum and palladium.</seg>
<seg id="32">Since these accounts do not come with deposit insurance, but their existence as long as no one deprives.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is likely that the bearer certificates are a very convenient security, which may actually act as квазиденег.</seg>
<seg id="34">The move does not control: Any customer of the bank can buy a certificate to every citizen, and that can change a encashing a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is not by chance that the draft that savings certificate must be issued to security, which must be stored in depositories.</seg>
<seg id="36">But to banks, such certificates пилюлю allowed out without the right to early repayment.</seg>
<seg id="37">That is a similar безотзывного contribution, which has long been the dream, the bankers.</seg>

<seg id="3">Even on the (the situation around Ukraine тревожному отлагательств does not tolerate), the leaders of the EU and Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of "hot."</seg>
<seg id="4">It is capable of such a structure to work effectively, it is not clear, but it is clear who took the cream from that summit.</seg>
<seg id="5">Questions on this one evening on August 26, when the Belarusians, and after them and other евразийцы with Europeans saw a television news report about the new president.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Belarusian leader revealed an example of polished talent, it was the behavior of a man who had just caught the jackpot - and is planning a decent old age in high society.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Maidan Lukashenko helped</seg>
<seg id="8">Arrival in Minsk at the three main European commissioners (of the EU), who met with Mr. Lukashenko and allowed him to play in the final briefing on their behalf -- not just President легитимация with.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is the subject of a full European policy and the campaign of the Ukrainian crisis.</seg>
<seg id="10">A senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Studies, Denis Мельянцов sure: From now on, it will not have to talk to Minsk in the same tone as before.</seg>
<seg id="11">"The fact that Catherine Ashton met face to face with Lukashenko, gives reason to believe that the relationship with the EU will be размораживаться and beyond," he said "Огоньку."</seg>
<seg id="12">It is a hidden part of the iceberg: Preparing to push the Belarusian authorities began long before November Maidan in Kiev - summer 2013-го.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The results have been achieved and the EU is the successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues about modernization," lists the Ogonyok which - and with the United States have held talks on international security.</seg>
<seg id="14">The United States was even a little bit of sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="15">As for the Ukrainian events that they themselves and the response to them have only invoked another influx of this process.</seg>
<seg id="16">Minsk, on the one hand, we have been able to maintain relations with Ukraine are warm enough to not lose in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for talks.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who admitted not de jure accession of Crimea to Russia and called for the punishment of pro-Russian militia in the Donbas with the severity, and quarreled with Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="18">Minsk came neither from Customs Union, from the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), and if the Russian air base.</seg>
<seg id="19">Brussels and Washington have a balanced position on the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated her, believe the experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">How successful has the political will to diversify, it will be seen by how often the Minsk meeting ever to take to the EU +.</seg>
<seg id="21">The High Representative of the Union for foreign policy and diplomacy Catherine Ashton failed to answer questions about what it wants from the relationship in a new format.</seg>
<seg id="22">A spokesman for Ashton said "the only Косьянчич Огоньку" that decisions on issues of war and peace, this issue is not a priority.</seg>
<seg id="23">While there were reports that following a meeting on the Ukraine issue, with the participation of the people in the new format may be, and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="24">A drop of tar in Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that on this, as it turns out, personally asked representatives of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, at the final briefing Alexander Lukashenko made it clear: All sides don't mind that Minsk was central to the meetings as Россия--ОБСЕ--Украина and at the level of heads of states and representatives of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="26">This means that "the last dictator in Europe" quite рукопожатного acquires the status of European leader that helps to solve a global problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">The European farmer's best friend</seg>
<seg id="28">The EU delegation included еврокомиссаров on trade and energy, in conclusion: The main underlying reason for the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbas, and economy.</seg>
<seg id="29">In fact, the meeting schedule сверстанное future negotiations on the supply of gas and to overcome fear of the CU in the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU appears to be more extensive than peace declaration without specific dates and numbers.</seg>
<seg id="30">Trade Commissioner Karl De Гюхт, nevertheless, on the: EU officials "arrived in Minsk to find solution to the political crisis which has economic consequences, and not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="31">It seems, however, that the economy and the crisis in Ukraine "is working" in Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its consequences - and above all reciprocal sanctions from the West and Russia - from Minsk, who himself is under pressure as the field санкционное, room for maneuver.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to the leader of the Mises Research Centre, the presidents of Belarus Yaroslav Ramanchuk, European investors are actively interested in opportunities for supplies of agricultural products to the Russian Federation to bypass sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="34">Under the proposed scheme, for which President Vladimir Putin at the summit пожурил Minsk.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Billions of these schemes," said Romanchuk "Огоньку," are not the Belarusian businessmen and Russian companies.</seg>
<seg id="36">They worked for a long time, the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Russian businesses urgently need to restore them, even through the mediation of the Belarusian authorities.</seg>
<seg id="38">The second story, "the expert continues," is related to the fact that many Ukrainian companies to establish production of raw materials as well as in Belarus from focusing on the Russian market.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Ukrainian producers about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and the Belarusian производственно-торговые schemes now would be very popular. "</seg>
<seg id="40">According to Ramanchuk, the role of the host site for the negotiations between the EU and the CU is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of the development of economic ties with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="41">He recalls that the loss of the agricultural sector of the EU sanctions against Moscow are estimated at 10 billion euros, and the Commission is currently proposed аграриям only 125 million euros in compensation.</seg>
<seg id="42">The president could offer to Brussels to work together to minimise the consequences for еврофермеров.</seg>
<seg id="43">This could raise the authority of Lukashenko to the EU to unprecedented heights.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hospitality without initiatives</seg>
<seg id="45">Catherine Ashton thanked the authorities for the initiative for the summit.</seg>
<seg id="46">But the paradox is that the birth of his active role in the EU, открещивается + format and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with Ukrainian counterpart emphasized that the new format and it was.</seg>
<seg id="47">"It was your suggestion to come, without any навала discuss, not with бухты-барахты decide, after the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU, to sort out the situation, which at that time was in Ukraine," he said, before the cameras to Peter Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, observers interpreted it as an attempt to calm Moscow, she said, was initially against the mediation, which greatly increases its political weight.</seg>
<seg id="49">In the Belarusian diplomatic establishment, to stress that the cooperation between the EU and Belarus on its land, has not ruled out, but the ultimate goal of this format in the future is the creation of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.</seg>
<seg id="50">"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts which, in other areas, in particular in the field of security, and the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation," the Foreign Ministry said "Огоньку" in Belarus, where the words were chosen very carefully.</seg>

<seg id="4">The sequel to which that class is revolutionary in its own way, in the sense that it is fundamental to modern thinking chain "thesis - антитезис" synthesis "(if you understand thesis and antithesis justify the нуара universe, the cosmos - comic books).</seg>

<seg id="7">Yes, the characters are familiar in the first part of "City," though, громила Марв Рурк (Mickey), I remember, had finished the electric chair, but here, nothing, just to rile people up and, in the role of the national nature of дружинника air knives and axes with удавками.</seg>

<seg id="19">Frank Miller was good in bed as рисовальщик joined comic and нуар, and as a director, turned an idea of how comic books to the screen.</seg>
<seg id="20">Comic and нуар are two aggressively opposing "reality."</seg>

<seg id="29">This novel peacefully wracked the format of the series, and the criminal - that is, by definition, a novel возвысился marginal to the level of philosophical prose.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to Russian news reports about his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government has stopped fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately started negotiations on the "statehood" отделившегося region.</seg>
<seg id="3">His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later discloses that Putin had in mind that восточноукраинская territory under the control of the separatists will become part of Russia, but that her status within Ukraine should be revised to give русскоговорящему region to protect their rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, Mr Putin's call for the Government to start negotiations with the very insurgents пророссийскими as corresponds to the obvious strategy, which it should be from the start of the bloodshed five months ago, to help bring the separatists and the Ukrainian government to force the de facto independence новопровозглашенной Новороссии to closer ties with Russia rather than with the West.</seg>

<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian government could give the eastern regions more autonomy, "said Peskov.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is not a matter for discussion between Russia and Ukraine, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and an internal Ukrainian conflict."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Kremlin's press secretary, to rectify an "incorrect interpretation of the words" Putin stressed the decision of the Russian leadership to behave in relation to the separatist uprising in the east of in any other way than to open the seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the population is ethnic Russians 2-миллионного.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would have to withstand a heavy battle, even the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine and Луганскую, since most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian, and surveys prior to the start of the conflict, showed broad support for the desire to stay within Ukraine.</seg>
