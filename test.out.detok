Reconnecting With the Very American Ideal That Labor Rights Are Human Rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed legislation to the organization of and to join trade unions as a civil etablieren to.
"As go unions, such as, the Minnesota Democrat who serves so go middle-class jobs," says Ellison, a Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair.
That's why I'm proud to introduce Empowerment Act with civil rights icon John Lewis the Employee Empowerment Act.
This ground-breaking legislation will give workers the same legal options for union organizing discrimination as for other forms of discrimination - stopping anti-union forces in their tracks
Amending the National Labor Relations Act to a discrimination ausgesetzte organization to give workers Gewerkschaftsvertretung a union organizing to sue for justice in the civil courts - and to collect compensatory and punitive damages - is a sound and necessary initiative.
But it in certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.
Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the cosponsors of their Gesetzesvorlage vorschlagen a very American idea.
Despite the battering that unions have taken in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and states across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to embrace, extend and respect labor rights.
There was a time, within the living memory of millions of Americans, when this country championed democracy, freedom of speech Pressefreiheit, and the right to organize in the same breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his aides encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to assure that Hideki Tojo's militarized autocracy would be replaced with democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their unions had in shaping the new Japan had a role to play, they included language that explicitly recognized that "the right of workers to organize and to bargain and act collectively is guaranteed."
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides urged the Germans to write a constitution that would assure that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced with muscular democracy.
That workers would need to organize Recognizing and make their voices heard in the new nation, the Germans included a provision that explicitly declared: "The right to form associations to safeguard improve working and economic conditions shall be guaranteed and to every individual and to every occupation or profession.
Agreements that this in answer to a presentation given by the einschränken or seek to impair null and void; measures directed to this end shall be unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that would in 1948 be adopted by the United Nations as a global covenant, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that "everyone has the right, there is no obligation to join trade unions for the protection of his interests to form and to join trade".
For generations, Americans accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When this country counseled other countries on how to forge civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize a trade union - and to have that trade union engage in collective bargaining as an equal partner with corporations and government agencies - had to be protected.
After those rights under in America Beschuss gerieten does it is very weise that he should get in touch with the American Ideal again, when it comes to questions about technology, to demzufolge, the American ideal that working people must have a right to organize and make their voices heard in a free and open society.
As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not diminish the strength of the nation but enlarged it.
But with the Anhebung Lebensstandards of the people of millions, labor miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to undreamed of levels of production.
Those who attack labor forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers, as should we.
The formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protections to prevent discrimination against labor organizing - is long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing ideals that have historically enlarged America and made real the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily blocks law that could close all Louisiana abortion clinics
A U.S. federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked enforcement of a Louisiana law that advocates say would likely have closed all five abortion clinics in the state.
Jindal of the law by Louisiana Governor Bobby in June and measure, who was born in Munich on 1 signed into effect Sept. The, would doctors who perform abortions to have a patient admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of their erwerben to GP's surgery.
However, the judge's ruling means that for the time being doctors can continue to perform legal abortions while seeking such privileges.
"Plaintiffs will be gesetzeskonform can weiterarbeiten to obtain privileges," Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in the decision.
A hearing will be scheduled within a month for the judge to make a more permanent ruling on the law.
Abortion rights activists applauded the decision, the latest in a string of rulings against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to seek hospital privileges.
"Today's ruling ensures Louisiana women are safe from an underhanded law that seeks to strip them of their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued names of three of the state's five clinics to block the law aufzuhalten.
It was not immediately clear whether the ruling applied to doctors from the two clinics who were not plaintiffs in the suit and have also applied for admitting privileges.
Louisiana is among 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently ruling unconstitutional such measures in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of a in Texas law that would have shuttered most in the state verbliebenen clinics forced to shut down, then State President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion rights campaigners, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say admitting privileges laws impose medically unnecessary requirements on doctors.
Anti-abortion advocates have countered that the measures aim to protect women's health, though some have also lauded their effect of shuttering clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has hospital admitting privileges, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions, would, are already staying at home for fear that doctor, fearful for his safety the procedure, the group said.
In arguing against the ruling, Louisiana officials said they will not punish doctors performing abortions said they would not, while their applications for admitting privileges were pending.

Angelina Jolie and her brother James have posted a video tribute to their late mother who died of Ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women living in rural Australia are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their city counterparts.

Older women and those whose cancer was more advanced at the time of diagnosis had the poorest survival rates.
Those living in regional and abgelegenen in the state regions lebten likely to die during the study about 20 per cent more than those in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr Jordan suggested delayed diagnosis and inability to access best treatment might be factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynaecological oncology surgeons and they're mostly based in major cities," she said.
Despite improving tele-medicine services to lessen the Entfernungen something entgegenzusetzen, she suggested more fly-in to fly-out of to of to allow specialists to treat women closer to home and programs to support people treatment away from their communities could help.
Dr Jordan said that the study unabhängig of geographical status long-term survival among women with ovarian cancer was poor, reinforcing the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The research, funded by the Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer finanzierte will study today in the Medical Journal of Australia published.
In March 2012 erfuhr 2013 Elisha Neave, a young mother given punishments like, for example, at 33 years of age, that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.

Matthies thinks: High time for the Internet Of Things
Faced with technical Fortschritts, the mechanics of how we behagliches Zuhause in High-Tech-Schaltzentralen to turn our homes into high-tech control rooms, our reporter, Bernd Matthies, takes heart from a vertrauten electronics Zubehör.
As I write this, my eye catches the spiral cable, which connects the handset to the telephone, and I'm thinking: Wow! How retro is that then?
But it started me thinking a: If the cable was not there, would be in no time sämtliche Hörer herrenlos in the house - and that would be even more retro.
In any case, in the elephantine (elephantine?
No - a typing error - electronics) sector, the basic rule is that the latest wonder of today is electronic rubbish tomorrow - veraltet.
And anyone, for example, who still Röhrenfernseher a living in the, is merely announcing to the world that they're not interested in TVs!
So why these thoughts?
The us how incompetent we are when it, who was born in Munich on the International Electronics Fair (our again) in Berlin, once when it comes to questions about technology.
The layman, who once knew, blind washing machine and a CD-Player, is today did not get, the purpose of which he doesn't even understand faced with highfalutin expert talk about an array doesn't even understand. "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies," are what the press office promise us.
Yes - and?
What do you say to people, who clearly talk such guff voluntarily?
Really, they've been a more earthy nature - for the last 20 years of Things for our homes, trying to sell us.
So the Maldives - that your yoghurt can place itself on your shopping list you're lying on the beach in that your fire-alarm can tell you - that there's a fire in your study back home.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we could set our home air-conditioning to get back from the office to switch on just before we get...?
Yes - but that presupposes that the setzt, a Klimaanlage voraus.
However, one dream really will come true very soon: We lift our wrist watches, and in a loud voice say "Vacuum!" - and at home the vacuum cleaner robot begins to hoover.
Fantastic.
Everything is geared to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundary between white and brown goods is becoming blurred," mutters an industry insider. You can connect your washing machine to your headphone; your steam oven can, as well as the if you're sitting in a; and your data-goggles can tell you how long your pizza still has oven - but that's of little traffic jam.
From everyday experience, we also know: If you need a new model gadget to urgently work, the battery will almost certainly be empty.
Which is another reason why the spiral cable on the telephone will out-live the next IFA exhibits in Berlin.
Israeli Children Return to School After after the war, it turns out Gaza back schools their
Thousands of Israeli children in areas near the same Gazastreifens Monday after spending the summer in bomb shelters as rockets and mortars rained on their communities during the 50-day Israel-Hamas war, the while schools in Gaza remained shuttered as the territory recovered from the fighting.
The to start of school rocket-scarred communities in southern brought a sense of joy and Erwartung, but the signs of the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees at the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was struck by a rocket, removed shrapnel marks off the walls from the Schiebewänden and.
"We are a little scared but we are excited," said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and an English teacher in its school.
A lot of children in our area really need to go back to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it felt a "little bit weird" to suddenly be going back to school.
"There were some difficult times and we didn't leave our houses at all," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz, which is located close to the Gaza border, to offer his support.
Until a cease-fire halted the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad remained indoors or left their homes for safer areas further away from Gaza to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community close to the Gaza frontier where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are hesitant about coming back.
The Education Ministry said about a dozen families still had not returned.
Their children have been placed in alternate schools for the time being.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a Gaza border town that has been hard hit by Palestinian fire.
He urged the children to study hard and said "we will make sure to provide you with knowledge and provide you with security."
Israel and Hamas agreed to an open-ended truce last Tuesday.
The cease-fire brought an immediate end to the fighting but left key issues unresolved, such as the Hamas' demand for the lifting of an Israel-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's air and seaports.
Israel wants Hamas to disarm and the return of bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
The war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children, according to Palestinian and U.N. estimates.
Israel disputes the figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were militants, has not provided firm evidence to back its claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.
Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mortars at Israeli cities during the fighting, mostly in the south.
The Israeli military, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people took refuge in more than 100 U.N. schools turned into makeshift shelters.
With tens of thousands of people still in the shelters and fighting still raging, education officials delayed year last week, as well as the start of the school.
"I hope the school will open's soon to complete our education, just like the children in the world and Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy staying in a Gaza City school.
Following the election in Saxony: CDU Vice-Chairman Strobl questions NPD-banning process
In view of the Stimmenverluste of the NPD, in Saxony, the national CDU-Vice-Chairman, Thomas Strobl, has called for an end of the current NPD-Verbotsverfahrens in the German Federal Constitutional Court.
Berlin - According to CDU National Vice-Chairman, Thomas Strobl, should, the current trial against the NPD in the German Federal Constitutional Court to an end.
"The the NPD performed worse than last time," said Strobl, who is also CDU regional boss in Baden-Württemberg to the "Leipziger Volkszeitung,".
That is a good development in the right towards, and this trend leads me to think that that we should fight the NPD politisch bekämpft and not in the constitutional court.
The, the Abstimmung on Sunday scarce across the (the Lefties Fünf-Prozent-Hürde.
A first attempt at securing a ban of the right-wing extremist party failed in 2003, because of the Verfassungsschutz then also had informants in the top echelons of the NPD.
In December 2013 the Bundesrat to the constitutional court, which is submitted a further banning action based in Karlsruhe, after spending a long time preparing the case.
The German government and Bundestag did not take part in the banning submission.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
Refugees at Neuländer Platz will now be accommodated in tents.
The reception centre for refugees in Harburg is full-to-bursting.
Now, the Red Cross to erect the three tents German Internal Affairs Authority now given the go-ahead for.
The Bezirkspolitiker only were just from a previously peaceful area in the middle of - and they are not happy.
"These one-off actions only stir up more doubts in the minds of the public a, and they give the local politicians no chance to, constructive plan of how to house refugees in a humane manner," said, for example, Britta Herrmann, Chairwoman of the Green Party in the Harburg district assembly.
Her party is calling on the Harburg district authority to deploy empty houses to accommodate the refugees.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the over-crowding in the initial reception centres are mainly the Ansturm Hilfesuchenden of - and, as well as the fact that the authorities cannot make available enough places in suitable accommodation.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the regular three months.
Housing prices have posted their strongest winter gain in seven years, according to a widely-watched gauge.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic home value index of Australian capital city dwelling prices rose by 1.1 per cent in August, RP data said on Monday.
The rise brought the total gain over the June, July and August to 4.2 per cent, the biggest rise over the winter months since 2007.
Annual growth in at 10.9 per cent, more than double the gain of the 12 months to August 2013, but the gains were not evenly spread across the country.
The RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two tier market.
The RP Data figures show Sydney home prices in the past year rose by 16.1 per cent, while Melbourne's were up by 11.7 per cent.
The next strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with price rises averaging between five and six per cent.
At the other end of the is Skala Canberra, which was wrongfully denied by Einschnitten in the state Ausgaben hart and was where prices rose by through the year by only 1.4 per cent.
Mr Lawless said that now spring has begun there for the next few months be a rise in of properties for sale over listings of properties, who was going to the market a "real test" for the time I was.
"Considering the ongoing high rate of auction clearance rates, a generally rapid rate of sale and the ongoing low interest rate environment, it's likely that dwelling values will rise even further over the next three months," he said.
In an announcement to the regional German newspaper 'die Neue Presse' Pötzl contradicted the comments of managing director, Peer Medau, said that the latter was behaving like, "a" military general.
The Stil of the college, he was not that.
He said that the Medau family June "were informed about the plans of the college in the middle of.
The say that they only learned of the plans in July are simply wrong to say, "he said.
At the same time he also said that the plans were not about "final decisions already made," but rather about "stating preferences".
Said that the building work to widen the narrow access road up to the castle would not be as radical as the Medaus feared.
From a matter of a nine metre-wide road was not - and will not be.
It's current nature center stand, they got to 5,50 to meter, which is one metre wider than before, "explained Pötzl.
Pötzl refutes the Medau-Betreiber that their kostenfreien belong schuleigenen and in future only be available by the college students, for.
It won't be a case of everywhere being parked up, because it, as for other public Parkplätzen mittlerweile clever lösen one that should make us.
Think of the neighbours
The children's nursery Bergwichtel, which is situated on the space in question, and in front of the front door of which the access road to the parking level will run, is, according to the college president "not to be impacted".
He is far more concerned to point out "that it's not only an issue concerning the children's nursery, rather it is about the people who live by the entrance to Friedrich-Streib-Strasse and the 800 schoolchildren of the adjacent secondary school.
It's therefore about a lot more than the individual interests of the Medau gentlemen, "he said.
Whether the criticism by the parents' association for the children's nursery is correct that the extension of the road will lead to "one of the few remaining natural spaces in Coburg being lost" readers, "he said the can decide for themselves."
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the Bamberg regional building authority, plans to present his plans of development of the college up to 2020 "and Zusammenhang this in the importance of the extension work."
Peer Medau informed the parents of the children's nursery about the plans, last week.
Accordingly, the access for the new parking level will not now lead, as before, via the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Strasse, but rather via the Medau-Berg.
Thus, the narrow road must be widened into two lanes over a stretch of about one kilometre.
According to higher estimates of the Medaus, the traffic in the Hohenfels castle park would increase ten-fold.
From a more earthy nature - for example Fahrzeugen 2,000 day is not.

Due to the strong start to the year, figures for first half-year GDP were up 0.8 percent from the second quarter of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of "Münsterland-Mooiste", which lead through the city on Sunday.
The city of Horstmar experienced on Sunday an invasion of Dutch "Fietzen riders".
The largest cycling federation in Holland, NTFU, staged the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
In other words, the largest bike ride straight through Münsterland, a bike rider's paradise close to Holland.
By registering, more than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for having organized this tour through Münsterland.
The tour was advertised in several professional journals, and offered to those interested.
We are from Den Helder, and overnight are gefahren to take part in the tour.
We would also like to get know Münsterland a bit better in way ", the cyclists eagerly said, looking forward to the route through the Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registering at the fraternity's club house, Sta.
Katharina started off with a small "peace ride" through the city and over the embankment, which is also where the start line was.
Then, the route, which was for three different categories, headed in the direction of Herrenholz via Schöppinger Berg towards Coesfeld, in, passing by Havixbeck and Billerbeck, and back to Horstmar.
The riders prove just how good a shape they are in: Stretches of 95 kilometers at an altitude of 1175 meters, 120 kilometers with an altitude of 1475 meters, and 145 kilometers with an altitude of 1775 meters.
They were fed and watered on their way back in Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
Chief organizer, Jos ter Huerne, and deputy mayor, Heinz Lölfing seemed to Gelingen with the success of this Radsport-Events very erfreut.
We are happy, and it was a wonderful experience for all participants.
The organization went smoothly, with no issues, and there were no nasty incidents ", Heinz Lölfing positively concluded with regard to the event.
Unfortunately, there were not as many participants as the organizer had hoped for, which is presumably because of the bad weather forecast and the morning rain.
"We shall see each other in 2015, hopefully with nice weather, on either 30 August, or on another weekend", the riders promised, but whatever the weather, they will return to Münsterland, and the organizers will plan a repeat.
Konstantin Wecker - scrupulously honest memoirs
It is really more a statement of philosophy than it is a Konstantin Wecker, song writer, pacifist, political activist and, 287-page "Monk and Warrior" by.
Composed more as a collection of thought-provoking ideas rather than a chronological history, the author, who was born in Munich on 1 June 1947, has provided every chapter with an accompanying suitable song-text.
And he has been unstintingly honest throughout: From masturbating as a grammar school pupil to shoplifting and drug-taking, he has left none of his human weaknesses untold.
And this was also a means to explain why he is now come to be so tolerant towards his fellow man.
As a result, abstract concepts, clearer, more important meaning a: Love; Soul; Ego; Existing in the Here and Now; Spirituality - he seeks, which he liberally uses throughout the text, to be able to secure municipal funds to, in a highly philosophical, but also very personal way.
And he explains why he is pacifist; what lies behind his criticism of society his his political heart and soul; and ideas have been shaped and moulded - and also a means to explain why not only by music (he was an opera lover who became a soul and rock musician) but by his prison experience, too.
He says that the latter experience gave him a closer understanding of the life of the monks, who live their lives by a process of "subtraction" whereby they "rid themselves of all things superfluous."
In-between all the highbrow stuff, there are also short anecdotes of a more earthy nature - for example, fist-fights in a bar frequented by GIs, or else a crazy drive on the motorway, in which he drove full-on straight into a tree.
Football break. The unfortunate circumstances that he is considering schonungslos honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children born to Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry is rehearsing a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and has grown out of the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap and the tunes are upbeat.
But Henry has had to work through some difficult memories of childhood.
There was "a lot" of therapy after his mother died and Henry is reflective about his relationship with his father.
He was very unknowable.
You never saw his face, you just heard his voice: 'Stop the noise.
Leave your sister alone.
Move!
I want to watch the cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were grown-up when I was a kid - went with him in the pub and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass the beauty of the stroke cricket.
I never had a conversation with him.
He for a lot of my life was this unsmiling bloke in the corner, reading the paper for a.
Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in his father's day, he got a snapshot of what life like for him must have been.
It's a bit brighter now but they're dark, smoky, Stygian labyrinthine depths with bursts of flame and smoke and lots of soot.
My dad used to get in the just Wanne and you'd hear him slowly start to sing to himself because he would wash the foundry off him,.
When I walked round it, I realised that he had done that for years and years to put food on the table, and my estimation of him went up.
None the less, Henry emerged from a childhood stripped of parental affection.
My dad never did hugging, never said, 'I love you'.
It wasn't until my mum was poorly near the end of her life that we started saying 'I love you, I love you, I love you.
Having a daughter of his own, Billie, with Dawn French, enabled him to share the love he missed as a child.
Could you stop with the "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Dawn French.
Why wouldn't I be friends with Dawn?
She's a great mum.
He's still very good friends with French, to whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn's a good person.
Why wouldn't I be friends with Dawn?
She's a great mum.
Henry's own mother was diabetic.
It was one of the things that killed.
So when I became very, very overweight and started getting diabetic symptoms, my doctor said, 'You've got to be radical.
So I went on a big fitness thing, and I also had to go on a drastic diet to the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's tedious.
Nobody likes eating carrots.
Henry's change in career trajectory is, perhaps, reflected in his distinguished, close-cropped beard.
Since he won critical acclaim for his Othello, he has become engrossed in the theatre.
Comedy of Errors followed, as did Fences by August Wilson.
It's a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have upholstered his busy working life.
He started out when he was just 16 and working at a factory.
A DJ spotted him on stage doing impressions and wrote to New Faces about him.
His TV career was launched in the mid-Seventies: "For quite a long time I was the only black impressionist / comedian on telly."
He learnt on the job.
I had not only up in the public eye, but also have to grow to learn how to I would have to be an efficient joke-delivering mechanism between 1975, a star, being on television and it was really difficult.
Lenny on New Faces in 1975
Because his manager owned the stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment programme in which people "blacked up," Henry found himself performing his comedy in it for five years.
My family were very uncomfortable about it.
I sort of wish it had never happened, but I don't regret that I did it.
It was a weird, reprehensible position to be in, I was working in huge venues and learning how to work a crowd.
But what was an "award-winning light entertainment staple of British television for years and years" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."
Introducing characters who the, who both lampooned and celebrated black British culture, Henry worked alternative comedy circuit in the Eighties.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the Nineties he was known as, among other things, chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
Advertisements, documentaries, TV series and parts in films consumed his next decade but after his BBC-Serie a LennyHenry.tv, he thought: "What are you going to do next, Len, because it all feels a bit like you're marking time or you're slightly going sideways."
What came next was a Radio 4 documentary series called What's So Great About...?
The first was on Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy to Shakespeare.
I wasn't really taught it at school never middle-class gelernt and thought it was very much the reserve of white people with tights and a Kohlkopf vorne we could.
So I was very frightened of it.
Everybody we interviewed on that show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, 'You should try it.
Don't slag it off if you don't know what you're talking about.
Get some of the words in your mouth and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry delivered 20 lines of Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was hooked.
It gave me the feeling that I could do it.
It's almost like I had my head put on straight for me.
'This is what it's about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your lines, do some research.
So the rehearsal process was brutal and I las monatelang piece this, before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car crash and it didn't quite happen.
Soon he was starring in Comedy of Errors.
Suddenly I'm at the National Theatre and I just couldn't quite believe it.
There was one moment where I thought, 'Oh, you've changed. ""
There was a technical fault and Henry instinctively felt that it was his job to keep the audience entertained.
"A little voice inside me said, 'You're going to have to do 10 minutes while they fix the computer." "
Instead the performance verkündete that would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something in me went, "Oh, thank God".
It's not my responsibility.
I can let somebody else sort it out.
'You're in a play, stay in character. ""
Henry appearing in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning his lines for Fences was challenging.
Panic's quite good, it stiffens the sinews.
That was well received too, so it's like a big sign from the gods, saying, 'This is what you should be doing. ""
He says this, of course, in a BOOMING voice.
So I'm sticking with it.
I'm really loving it.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
Henry still has a comedian's brain, though - the mechanics of how we conversation is broken with flashes of his humour as he slips in and out of impressions.
I'm just choosing not to do stand-up because that thing of getting instant gratification from a room full of Fremder is dangerous.
If you're constantly seeking that it can lead to a brick wall.
I do Live at the Apollo sometimes when I want to, but generally it doesn't float my boat like it used to.
I ask whether he'll ever do another stand-up tour.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who, who is helping to shape a beginning, middle and end of a journey - I don't think I'll ever want to give that up.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like being an actor.
It's good fun.
You're always telling a story and that's a great place to be.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Houthi rebels block roads in Yemeni capital

Kenya registers civil servants to target 'ghost workers'
Kenya has started Staatsbeamten all biometrisch to remove "ghost workers" from the government's payroll.
Employees who failed to register over the next two weeks would no longer be paid, a government statement said.
The government suspects that thousands of people to after leaving the civil service receive salaries continue.
President Uhuru Kenyatta pledged to curb corruption in the public service after taking office in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1m (£700,000) a month was lost in payments to "ghost workers" and other financial malpractice.
The government suspects that salaries continue to be deposited into bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves the public service, reports the BBC's Wanyama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All public servants are required to present themselves over the next two weeks at identification centres to ensure their data is captured through the biometric registration exercise, a government statement said.
Anyone who failed to do so without a valid excuse would be eliminated from the payroll, it said.
"This exercise will contribute significantly to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual numbers of public servants and will also be used to cleanse the payroll at both levels of government- hence bring a stop to the issue of 'ghost workers'," said Anne Waiguru, the cabinet secretary in the Ministry of Devolution and Planning.

Children need roots and wings
School teacher for 44 years, he was, a school in the principal.
During his teaching time, Manfred Richter got to know many gestandene Petershausener and Kollbach.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but they were always based on his desire to see the adult in the child.
Mount Sněžka is one of the best-known peaks in the Czech Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves this painting of a picture from his childhood home.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau / Nordböhmen, today's Trutnov.
He was interested in the age of 14, after he had been a secondary school pupil for four years ago, as well as the in becoming a teacher as early as.
One year later the Germans living in the Sudetenland were dispossessed.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months spent in a holding camp, they moved to Bavaria in 1946 - in a goods train.
That was how he came to live in Senkendorf, in Upper Franconia.
The teacher training course was in Bamberg.
In order to get to the school, Manfred Richter had to go six times per week on foot to the Bahn to Bamberg; from there walk three kilometres right across the town to the school; and then make the return journey home.
After two months. Manfred Richter was given the Red Cross Home in Bamberg, a bed that he shared with 15 to sleep at the Schlafsaal in a.
In 1951, he took his first state exam, and 1954, after spending three further years as a teaching candidate second.
With Oberfranken for him freie don't Lehrerstelle, he applied to Upper Bavaria and received a post on 1 November 1954 at a school in Kollbach.
The "Young Women's Room" was his first "Service Flat" in the school building.
In 1958, he moved into the new-build teacher accommodation next door to the school, into a three-room service flat.
Manfred Richter bought this house in 1980, after the school in Kollbach was closed in 1968.
Until then, there are in Kollbach the school district association of Petershausen-Kollbach had three Klassen and five in Petershausen.
In the school year of 1968 / 69, these classes were accommodated in Petershausen, in today's town hall.
When the Indersdorf Schools Association was founded, the only school left in the locality was the primary school.
Order to avoid a deranking of position in the now smaller school, the then dean, Georg Sigl decided to move to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
However, Petershausen continued to grow, and so the children and their teachers, from September 1982 onwards, could move into the present-day building, which has since been extended, after Richter took his retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated manner and spirit of generosity of the then Mayor, Ludwig Götz, who was able to secure municipal funds to build an additional work-room and extra rooms in the cellar as part of the 1997 extensions - although the council guidelines governing school-building work did not allow subsidies to be used to.
"Mayor Götz was a great friend of the school," recalls Richter, with gratitude.
Throughout his whole career, Manfred Richter never forgot a reply given the, in a speech by a government representative to a presentation given by law and justice: "One should never forget to love". Manfred Richter duly implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.
"One has to give children two things: Roots and wings," says the 84 year-old.
But experience has also taught him that: "One doesn't always achieve that." Whether by that he means his pupils or his own six children, is unclear.
In any case Richter was Tun sometimes unconventional.
If school children got into fights, they were not given punishments like, for example, for example, writing out lines or serving a Strafarbeit, and also were not the Nachsitzen verdonnert.
At the cost of the council, Richter bought two pairs of boxing gloves, and then let the two antagonists fight it out, even if this did occasionally produce a black-eye.
For the benefit of the school, Richter nurtured a good relationship with the then Mayor, Ludwig Götz (CSU).
Following his retirement, Richter, who had no political allegiances, was encouraged by the Mayor to run for election onto the local council as a candidate for the CSU in 1996.
However, Richter finished in sixth and joined the CSU.
180 kilometres in three days
HR4-CYCLE 700 Fahrradfahrer to in the resort of Bad Salzhausen and Schotten
Of the ordinary about rest in Bad Salzhausen or Schotten about touring cyclists take a to There is nothing particular out.
On Friday, the sheer numbers of those resting up was striking: The 700 participants of the started samt Begleittross enjoying a break in the lower resort of Bad Salzhausen, and they would later be attending an open air party in the Alteburgpark in Schotten, too.
Under the logo "Cycling and celebrating along the newly-discovered routes between Nidda and Kinzig," the participants had met up on Thursday in Bad Vilbel and had listened to a concert there by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it was down to business: The riders set out to attack the first stage - 60 kilometres via Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and then further on to Schotten.
In Bad Salzhausen, the sportsmen-and-women were greeted by mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had ridden off the start-line in Bad Vilbel on his own bike, and the boss of the municipal company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
All sorts of food and drink had been prepared, to refresh body and mind: The local women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 apple-, plum- and cheesecakes - as well as streusel cake which the intrepid riders let melt in their mouths.
"Such cakes only the local women can make," praised the rider from Aulendiebach, at the same time as he ordered another slice.
At the drinks stand of the Geiß-Nidda gymnasium club, the riders could acquire cold drinks.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from Operettas and Musicals and reaped enthusiastic applause.
The lovely atmosphere in the Park had a relaxing effect.
One gentleman even received a head-massage from his lady partner: "The, he had to fix a bicycle chain that had come off, after all, he had to fix it - He earlier in the day."
Meanwhile, the mayor and the company boss still had work to do: They were interviewed at the fountain in front of the watering-hole inn, by reporter, Rainer Janke, and took their in up for Bad Salzhausen werben to.
Even head of promotions, Tobias Hagen, since the first started in 2004, who had worked as tour head, could only verschnaufen just, he had a lot of work to do involving the local technology.
His pick-up truck, in which he used three telephones and a radio to communicate with his colleagues and a 15-strong Hessen Police team; made Facebook entries and also wrote his reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of riders come from the Rhein-Main-Region," he explained, "but riders have also come from Gießen and Fulda, from Lauterbach or from the Taunus and even from many towns in Westfalia.
The number of participants depends a little on the number of places where they can stay.
Category 1 riders are accommodated in hotels, with Category 2 riders being put up in hostel-style lodging.
As the out again on the riders set a good impression and happy memories of them, and happy memories of the resort: "Bye!"
"It was very nice in Bad Salzhausen!" They shouted, as they waved goodbye.
After arriving in Schotten, the group could take a short rest.
But then in the evening, the riders were requested to go to the idyllic Alteburgpark.
Under the guidance of manager of the Schotten Association for Tourism and Town Marketing (GTS) the Park had acquired a lovely festive ambience and, of course, there were plenty of nice nibbles, such as Flammkuchen with well-chilled Federweißer wine, too.
Mayoress Susanne Schaab, GTS-boss, Markus Hoßfeld and MSC-Chairman, Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs, in his capacity as board member of the Hessen-Thüringen section of the ADAC welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly delighted by the "roaring trade in Schotten."
DJ Tobias Hagen opened the dancing stage.
The cyclists were happy to have the chance to show off their dancing movements in the open air - despite their sporting feats on their bicycles earlier in the day.

On the second day of the tour program, the riders would call at the stopping points of Birstein; Wächtersbach; and Bad Orb - including a concert with the Trenkwaldern.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometres of cycling, the sportsmen-and-women arrived back in Bad Vilbel once again.
Tens of Turkish Policemen Arrested over 'Plotting' against Gov't
A total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicions of 'plotting against the government', local media outlets say.
Police officials have not immediately commented.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Hurriyet Daily News.

Not all children in Ukraine back to school
Schools across most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (September 1), after the summer holidays.
The day is traditionally a big one for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseny Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
While there, he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was the country for future generations: Committed to defending
The first of September ceremony was not held in every school.
The - überall is not about a peaceful protest of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge joint Ukrainian's people's front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow Schulleiter, the head teacher of Slaviansk School, which Slawjansk Slaviansk School, attended by Yatsenyuk's daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day back at school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing embroidered shirts, carrying balloons and giving flowers to their teachers.
In Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the formidable chief it needs.
She comes trailing clouds of glory from the world of banking, media management and the inner conclaves of the Tory party.
Indeed, she has had frontline experience of her own.
Her career began at global management consultants Bain and Co, then progressed via Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She was seven years chief executive of the Financial Times for, resigning when its parent company Pearson's went to the top job at its parent company to a junior male colleague.
Her pay-off is said to be close to £1 million.
Her political rating is sturdy, too.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former head of BP, when he was looking to bring private expertise into Whitehall: She became a cabinet office adviser.
Her husband is a former Tory councillor.
Back in May, I described the chairman's job as a poisoned chalice.
Not only is the BBC a vast and complex entity at the heart of public life, but there is an inner paradox to its structure.
The trust faces in two directions: Inwards as the upper tier of the BBC's own management hierarchy, but also outwards as the voice of public concern and disquiet when things go awry.
This is an almost untenable duopoly calling for complete root-and-branch reform.
But what incoming chairman would risk coming in, crashing around and dismantling an institution auseinanderzunehmen, according to the komplex is as a Chinese dynasty in case they put themselves out of a job process.
It's a difficult call.
And that weren't tough enough, people are keen to see the BBC cut down in size - its power, its finances and its status overhauled.
As competitors circle ever closer and new technology challenges cosy old certainties, the imminent negotiation of the licence for the BBC fee is fraught with especial danger.
For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public buys into what is surely the greatest media enterprise in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: It claims that its output reaches 96 per cent of households, and costs each one of them just 40p a day.
What's more, apparently the Beeb's popularity is rising: 53 per cent support today as against 31 per cent 10 years ago.
Patterns of watching and using the BBC have changed: I receive news headlines on my mobile phone these days, and catch up on missed programmes with iPlayer.
But it remains a much-loved and formidable institution.
It needs a formidable chairman - I hope it has found one.
Texas' Perry Says Disparaging Tweet Unauthorized
A tweet from's verified account Republican Texas Gov. Rick Perry on Sunday night included a disparaging image of the Democratic, which was one of the center of his criminal indictment on charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another from Perry's account that disavowed the post.
A tweet just went out from my account that was unauthorized.
"I do not condone the tweet and I have taken it down," the later post said.
Perry aides did not immediately return messages seeking comment.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry's verified account, it was unclear who does the actual posting for the feed.
The earlier tweet posted an unflattering mock image of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted in April 2013 of drunken driving.
Perry vetoed funds a to her office when she refused to resign, which led to a charges indicting Perry - who Präsidentschaftskandidat 2016 might be to blame - a grand jury investigation in Austin this month.
The caption on the tweet reads: "I don't always drive drunk at 3x the legal blood alcohol limit... but when I do, I indict Gov. Perry for calling me out about it."
I am the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office did not lead the grand jury investigation against Perry.
It was handled by Michael McCrum, a San Antonio-based special prosecutor who was assigned by a Republican judge.
Perry has pleaded not guilty and called the charges a political ploy.
His high-powered legal team has asked the registered with with the case, Richter betrauten the indictment, claiming that the law being used to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutionally vague.
Perry cut off $7.5 million in state funds to the state's Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and prosecutes public corruption in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
That veto drew a formal complaint from a left-leaning watchdog group.
Perry's verified account is updated frequently - and sometimes famously.
After finishing in the place in the Iowa caucuses during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry addressed speculation that he with a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a Sees call it quits, and the words, "Here we come South Carolina!"

Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual Academy Awards.
Nude photos of Oscar-winning actress Jennifer Lawrence have been leaked online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of 100 other starlets.
A representative for the star of "The Hunger Games" confirmed the photos of Lawrence were real and blasted the hacker for "a flagrant violation of privacy."
The authorities have been contacted and will prosecute anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which originally were posted on the image-sharing site 4chan, were obtained through a weakness in Apple's iCloud online storage system of, and a purported "master list" of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It is not clear how many of the images are authentic, though star Winstead took to "Scott Pilgrim vs. the World" Twitter to denounce the hack as well.
"To those of you looking at photos my husband is, therefore, something that I years ago in the privacy of our home feel great about yourselves, hope you feel great about took with," Winstead tweeted.
However, Victoria Justice, of the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious," denied that the photos were of her, tweeting, "These so called nudes of me are FAKE people.
Let me nip this in the bud right now. * pun intended *.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied that purported photos of her were authentic.
Exclusive extract from Howard Jacobson's acclaimed new novel about love and the letter 'J'
They dissolved, that was the best way of putting it, they gradually came apart like a Karton, the in the rain we are has.
Just occasionally a woman told him he was too serious, hard-going, intense, detached, and maybe a bit prickly.
And then shook his hand.
He recognised prickly.
He was spiny, like a hedgehog, yes.
The latest casualty of this spininess was an embryo-affair that had given greater promise usual of relieving the lonely tedium of his life as, and perhaps even bringing him some content.
Ailinn Solomons was a wild-haired, quiveringly delicate beauty with a fluttering heart from a northern on the Nordinsel, which is still even more remote and rugged than Port Reuben.
She was with an older companion to come south companion whom Kevern took to be her aunt, the latter having been left a property in a wet but paradisal valley called felicitously, Paradise Valley.
By registering, more than several years one had lived in the house for.
The pipes leaked, there were spiders still in the baths, slugs had signed their signatures on all the windows, believing and the place belonged to them, the garden was with weeds that resembled giant cabbages.
It was like a children's story cottage, threatening and enchanting at the same time, the garden full of secrets.
Author's view: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is longlisted for the Man Booker Prize 2014.
The shortlist is announced next week
Kevern had been sitting holding hands with Ailinn on broken deckchairs in the long grass, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, the pair of them absent-mindedly plugged into the utility console that supplied the country with soothing music and calming news, when the sight of her crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black entertainer his father liked listening to with the cottage blinds.
Your feet's too big.
On account of their innate aggressiveness, songs of that sort were no longer played on the console.
Not banned - nothing was banned exactly - simply not played.
Encouraged to fall into desuetude, like the word desuetude.
Popular taste did what edict and proscription could never have done, and just as, when it came to the people chose rags-to-riches memoirs, cookbooks and romances, so, when it came to music, they chose ballads.
Carried away by the day, Kevern began to play at an imaginary piano and in a rudely comic voice serenade Ailinn's big feet.
Ailinn didn't understand.
"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he told her, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.
This his father had always done to stifle the letter j before it left his lips.
It had begun as a game between them when he was small.
His father had played it with his own father, he'd told him.
Begin a word with a j without remembering to put two fingers across your mouth and it cost you a penny.
It had not been much fun then and it was not much fun now.
He knew it was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard any.
Jazz, too, without exactly being proscribed, wasn't played.
Improvisation had fallen out of fashion.
There was room for only one "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure, when a tune began, exactly where it was going to end.
Wit, the same.
Its unpredictability unsettled people's nerves.
And jazz was wit expressed musically.
Though he reached age of 10 without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, one of, when it comes to have a bit Kevern knew of jazz from his father of his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she was unlikely to have remembered a time, when popular singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or duress.
A compliant society meant that every section of it consented with gratitude - the gratitude of the providentially spared - to the principle of group aptitude.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suited by temperament and physique to entertainment and athletics, and so they sang and sprinted.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent, electronically gifted as though by nature, undertook to ensure no family was without a functioning utility phone.
What was left of was left of the Polish community plumbed; what of the Greek smashed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents hadn't quickly left the country while WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED was happening, when it comes to be accused of having stoked fearing, indeed, that the Flammen they would consume them next - opened labneh and shisha-pipe restaurants, kept their heads down, and grew depressed with idleness.
To each according to his gifts.
Having heard only ballads, Ailinn was hard to understand how the insulting words Kevern, who had just sung to her ever have been, could be.
Music was the expression of love.
"They're not really insulting," Kevern said.
Except maybe to people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anybody, but he delighted in this song.
He was saying too much, but the garden's neglect gave the illusion of safety.
No word could get beyond the soundproofing of the giant cabbage-like leaves.
Ailinn still didn't comprehend.
Why would your father have loved something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but was reluctant, in her company to put two fingers to his lips again.
She already thought he was strange.
"It struck him as funny," he said instead.
She shook her head in disbelief, blotting out Kevern's vision.
In the whole wide world but Nothing to see, but her haystack of crow-black hair.
Nothing else he wanted to see.
"If you say so," she said, unconvinced.
But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed in genuine distress.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet specifically, no.
Your ankles, maybe, a bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the silly song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too soon for that.
"Your thick ankles are the very reason I'm attracted to you," he tried instead.
I'm perverse that way.
It came out wrong.
He had meant it to be funny.
Meaning to him, often, in a mess because he, like his father, as well as the reassuring charm necessary to be funny landed, the cruelty that lurked in jokes.
Maybe his father intended to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevern, did.
Despite his kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons flushed and rose from her deckchair, knocking over the console and spilling the wine they'd been drinking.
Elderflower wine, so drink wasn't his excuse.
In her agitation she seemed to tremble, like the Palmwedel in the Sturm.
"And your thick head's the very reason I'm perversely attracted to you," she said...
Except that I'm not.
He felt sorry for her, both on account of the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that showed in her eyes in the moment of her standing up to him.
Did she think he'd strike her?
She hadn't spoken to him about life on the chill northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he didn't doubt it was in all essentials similar to here.
The same vast and eiskalte Ozean brach to find intelligent solutions, as has in recent pelvis injury, such as the Ufer.
The same befuddled men, even more thin-skinned and peevish in aftermath of WHAT HAPPENED than their smuggler and wrecker ancestors had been, roamed angrily from pub to pub, ready to raise a hand to any woman, who dared to refuse or twit them.
Thick head?
They'd show her a thick fist, if she wasn't careful!
Snog her first - the snog having become the most common expression of erotic irritation between men and women; an antidote to the bland ballads of love the console pumped out - snog her first and cuff her later.
In Kevern's view it was a unnecessary Verfeinerung, snog itself an act of thuggery.
Ailinn Solomons made a sign with her body for him to leave.
He heaved himself out of the deckchair like an old man.
She felt leaden herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
This wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him go - as at an upstairs window her companion watched him go - a man made heavy by what he'd brought on himself.
Adam leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a pang for him and for men in general, no matter that some had raised their hands to her.
A man turned from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, all the fight in him leaked away - why was that a sight she to well, when she refused to a't recall a single instance, she knew so today, of seen it?
Alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.
A score or so years before the events related above Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher employed by Ofnow, the non-statutory monitor of the Public Mood, a short paper on the continuance of low- and medium-level violence of the country where its reduction, if not its cessation, on uprooting it expected, given the money and energy, which is based in the expended prepared.
"It has been done, and much continues to be done," she wrote, "to soothe the native aggressiveness of a people who Much has been have fought a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in those twisted knarls and narrow crevices of the country, the though where spires of churches soar above the hedgerows, the sweeter breath, historically, been rarely felt.
But some qualities are proving to be ineradicable.
The higher the spire, it would seem, the lower the passions it goes on engendering.
The populace weeps to sentimental ballads, gorges on stories a, ardently in the virtues of marriage and Familienleben believe to, but not only does the pertinacious hold equally on rural communities as on our städtischen Gefüge for in the, evidence suggests the emergence of a new and vicious quarrelsomeness in the home, in the workplace, on our roads and even on our playing fields.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to overwrite," her supervisor said when he had read the whole report.
May I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I must also enquire: Are you an atheist?
"I believe I am not obliged to say," Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Again Esme protested her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Silence once more.
"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said at last, "because I have an objection to atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a prejudice-free workplace.
We are the servants of a prejudice-free society.
But certain kinds of hypersensitivity, while entirely acceptable and laudable in themselves can, may sometimes distort findings such as you have presented to me.
You are obviously yourself prejudiced against the church; and those things you call "vicious" and "brutish," others could as soon interpret as expressions of natural vigour and vitality.
To still be harping on about WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, as though it happened, if it happened, yesterday, is to sap the country of its essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around her while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head a flamingo pink LED scroll repeated the advice Ofnow, the country for the last quarter of a century or more had been.
Smile at your neighbour, cherish your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your telephone, converse, explain, listen, agree, apologise.
Talk is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I fully understand the points you are making," Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice, once she was certain her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I am saying no more than that we are not healed as effectively as we delude ourselves we are.
My concern is that, if we are Vorwarnung without womöglich us wiederfinden it was also a means to explain why we will find ourselves repeating the mistakes that, which led to WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED place.
Only this time it will not be on others that we vent our anger and mistrust.
Luther Rabinowitz made a pyramid of his fingers.
This was to suggest infinite patience.
"You go too far," he said, "in describing as" mistakes "actions which our grandparents might or might not have taken.
You go too far, as well as well, in speaking of the their "anger" and "mistrust" on "others have ausgelassen".
It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position to we that in understanding the past, as in protecting the present, do not speak of "us" and "them."
There was no "we" and there were no "others."
It was a time of disorder, that is all we know of it.
"In which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to interject, "no section of society can claim to have acquitted itself well.
I make no accusations.
Whether it was done ill, or done well, what was done was done,.
Then was then.
No more needs to be said - on this we agree.
And just as there is no blame to be apportioned, so there are no amends to be made, were amends appropriate and were there any way of making them.
But what is the past for if not to learn from it -
The past exists in order that we forget it.
If I may add one word to that -
Luther Rabinowitz collapsed his pyramid.
"I will consider your report," he said, dismissing her.
The next day, turning up as they to work, she was by a motorcyclist who had pavement in what passers-by described as a "vicious rage on the".
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho military says no coup planned; PM stays in South Africa
Lesotho military officials denied staging a coup to overthrow the government to, saying they were acting against police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country, saying the country's military had surrounded his official home and seized government buildings in the capital of Maseru.
The premier took his family to neighboring South Africa after saying he received an assassination threat.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said it was not de facto coup, but that the military was responding to a threat from "political fanatics" whom, police were attempting to arm.
"What happened this morning was that the command of the Lesotho Defense Force was acting after receiving several intelligence reports that amongst the police service, there are some elements who are actually planning to arm some of the political, party political youth fanatics who were on the verge of wreaking havoc," he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military's actions had the appearance at an overthrow.
Even if "no one has over government through the use of force claimed to have taken, by all accounts the activities of the Lesotho defense force the hallmarks of a coup d'etat," he said.
Lesotho military officials said soldiers returned to their barracks Sunday and there was calm in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing in control of the government in Thabane's absence.
Thabane said he believes he is being targeted due to his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
Tensions have been high in Lesotho since June when Thabane suspended parliament sessions due to feuding in his unity government.
He said his actions have not undermined the government, despite allegations otherwise.
Eurozone manufacturing at 13-month low
The rise in the Manufacturing growth in the eurozone slowed to in August, as well as the, according to a closely-watched survey.
The final Markit's Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dipped to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
A figure above 50 indicates expansion.
New orders dwindled and factories suffered amid rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
The will be a clear plan from Markets looking for the bank to deal with a stalled eurozone recovery, as well as the threat of deflation with inflation standing at just 0.3%.
There is speculation that ECB boss Mario Draghi could offer further indications later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone, similar to those taken by the UK and US during the financial crisis.
"Although some growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effect of rising economic and geopolitical Unsicherheiten for the Hersteller deutlicher geworden," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's biggest trade partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a real concern, as does Italy's descent from solid expansion to stagnation.
Signs that growth impetus waned in the key industrial engine of Germany, and in Spain and the Netherlands too, is also less than reassuring, "Mr Dobson said.
The slowdown in industry is the likely to add further fuel to the fire expecting additional monetary or fiscal stimulus to be implemented.
One positive note was from the Republic of Ireland, which saw its PMI grow to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that can be said for the's Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index August eurozone manufacturing purchasing managers is that it indicates that the sector is still growing."
He added: "Produzenten at the moment as the life very difficult at the moment as current heightened geopolitical tensions - particularly related to Russia / Ukraine - add uncertainty to still challenging conditions in many countries.
This heightened uncertainty has clearly hit business - especially, and consumer confidence, and it is likely causing some orders to be delayed or even cancelled, particularly big-ticket orders.
He said it was looking "ever more likely to undertake some form" that the ECB would ultimately have some form of QE, "although we suspect that it will be limited."
The Beslan survivors' decade of hell: Ten years since the horrific school siege, how the children caught up in it are still suffering
Ten years ago over 1,000 people were hostage by Chechen militants at a school in in Beslan, southern Russia
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world.
We went back to Beslan Russia to find some of the victims who cheated death in the classroom atrocity.
Exactly a decade after the appalling Beslan school siege in which 334 perished, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatic Islamic terrorists kidnapped and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the start of a new term, it seemed like the nadir of all evil.
The tragedy united east and west in revulsion, which amazingly then turned to action and hope for the future in the direst misery.
Ten years on we went back to Beslan in southern, Russia to find some of the victims who cheated death in the classroom atrocity.
We discovered amazing young people, who have defied adversity, though the memory of this terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war now scarring Ukraine - in which children like them are dying - will now stop.
The girl pictured trying to climb back inside the blitzed school gym
She was famously snapped by top Russian photographer Dmitry Beliakow fotografiert famously and by the time she only her underwear tried to climb back inside the blitzed school gym after a mine exploded.
Bewildered, Aida was desperately searching for her mother, Larissa, now 40.
Both were feared dead, but in fact they survived.
'A woman told me to run for my life but I couldn't, 'said Aida at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mum.
A soldier plucked her to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she had totally recovered but said yesterday, however,: 'Three months ago, the pain came back.
I fear I may need more surgery.
Some shrapnel pieces are still in my knee.
Her aim now is to become a dentist, to help people as she has been aided by medics.
'This tragedy changed my life but it surely did not break it, 'she said defiantly.
'It happened to me and you can't change this fact.
Once a year I always go to the gym to recall those who remained there.
My friends and I try on other days not to talk about it.
The pain is too much.
My best friend and my classmate-to-be Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were small and dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career.
I will think about a family later.
She says the siege a little always with her though the memory every year remains.
I am pleased that many people in the world still remember our troubles and we are so grateful for the help we got from people in Britain and everywhere.
When I see online the photograph of me climbing into the school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, understand about our disaster, and stop this from happening any more.
The boy who fled through a hail of bullets believing his mother to be dead
He was on his first day at (Russians start school aged 7 school) and survived the three day siege hugging his mum Tamara.
Then seven he said: 'Mummy told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand.'
After one explosion he thought she was dying.
She told him: 'Run'.
Fearing she was dead, he fled and the on his way he saw a crying toddler, grabbed the hand, and fled through a hail of bullets.
His dad Vladimir, who scooped up his son outside, said: 'Damir told me his mother had died.
He said: 'I couldn't save her' .'
In fact, Tamara had stumbled free and was in hospital with leg wounds, in turn believing her son had perished.
After their reunion she said: 'I wept with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now defunct News of the World newspaper) by then premier Tony Blair and wife wife Cherie of Titel and Barnardo's Children's Champion by and to.
'This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop recalling it, 'he said yesterday.
Still I can say that in my mind it is fading.
I remember right afterwards, I threw away all my toy guns.
But now I can play computer games with shooting and it is not a problem for me.
'I'm not scared to go back in the gym but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids I used to play with in the yard, and who never got.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember very good on my trip to London so, specially the toy shop where I was allowed to pick anything I wanted, and riding in an open top car.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine where wars cause the kind of misery he and his friends suffered.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop recalling it.
'I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors, 'said Damir, who was last week doing voluntary work at a nunnery.
I want to help so much.
I want to serve in the police one day and hope they next year me to the training academy.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: '37 kids were killed in our neighbourhood, can you imagine?
I remember terrible silence right after the siege, there were just no children to shout and run around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She vividly recalls her trip with Damir to London.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I realised then how folk on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, can show their support.
She was grateful to 'Cherie Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just say it myself that 10 years have gone but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I remember borsch soup, when Damir wanted to eat, and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he was playing with waiters in a restaurant, Damir was shooting at them from his water pistol and they ran away and played with him.
And we were just one month away from our horror then.
I was amazed that the British people were so ready to share our pain and to support us.
She said: 'I keep thinking this world not get better within these 10 years.
Now in Ukraine the war goes on, people are dying every day, and I believe many children were killed and will be killed.
They are just the same children, like ours.
I think for many people the war is a news report they listen to when they are bored or busy with something else.
I just know what those people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and it is so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very gentle and calm boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.
He is not seeking revenge for example, he is not preoccupied with this past horror.
I know that he does not like to recall it but he is very close with six classmates and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was smaller he suffered from it - I remember he used to lie down on the sofa with his face turned away from us, for hours at a time.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his guns and other army-type toys.Damir is 17 now, taller than me, nice looking, clever and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for some hours I so sure he was dead and I'd never see him again it was going to end.
When I managed to recover after the explosion and got on my feet I looked around, I saw the hell around me, when body parts were lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that there was no way my little boy could have survived in this hell.
'I remember I was shouting to him 'Damir, run, run away' but again I was so sure he had not heard me.
But he did hear, and he did run away.
So life goes on the different than other vieler for us.
Georgy Ilyin, 17
The boy whose shocking image after the siege came to define the horror of Beslan
Comfort: Beslan survivor Georgy Ilyin with his mum Fatima after the siege in 2004, while on the right is Georgy today
His bloodstained face was etched with fear as he ran for his life as Chechen terrorists gunned down his classmates.
His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarity at Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, a senior GP, had dropped him for his first day at school before rushing to take her elder son Vladimir to university.
"I have a negative impact on left two minutes before the terrorists stürmten him, so my little boy was left there alone for three days of horror, 'she recalled.
Not completely alone, we had a family of relatives there but all of them were killed.
Only my Georgy managed to survive.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is no single day when we do not recall this tragedy.
We do not feel it was long ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes from those days come to my mind all the time.
Nobody will ever forget, I promise you.
Haunting: The image of Georgy (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and has a statue (right) been immortalised in
I remember Georgy on that day so much wanted to go to school. He wanted to, he said hug his teacher.
I only got to know he was alive when I saw him TV.
And now there is even a statue to crying Georgy in San Marino.
Georgy does not like to look at this picture and it is hidden it in the bookcase in our home.
I understand, but I also think that people from all over the world thanks to this picture feel our pain.
Georgy says now: 'It's important this can never happen again.
'I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People keep investigating such tragedies and never know the truth.
Now they are investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is moving to something very bad.
"I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, no-one wants a war, so how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need dozens of years to pass in order to forget it.
It affected my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had some nightmares because of the siege but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
This is why I keep going to the gym as each 1 September approaches.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It is hard for me to go inside the gym but I must do it.
I do not feel myself a victim, this story is the part of my past now.
I will not forget it but I do not feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I finished school this year entered a medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I will learn to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was to go in the army.
I wanted to be a military man, but my health did not let me.
I wanted to fight for my country but it will not happen.
Georgy Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived despite having been trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
Miraculous: Georgy Farniyev was during the siege Füßen to of a murderous terrorists, but still managed to survive.
As the siege, he was pictured trapped inside the gym, sitting underway, at the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is truly a miracle he was not killed.
'We feel as if it was just yesterday, 'said Georgy, who wanted to train as an intelligence officer in the FSB, but was due to his gesundheitlichen Schäden from the siege.
It is still with me, this is not something I left behind.
I am older now and people use to say children easily cope with bad experience - I must say this is not true.
'In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I did feel a bit better afterwards but I can't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - the year after - was the first and the last time when I went inside the gym again.
I lost consciousness.
I would never ever go there again and please don't ask me to show where I sat in that well-known picture.
Survivor: Georgy Farniev pictured today, with a photograph of him in hospital follwoing the siege on his laptop
My pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I do not like to think or discuss it and they never asked me about the school.
In terms of physical condition I am well.
I should be careful with my knee which was injured but I walk fine now.
Still my health did not let me go and study in FSB secret service academy in St Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical papers, and they replied it was not possible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have completed two years there.
He is learning to treat all animals' from cats to cows'.
He said: 'I know I would never been able to children to of Erfahrungen report that it was going to end.
This is not something children should know about, and of course not something they should experience erleiden not.
His mother Marina, 42, said: 'This pain never leaves me.
It is in my soul, worse when the anniversary gets close.
I will go and attend ceremonies being held to mark it.
I know Georgy won't go.
It must be even stronger for him because he was there and I was not.
I was waiting for him at home, not able to help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me.Here in Beslan the imprint is on everyone.
It stays with us.
Georgy is an adult now but that horror is still with him.
It is hard to accept it when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He is a boy, he likes sports but he can't take part because of his knee.
He had several surgeries, he walks but cannot exercise.
I would say he 50% overcame this horror, but one can never completely overcome and forget it.
This horrible experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbours were killed in the siege, and it only adds to my pain.
I lost many people I knew well and they were dear for me.
My son is with me and this is the greatest gift God could do for me but my heart aches about those killed.
I know families where new children were born, but also widows who never married again.
It is hard to accept that life goes on, even if you do not want it.
I will never forget my heart jumping out of my chest at the moment I saw him in hospital.
Now I look at what is going on in the world - wars in different regions.
What are those people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be one friendly country in the past, how did it happen that we are fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure in Ukraine many children were already killed and many will be killed.
If we could only grab all the rebels and throw them away - as far away as possible.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
The baby who carried poignantly to safety by a special forces commando was
Saved: Alyona Tskaeva is carried to safety by a Russian special forces commando (left).
She is now ten (right) and has no memory at all of the atrocity
The world gasped in 2004 when baby Alyona in the arms of a Russian police officers from was carried out of the Beslan siege.
Terrorists let her go but cruelly kept her 30 year old mother, ten year old older sister Kristina, and brother Makhar in the school gym.
Makhar, then three, escaped, but Alyona's mother and sister died in the murderous carnage.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and with his new wife Svetlana he has a baby girl, after he took his daughter who were Kristina.
Alyona, now ten years, has no memory of the siege and has into a bright and happy girl, say neighbours.
'They are a big happy family now and Alyona and Makhar are both great kids, 'said a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic dad and wants to get them away from all the memories as the tenth anniversary is marked.
You can understand why.
Man accused of knocking down girl on Fife pelican crossing

Gordon Stewart is alleged to have knocked down the girl on a crossing in Pittenween in East Neuk.
Prosecutors said Mr Stewart drove his Audi Q3 without due care and attention and knocked the girl down to her injury.
Stewart, 78, from Anstruther, denied the charge at Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles Macnair QC set a trial date in January.
4 tips for better underwater photos and video
If you're interested in shooting photos or video underwater, you have a variety of equipment choices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam, such as the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, which both go for around $300.
I shot these photos at a family party using several cameras, all priced under $350.
No matter what gear you use, a few rules apply for getting the best results.
Double-check your gear.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera's battery and other compartments are tightly closed.
Coffers your camera to the type of photos or video you aufnehmen to.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene or shooting modes that will optimize the exposure for dim undersea settings.
And before you jump in, know how deep your equipment can go.
Some cameras are now only a collection of thought-provoking ideas rather than to to zugelassen 5 feet, others to 50 or 60 feet.
Check out our buying guide and Ratings for digital cameras for both conventional and waterproof models.
Take multiple shots - because many of them won't work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have LCDs to help you compose photos, while action cams generally don't.
Even if you have an LCD, it's going to hard to see it underwater, and composing your shot will be a hit-or-miss process.
So shoot multiples.
Also, if your camera has a bracket mode, which shoots a burst of shots at slightly different, take advantage of it.
Stay near the surface.
Light falls off dramatically the deeper you dive underwater.
If possible, stay close to the surface when you shoot in a pool, a lake or the ocean.
This will also allow you to capture more color in your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you'll see.
Get close to your subjects.
This is great advice for shooting on dry land, but it is even more important underwater because of the dim lighting conditions.
It's particularly important if you're shooting with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed, wide angle lens, which means you have to get closer to your subjects if you want them to fill the picture frame.
Andrew Lawson was the kind of man of personality could things character. Whose changed, even in a gargantuan organisation like the NHS.
A Anästhesiearzt widmete he his career to sparing the sick both the agonies of illness and the torments of treatment.
Among those who sought him out, his wife remembers, was an MI6 officer who had to live with the crippling after-effects of torture.
Lawson understood that while doctors captivated by diagnoses and diseases, are those being treated are overwhelmingly concerned with something else entirely: Pain.
One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
"I have not felt myself," he wrote in May that year.
I've had difficulty in energising myself.
Struggling with flu-like symptoms, he found himself impatiently berating his wife, Juliet.
"I want everything to happen sooner rather than later," he noted.
When Juliet went away on business for a week, Lawson found himself unusually, and unaccountably, upset.
Something was up.
He got a colleague to perform a chest X-ray.
Just two weeks earlier he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray came back.
He had mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or lining of the lung.
With most cancers, it is hard to know the exact cause.
Though some smokers get lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer sufferers have smoked.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost every case, the cause asbestos - a fibrous building material once again, who once dubbed "miraculous," but now known to be mortally dangerous.
For most of us, mesothelioma has been an easy disease to ignore.
Asbestos, after all, is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when a voluntary industry ban came into effect.
Even when it was used, only people in specific industries worked closely with it - pipe laggers, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
An industrial toxin from another era, it hardly seems cause for concern today.
But such complacency is misplaced.
Britain, it turns out, is today at the peak of a mesothelioma epidemic.
There are more mesothelioma deaths here than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual toll of about 2,500 double die many people in this disease as die in accidents in motor vehicles.
Mesothelioma annual deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in Great Britain
The reason that we are feeling its deadly effects now, though asbestos use has been illegal for years (all types banned by law in 1999), who is that usually takes decades for mesothelioma to develop.
And the mesothelioma scourge is not confined to veterans of industrial building jobs.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases still is, embedded in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the in, the schools we are educated in, and the stores we shop in.
As a result, mesothelioma is no respecter of class, wealth, occupation, or age.
The bastions of privilege, from smart London department stores to public schools, have proved no refuge.
The Houses of Parliament are riddled with asbestos.
Even the hospitals that are meant to make us better have been reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
Nor was he a pipe lagger.
In fact, he struggled to think where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he put his finger on it.
"It seems that there may have been in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital where I spent six years training, may have been a lot of asbestos," he wrote.
Everybody - students, nurses, doctors and porters - used the tunnels.
One wonders how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
It was a question to which, sadly, he was able to provide a partial answer.
"Of four doctors who trained at Guy's Hospital and, which is based in the past five years subsequently developed mesothelioma," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one left alive."
How many of us will get the same disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died, on February 17 this year, he was 55.
To survive so long is unusual.
Fifty per cent of mesothelioma sufferers are dead 8 months after diagnosis.
It is always fatal.
We can only echo Lawson's question: "How many of us will get the same disease?"
According to Britain's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, our best guess is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain should have some people will have died, 90,000 people.
Most currently have no idea that they will die this way.

A quick glance at the reports from the courts, where those affected often turn for compensation, shows how far the scourge of mesothelioma has spread.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted negligently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, supervising clothes sections at two sites - one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs Allen was only 18 when she started working at M & S.
Now she has two children in their 20s.
"Before this happened," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I never would have dreamed that I would be affected by it.
Few people do know much about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos describes not one substance but a group of six minerals.
They get their name from the word "asbestiform" - which describes the fibrous structure which endows them with strength and flexibility.
Of the six, in the Baugewerbe verwendet.
Chrysotile, commonly known as White Asbestos, is today the by far the most frequently found in buildings.
It was used in roofing panels, floor tiles, pipe insulation, boiler seals, even brake linings in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but that can kill by the EU and WHO considered a "major health hazard" möglicher Todesfolge angesehen.
More dangerous, however, are Brown Asbestos (amosite) and Blue Asbestos (crocidolite).
Britain was once the world's largest importer of Brown Asbestos, and experts suggest that "there is strong but indirect evidence that this was a major cause of the uniquely high mesothelioma rate [in the UK]."
A Marks & Spencer employee was exposed to asbestos at its flagship store in Oxford Street, London Alamy
Janice Allen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim, but the of work Julian Peto's that her story is far from uncommon.
He has produced a study of sufferers which suggests that "a substantial proportion of mesotheliomas with no known occupational or domestic exposure were probably caused by environmental asbestos exposure."
Much of that exposure, he says, is due to "normal occupation and weathering" of our buildings.
It seems that there may have been, one of ausgehen, when it comes to be sure.
A report from Goddard Consulting, which looked at the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the heart of government, might have been exposed unawares.
In 2009 Goddard reported that service shafts and piping ducts behind Parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibres disturbed by something as innocuous as "strong currents of air" could be.
MPs are frequently accused of looking after their own interests, but in this case it seems the opposite may have been true.
While the Parliamentary Works Services Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster had a "sauberes given", it is now accepted £1bn of work lasting several years is required to overhaul Parliament, Elektroinstallationen modernisieren to the and entfernen to asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election MPs may sit in the nearby presumed that the to think nahegelegenen in the QE2-Konferenzzentrum treffen, the riders could acquire cold drinks than on the Green Benches at Westminster.
The Goddard report noted that "the presence of asbestos has not been managed in accordance with the various regulations."
It is impossible to know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All anyone can do now is wait.
One person who has asbestos never been able to pinpoint his exposure to is Graham Abbott, a GP.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects that he while working in hospitals was exposed to asbestos.
"I have worked at a hospital where positive asbestos claims have been made," he says, "But I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places one has worked in, and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day early in December in 2009 when he was overcome with what felt like a fever.
He was 45, and in the middle of a late evening surgery.
Suddenly I started feeling shivery.
It came on very quickly.
I felt dreadful.
I didn't think I was all the way home to be able to drive.
Being a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from the pleura, the lining around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
He ended up spending a month off work.
Puzzled doctors gave him chest X-rays, and administered pleural catheters to draw off fluid from the lungs and send it for assessment.
Yet the condition went undiagnosed.
Slowly his health improved and he went back to work.
But from time to time the same symptoms returned, often after he took exercise and was breathing hard.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients arrived at his GP's surgery and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even then Abbott didn't make the connection with his own case.
After all, his patient was decades older, and had worked directly asbestos.
The link in that case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his consultant took his CT scans and X-rays to a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott started feeling unwell, a probe, equipped with a camera, was fed into the cavity between the lining of his chest and the lining of his lung.
I'm an optimist.
I tend just to plod along, "he says.
Ehrlich said, however, I hadn't worried about it too much to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worrying.
The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosed with mesothelioma
Suddenly Abbott was plunged into meetings with Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested that he should get in touch with a lawyer.
That was when he realised the scale of the epidemic.
"It turns out that asbestos was widely used, particularly in big public buildings which quite often had asbestos lagging on the pipes," he says.
People, the asbestos in those buildings, were exposed to get this disease now.
So mesothelioma is now affecting younger people not in the typical professions.
The most dangerous asbestos-lagged pipes in hospitals were below ground level, so patients are unlikely to have been affected.
But many staff, walking in pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson), or eating in basement canteens (as Graham Abbott frequently did) almost certainly did come into contact with the toxic substance.
For several decades after the war, it turns out, hospitals were potentially life-saving places for patients, but life-threatening places for the doctors who treated them.
It is still being removed today.
Pupils perched their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats
And it is not just hospitals.
Asbestos was halls for its marvellous insulating and flammhemmenden qualities frequently used in offices, shops, libraries and Stadthallen verwendet.
Schools too.
In fact many people will have been first exposed to asbestos in the classroom.
Up and down the country, in myriad chemistry lessons, pupils have perched their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.
Websites have sprung up to address the issue of asbestos in schools.
And so have Meanwhile, in our homes, items as floor tiles or Schuppendächer contained asbestos.
"It's an industrial poison built into large amounts of our housing stock," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his case against Guy's Hospital.
In one case was the only contact the woman sufferer could think of pulling down a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how you pull down the garden shed.
The impact of diagnosis, knowing that the disease is incurable, is huge.
"It takes a while to sink in," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to carry on but realised that I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I was at the surgery for two weeks.
Then I realised that I would have to leave and sort myself out.
Well, I won't see Christmas again.
One of the hardest things was moving from the position of doctor to that of patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers feeling bewildered by the amount of information to get to grips with.
"It was hard to take everything in," he says.
"I asked my consultant" How long do I have? "
I was quoted about 12 months.
I remember thinking "Well, I won't see Christmas again.
That's it. ""
Mesothelioma is particularly pernicious, because it mechanics of how we stay alive - the very act of breathing - is that causes the cancer that kills.
Most Mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibres.
When the asbestos is disturbed and the fibres are inhaled, they can become embedded in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibres irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
"The problem comes from inhaled needle-shaped fibres of asbestos," Professor Tom Treasure, a cardio-thoracic surgeon who moved in 2001 to Guy's Hospital.
The very hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading centre in treating mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson, and treated some others who are likely to have while training at the hospital exposed to asbestos.
Once the asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, says Treasure, "the act of breathing pushes them on the periphery, which is where the lining is.
It is by its nature invasive from the very beginning.
The normal options for treating other Krebserkrankungen funktionieren with mesothelioma is not as well.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, for example, is hotly debated.
Some feel it is worth trying.
Treasure disagrees.
"You can't excise the pleura," he says.
You can't get your knife round it.
Meanwhile the cancer "is not very responsive to chemotherapy," which "has an effect" but does not cure.
"Every now and again you get long survivors," says Treasure.
But in the end they all die.
Happily, some patients do live far, far beyond expectations.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.
Two-and-a-half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still battling on.
After contacting mesothelioma Abbott was put in touch with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, had become a one-man support and advice bureau for fellow sufferers.
"Hello, Cancer Central," he would announce cheerily when they called.
"He was very positive," says Abbott.
He had been diagnosed 4 years before and was still very active.
Initially, Abbott had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy take four months, and likely prolong his life by just one month that would.
"I felt desperate," he says.
I felt like giving up.
Lawson, however, "managed to things to put a slightly better tint on".
After seeing several consultants, Abbott decided to pursue his treatment with Prof Loic Lang-Lazdunski, professor in thoracic surgery at Guy's.
"We had an advantage in that I didn't have to be referred, I just rang them up and they saw me," Graham admits.
The average patient would have to get a referral and have funding approved.
Money is crucial for those with mesothelioma to pursue the best available treatments.
But when those treatments eventually, inevitably, fail, many sufferers are faced with another financial worry - about the future of the families they will leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in pursuit of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan, from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been unconscious since 1898 has been known that asbestos is noxious to health," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it was realised that even very low levels could be a risk to health.
That is where company negligence came in.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital eventually settled their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full-value settlement" since Lawson could not prove definitively that his mesothelioma to asbestos exposure at Guy's was down.
After the inquest into his death, a spokesman for Guy's did confirm, however, that "the asbestos in the health systems of affected Kellerbereich in the 1990ern away,".
That was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation - has proved a huge problem, pinning lethal asbestos exposure on one company or place of work - usually decades after the fact - has proved.
Many of their former employers have changed hands or gone out of business.
Insurance records may have been lost.
And the those defending themselves from claims know they have time on their side, which the claimants certainly do not.
In response, this year has seen major new legislation which makes it easier for those with mesothelioma to claim compensation even if their former employers can no longer be traced.
The law has created a Versicherungsindustrie by the geförderten Fonds of, for those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove exposure but have no one to sue.
In these cases sufferers will be awarded 80 per cent of what a court in a normal compensation case might have awarded - about £120,000.
About 300 successful claims to the scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many involved with mesothelioma sufferers, thinks that £350m represents "a very good job" for the insurance industry.
"It's a deal written by insurers for insurers" he says, suggesting that the sum is a quarter of, what insurers would have had to pay if the passage of time had not intervened, and mesothelioma sufferers the track down companies and sue them.
Even Mike Penning, then Works and Pensions minister, admitted that the law was "not perfect."
But both Penning and Morgan admit that, with seven victims dying each day, quick action was needed.
"People are suffering so much, and need help today," said Penning during the Mesothelioma Bill's second reading in December last year.
By then, Graham Abbott had been 19 months spent in the hands of Prof Loic Lang-Lazdunski for.
After their initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski advised surgery, for example, given punishments like, for example, in contrast to Tom Treasure, he has a positive effect.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a tri-therapy for which Lang-Lazdunski advised five year survival rates as high as of years to 40 per cent to präsentieren can.
Abbott felt empowered.
"That of course is with the Wichtigste," says Abbott.
You see it in patients all the time.
There is some drive that keeps you going.
When you give up you can deteriorate very quickly.
Graham Abbott went in for surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August he had the last of his six cycles of chemotherapy, behind.
Follow-up scans revealed no sign of the disease.
Then I had my scan in March [2014].
There was multiple spotting [of cancer] around my chest.
I was just about to turn 50.
It's not life threatening.
It's life ending.
Once again Abbott put himself through six cycles of chemotherapy.
Now there is no sign of the tumours.
But the process is both physically and emotionally gruelling.
You have to think about practical things - about the finances when I'm gone for example, or showing my wife how the boiler timer works.
When you get bad news you start getting negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that is not always easy.
"It's hard as a parent," he says.
It is hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed I told the girls that I had a condition that meant I wasn't going to become old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and boisterous.
She told her friends and we got lots of calls very quickly.
Ellie was more reserved.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients must face.
But for mesothelioma sufferers such discussions are not leavened by hope, by even a glimmer of pursuit of survival.
The disease carries with it (even as it did, eventually, for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, "mesothelioma is not life threatening.

China refuses to give Hong Kong right to choose leaders; protesters vow vengeance
China's parliament decided Sunday, despite growing agitation for democratic reform against the voters nominate candidates for the 2017 election Hong Kong Wählerschaft.
The move is likely to spark long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision by China's National People's Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to weed out any candidates not loyal to Beijing.
"It's not unexpected, but it is still infuriating," said legislator Emily Lau, chairwoman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They've lied to the people of Hong Kong.
And it's clear we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China's ruling, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Ständigen Ausschusses Committee of the National, said allowing public nominations in the election for Hong Kong's leader would be too "chaotic."
Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing had promised to allow the region's residents to vote for the chief executive beginning in 2017.
The Chinese leaders presented the Sunday ruling as a democratic breakthrough because it, as well as the Bürgern of a Hong Kong is direktes Wahlrecht, but the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders would retain a firm hold on the process through a nominating by Beijing committee tightly controlled.
And, according to a new clause, only candidates who "love the country, and love Hong Kong" would be allowed.
The ruling comes after a summer that the some of the largest and most high-profile protests in Hong Kong in years stattfanden.
Behind much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not grant authentic universal suffrage.
On Sunday night, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had assembled in the rain outside the Hong Kong government's headquarters.
At the demonstration, organizers said that their movement was entering a new stage of civil disobedience and that they in the coming weeks would mount waves of protests.
She However, they did not give details, apparently looking to problems with authorities.
In an online statement, organizers said the movement "has considered occupying Central only as the last resort, an action to be taken only if all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.
We are very sorry to say that today all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of Central will definitely happen.
Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and security was tight Sunday at the government headquarters, with police and barricades deployed.
Driving the unrest is a sense among many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control over their city.
An influx of mainlanders is fueling competition for products and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, with those rights under increasing pressure from Beijing are beginning to bend under.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying its demonstrations put business - the lifeblood of Hong Kong - at risk.
"The protest they are talking about, it could result in much economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long," said legislator Regina Ip, who has held high office over the movement has long criticized.
We don't want concern to spread that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
This is a perception that is bad for investment.
China's state-run media also has run stories in recent days painting Hong Kong's democracy activists as agents of subversion directed by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights that drew 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.
And in July, tens of thousands turned out for one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region's history.
US prom culture hits is now university life with freshers offered private jet entrances
We're excited to be answering this demand by launching the UK's first luxurious travel service for the students of today.
To the maximum impact arriving at university, the company also make offers transport options including private jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also claimed the service had a safety aspect.
The service is an ideal alternative for students who have to haul their belongings across in a dangerously overloaded car the country would usually.
Paired with our new VIF options, we're looking forward to ensuring this year students reach university with minimum fuss and maximum luxury.
A spokesman for the company said that there is no bookings yet because the service has just launched there have been only but added that "students will be the service over the next few weeks."
The company also said that despite students facing tuition fees of £9,000 a year to find a market for the service.
Students of today are quite different in terms of expectations and aspirations, as well as the compared to students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago - it's more important than ever to make a great first impression to carry on and VIF is just the.
However, the National Union of Students criticised the service as out of touch.
Megan Dunn, NUS vice president for higher education, said: "This scheme seems incredibly out of touch with the lives of the majority of students.
Many students starting university this month are facing see, facing a cost of living crisis, with available financial support in loans and grants to keep pace with spiralling bills for basic essentials, before they can even start thinking about forking out thousands of pounds for something as simple arriving at their halls of residence.
Feminists take on race and police conduct post-Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., earlier this month.
Attendees hold their hands up while chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot," as they wait in line before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo. over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in the online conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminist commenters prioritized gender above race when it came to pushing forward reproductive rights and income inequality.
But as tensions rose in the Midwest and drew nationwide coverage, Perez saw responses from white women that centered 100 percent around race.
Compared to the responses of black women soon after the shooting on August 9, the personal essays with titles like "thoughts on ferguson as a white woman" and "Feminism Is Not Just About Women's Oppression" came relatively late.
But to Perez, it demonstrated a significant shift.
"I don't think you feminism in a lot of people talking about whiteness and privilege," she said.
People felt called to voice something about what happened.
It's very emblematic of the crisis we face and because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racialized, they have to call that out.
For Ohio State University English professor Koritha Mitchell that the, Ferguson brought to light issues that black American women face every day aren't but as "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.
"I can post something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner and it will get 150 likes from all over the place," said Mitchell.
When I post something about how people of color are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How is it safe for women to speak publicly about relationships but not about safety in the public sphere?" She asked.
For black women like Mitchell who race, gender and sexuality in U.S. history have studied, there is no dichotomy between issues regarding race and gender.
To her, black women have not had the luxury of neatly separating the issues; they live the combined reality every day.
While white women are now combining issues of race and gender in mainstream feminist spheres, Angela Hattery, women and gender studies professor at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
You needed the white woman to be complicit in the narrative to justify the lynching.
To Hattery, the breakdown between white and black women the came when white suffragists like Susan B. Anthony surveyed the landscape in the late 1800s and saw that the fight for voting rights would only work for one group at a time: Women or blacks.
"They made the decision to put their eggs in and for voting rights would blacks should be come later," said Hattery.
To look back at things like that gives us a powerful perspective on why women of color don't trust white women.
We haven't done a good job.
We haven't helped black women protect their husbands and sons ever.
Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to organize against lynching as the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group came nearly 40 years after originally asked for assistance black women, said Mitchell.
To Mitchell, the upswell of white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - police conduct, racial discrimination - reflect the times white feminists have had to play "catch up" to issues black women have grappled with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have those [traditional feminist] platforms took as seriously the right to raise a child as they did their right to have birth control?" Posed Mitchell.
Second wave feminists who fighting for reproductive rights and access to birth Mitteln aufbauten are now figuring out what that means.
Noted white feminist activist Gloria Steinem took went two weeks after Michael Brown's shooting on Facebook and shooting to post a pointed column by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll that demanded more protest from white Americans on the issue of racism.
"I hope women, who have a different but parallel reason for a, the body danger understanding to - and racial opinions that are measurably different in public polls - will lead the change," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem has vouched for a more intersectional feminism that includes issues of race as well, for example, some of her comment on race in America still verblüfft.
She has launched in the American Enterprise Institute Autorin of "Who Stole Feminism?," told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks on Ferguson to are in contrast to their former criticism.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently initiated a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable black and Hispanic young men, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
Police relations with the black community is not the only issue pushing to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After U.S. border patrol apprehended nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country's southwest border this year, immigration reform surfaced once again - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women for immigration reform, said that for a Neubetrachtung of the Themas wesentliches as a women's issue she needed to do was share immigrant women's stories.
"They speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of employment visas are given to [male immigrants], the women who come with them are left in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories resonate with women's organizations," she said.

Leonidas begged in the gladiatorial arena
It was not only the gladiators that stood ankle deep in the mud at the park during Rheinbach's first Roman day.
The appeal of the event was so great that it attracted more than 1000 visitors yesterday, who braved the rain and autumn chill, and who were completely taken in by the historical show.
There was a colorful start with representations, performances, games, exhibition pieces and information on Roman times and their significance to the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial arts group from the gladiator school "Amor Mortis", which, every time it stopped raining, seized to in the soft sand covered arena their robust martial arts.
The owner of gladiators "Leonidas" proved himself to be a humorous and expert presenter, who sent men, one after one, into the ring for a heroic duel in a variety of gladiatorial genres.
At first the "provocateurs" were lined up with a rectangular shield and short sword, as well a cuisse on the left leg, and a vembrace on the right arm.
Then there were the "Essedarii" wearing a breast-plate, and carrying a short sword and a spear, as well as eisernem iron gladiator helmet, a cuisse and an arm guard.
What was particular impressive was the performance of the "Retiarius", who with a cast-net, trident and Dolch against the "Secutor", and who, after a short fight, knocked the guys to the ground.
The swords clashed against one another, the shields clanked and the spears flew, zooming through the arena, so much so that you feared for the safety of the gladiators.
However, the gigantic "Summa Rudis", a muscular referee, constantly kept a keen eye on them.
"We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life, and enable the culture of Roman times to be experienced", Lorenz Euskirchen, the chairman of the events organization "Freundeskreis Römerkanal" explained as the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the park was transformed for one day into an "Oppidum Romanum", a Roman city Vizebürgermeister how Claus Wehage in his welcome speech that after.
In the end, the Romans not only brought war and conquest to our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous buildings, which we can still admire today.
Some of Römertag in to bestaunen, such as "Aduädukt-Marmor" from the eleven-meter high, and 1400 meter long, Roman canal bridge, which is the only one in Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus-Gesellschaft, the water and Energieversorgung now and once made, and the managing director, Petra Fricke, said: "We still derive benefit today from the knowledge of back then".
This was confirmed by the surveyor Ralph Heiliger from "IngenieurteamZwei" in Rheinback, who introduced the instruments used by the Romans for surveying, such as the Chorobat, Groma and Dioptra.
The Römervilla in Blankenheim presented sketches and models of the excavations of 1894, as well as bricks made from the original hypocaust, forced-air heating, which was once used to warm up Römervilla.

In 2011 the office of archaeological monument conservation at the state association in Rheinland excavated the remains of a Roman Villa in an industrial estate in north Rheinbach.
The enclosing walls of an agricultural building were discovered and contained a kiln for drying crops and malting.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural manor, archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser explained.
A range of finds from the excavation were presented in a glass cabinet, among which were a large plate, several fine glass jars and parts of a small necklace.
Morscheiser presumed that the Villa was there from between the first and fourth century Anno Domini until the invasion of the Germanic people in the former Roman Rheinland.
The children also kept themselves busy playing the Roman windmills game, similar to today's mill game, or they wrote, as did the Roman pupils at the time, their names with metal pens on wax tablets.
At the Roman thermal bath stand from Zülpich, the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves; at the Rheinbach Glasmosaiken basteln and at the Eifel Nettersheim nature center stand, they got to use a heavy wheat mill made of stone so they could grind the flour needed for a pita bread or muesli.

Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought of shrinking bills as a Fehldiagnose over the next few years many that she was going to die.
Karin Rodgers spent most of her teenage life believing that she only had years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.
She actually had Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
Charity CMT UK said that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because so little is known about the condition.
About 23,000 people in the UK are thought to have CMT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, an awkward gait and curled toes.
Sufferers can also experience numbness or pain and the condition is incurable and progressive, meaning symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13 she was under the impression that she suffered from Friedreich's ataxia (FA) - a condition which had a very poor prognosis.
Rodgers thought that she was going to be wheelchair bound by the time she was 18 and dead before she reached her 30s.
The mother-of-two, who is now 51, said: "As a child I knew I couldn't do the same things as others.
I was falling daily and everything took me longer to do.
I could never with the other children Skateboard or Rollschuh'll go on and has at school a lot because of the what passers-by described as I walked and ran.
Rodgers said when in the she was aged 13, after several operations to release her Achilles tendons and straighten out her her feet, she took notes when her consultant left the room at that she suffered from FA.
"I felt guilty because I'd been nosy and so I didn't tell anybody, but I did come home, look up the condition at the library and wrote to the FA Association," she said.
When I got the information back I was gobsmacked and in the worst state of panic possible.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and dead by the time I was 25 and in between gradually lose all my ability.
I was going through this on my own and I planned my own funeral.
She said by the time she reached 17 she realised that her walking abilities hadn't deteriorated as much as the castle garden, she thought they would have and asked her surgeon.
He just stood up and hugged me and said 'my dear I don't think you have it, as you wärst here so now to be wheelchair. "
I think you have something a lot less life threatening.
After some genetic testing she was found to have CMT.
"When he explained what CMT was, I thought I'd drawn the lucky straw," she said.

Washington-area business owners "tax burden mounts as economy rebounds
A rebounding economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies across the country grew modestly last year as the economic recovery accelerated, according to new research released last week, and Washington-area firms were no exception.
District, Maryland and Virginia businesses collectively paid $27.6 billion to state and local coffers in fiscal 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent over the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.
Businesses "state and local tax burdens last year expanded by 4.3 percent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth in after back-to-back years of shrinking bills 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose at a faster clip, than local levies, 3.9 4.3 percent, according to the study, which was conducted by professional services firm Ernst & Young and the Center on State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the District's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from business taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from firms.
Virginia, at 28 percent, generates the least amount of tax revenue, proportionately, from business.
Much of the growth in tax revenue is being driven by a rebound companies "real estate values, researchers say, which pushed property taxes up 3.7 percent this year after three aufeinanderfolgenden Wachstumsraten with years of less than $1 percent growth.
While a large share of those gains came from big states such as California, New York and Texas, it appears to be the same story in the Washington area as well.
Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively forked over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up from $9.6 billion in 2012 - year-over-year growth of 4.2 percent.
But the apparent bounceback in property values isn't doing nearly in Maryland as much to inflate state and local tax revenues, where property taxes amount to barely more than a fifth of companies "tax bills.
Virginia and D.C. firms pay nearly half of their state and local tax bills in the form of property taxes.
"What's happening in Maryland is that so much of their property, especially the tax base surrounding the D.C. area, is owned either by the government or by nonprofits, which don't pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more heavily on, for example, its income taxes to pay for the same services you have in other states.
The recent rebound in business tax revenue to the economy rebounds of the Immobilienmarktes zugerechnet, the riders could acquire cold drinks
Business incomes also appear to be on the mend, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported state corporate income taxes of $2.3 billion, up from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland collected $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, the most in the region.
While trending in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses't growing at the same pace in all three Orten evenly take part in the banning submission.
The District's rate of growth was the national average, at 4.3 percent, while Maryland's growth was substantially faster at 4.9 percent.
Only Virginia posted a below-average tax bill bump of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the three jurisdictions the lowest corporate income tax by far in (all the three there is feste Unternehmenssteuersätze).
Maryland's corporate rate is 8.25 percent, while the District's stands at a relatively high 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia had lower state and local business taxes, the riders could acquire cold drinks demands as a and a better Steuerklima established here than Maryland.
The District wasn't evaluated in the study.
Despite the Vorteile, Virginia is bright lights during the wide range of his pressure from its neighbor to the south.
North Carolina recently signed legislation lowering its corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, in line with Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state Einkommensziele his still in the coming year, the law could this, as well as the state's Unternehmenseinkommenssteuersatz to be widened into two lanes over to vote income tax rate as low as 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, it appears that the small businesses in the Washington Washington to be better and thus paying more state and local taxes, according to the recent study.
Business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business owners - the pass-through structure by which most small firms are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia surged 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a much faster rate of growth than overall business taxes.
Researchers say that trend and the increase in business taxes nationwide are likely to continue this year, with overall sales tax revenue for state and local governments up 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year.
However, the Washington area may lag behind as the slowdown in federal spending takes its toll on the region's labor market.
Twin town: German beer for Guangzhou
Hops and malt - a popular combination even in China.
German beer is enjoying an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt's twin town in China would like a brewery, and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer brewed in Frankfurt's twin town of Guangzhou - that is the burning desire of the Chinese officials.
"We would be delighted if a German brewery would set up business in our city", the deputy party secretary of the southern Chinese city, Li Yiwei, said this week during a visit to the city by an SPD delegate.
Time and time again throughout the conversation, the official of the ruling communist party in China came back to this wish of the twelve million people metropolis.
Guangzhou, which is also known as Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China Li advertised.
So, the people also have the buying power to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who led the German delegation, said to the host that he named as Council President, were voted in Germany for a possible partner umhören, the project.
"You don't need a lot to make beer: Good water, grain and a zest for life", he added over lunch with the senior party member in Guangzhou.
This zest for like already beams out of Mr Li, he said flattering the host.
, the official from Guangzhou clicked glasses with Schäfer-Gümbel - albeit with red wine, which was served with dinner.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao has traces leading back to the German art of brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German purity law.
More business operations
A second wish of the Chinese host would be a direct flight connection between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, the deputy party leader, Li, said.
Lufthansa used to offer such a flight, but canceled it for economic reasons in 2012.
"It would be worth it again", the local politician seemed convinced.
"The business operations between our two cities are continuing to grow".
At present, travelers would have to take a detour via Changsha in the province of Hunan, Li complained.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital city is Guangzhou, is also hoping for a flight connection.
The deputy governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, emphasized this wish during his talks with the social democrat.
"That is a very good idea", Schäfer-Gümbel answered - the Chinese deputy minister, Li Jinjun, an intimate expert on Germany, nodded in agreement.
Well-cultivated partnership
The affable deputy party leader of Guangzhou hopes to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei has already been to the Main, but not in the capacity of his role.
He only took up office this year after his predecessor was removed from office over corruption allegations.
Even the party leader of the region, Wan Qinglian, had to leave.
The action taken against the officials from Guangzhou is part of the nationwide campaign against corruption in parties and the administration, which was rigorously implemented by the head of state, Xi Jinping.
The new senior politician, Li Yiwei, Before his career in politics, worked for an American company, which is highly unusual in the Chinese communist party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he was working as a senior official in Fujian, where car manufacturer VW has built a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially adopted more than a dozen twin cities.
Of the twin cities located some 9000 kilometers away, is Guangzhou, after and cherished by both sides; for example, with a school exchange.
Last year marked the 25 year of German-Chinese relations.
The South China metropolis, which lies on the Pearl River, is almost as strong as the whole of Hessen thanks to its economic power.
Next year they would like a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, according to, Li reported.

Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what the Information reported Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a hundred other things - is buying video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be bought, but because YouTube was widely expected to be the buyer.
Three months ago, looked all wrapped up, the sale of Twitch to Google's video service for a cool billion, and the pairing seemed natural.
Twitch, the only three years ago as Justin.tv, which was founded and described as was set out to be a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead it quickly became a platform for gamers to broadcast their, Bravourstücke games in feats; a "YouTube for live gaming," in Business Insider's words.
Twitch's interface.
And "let's play," a genre of videos in which wiseacres give (mostly older) games the Mystery Science Theater treatment, are already popular on YouTube.
The point is, YouTube were a lot when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube was Twitch was greeted with a yawn comes up a lot, tech company buying out a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube fell through, considering it was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have at the moment is this statement from Twitch CEO Emmett Shear: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us get, there faster."
Another mystery, frankly, is Twitch's incredible success.
To snobs like me who declare that they'd rather play sports than watch them, it's hard to see the appeal of watching games rather than taking up a controller myself.
It's one thing to look over your friend's shoulder at 3 in the morning another to watch some as she creeps through Resident Evil, and quite a rando get 20 headshots in row in Call of Duty.
All the games you could be watching right now.
Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are first-person, so watching footage of them, without controlling the viewpoint yourself, can be a Do It Right-worthy recipe for a headache.
I concede that speedruns, in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time, are entertaining.
But unless someone is a virtuoso at gaming or humour, his Twitch channel isn't likely to be all that interesting.
But what do sceptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors monthly and is the fourth-largest source of peak internet traffic.
And, will Amazon capitalise on this?
It's hard to imagine Twitch being folded into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have just swallowed Twitch.
But Twitch has something any company would love to attract: Hordes of young men, as the Werbekunden umworben.
As Twitch chief Shear said, Amazon and Twitch "are both believers in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no sign of a Schrumpfung, even - gulp - as a sport.
There are 101 celebrity names on the bouncy castle at the Burggartenfest (castle garden festival).
The organizers' idea was right.
Despite the heavy Regengusses Samstagabend, who was born in Munich on schätzungsweise 1200 Musikfans Open-Air-Fest for in the castle garden.
Admission had to be stopped on occasion.

From two Spanish words Sachraj and Ron Sem coined the name "Armula" from.
Since the open air castle garden in Salzwedel was supposed to beam out bright lights during the day and evening shows diverse out bright lights during the wide range Shows ausstrahlen.
Well, you make your own fun anyway.
This was already apparent early on Saturday when the first visitors set off for the open air.
A festival fit for all generations organizers promised.
And that is what they delivered.
Around the supplies stand located in the meadows of the castle garden, people from Salzwedel, but also guests from near and far, made themselves at home.
They followed the first live performance, tapped their with the feet in time, and. In short: Pure relaxation and enjoyment.
And that goes for all generations.
Whilst some people sprawled out on blankets placed on top of the white sand around the beach bar, which had been carted in especially, others indulged in a glass of wine in the wine store, and the kids went crazy on the bouncy castle, which was a huge attraction for the little guests.
However, even the children's face painting kept the volunteers' in the strictest meaning of the word 'hands full children rushed to become men, and conjure up fanciful creations on the on their small faces.
The more grown up ones played on the football table or took part in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot-Crew from Salzwedel had organized.
And then the rain came.
Shortly before 5: 30 PM the rain pelted down onto the visitors; families did a runner in search of somewhere dry and.
Despite this, the festival's attractions did not get called off.
"More people than expected came", Rom Sem said, who called the event a "success all round".
As such, them from repeating the big party next year, nothing is going to stop them.
Even though more has to the size and content of the event, when it comes to be done in terms of the first balance sheet done on Sunday made a lot of the Volksstimme.
He said that one annoying thing was that, when it comes to stop allowing entry into the event temporarily.
Apparently been booked with the security company not enough security guards had.
The consequence: Some people who had already paid could no longer get into the grounds.
Feedback has been very good.
In a preliminary and cautious estimation, the Salzwedel co-organizer estimated that around 1200 visitors attended the castle garden.
There were problems with the sound engineering.
The hip Hip-Hop-Band Blocks`n`Rox brach their performance somewhat unnerved by these problems.
The engineers could not get a half-decent sound out of it.
The geplanten Shisha-Lounges could not be built because the tents could be delivered to Salzwedel due to a Reifenpanne could not be delivered to Salzwedel after could be taken.
"In next year they will be however,", according to the organizers.
The premier of the Amula-Open-Airs was in terms of the number of more than they delivered.
And that was with bad weather.
Nevertheless, the organizers have made some mistakes, which excused as it was their first time, but which have to be avoided next time round.
The social networking site Facebook organizers also had to accept criticism on.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros, I really expected more", Melanie Meier commented on the event's page.
"Unfortunately, you bit off more than you could chew", according to Ele Zimmermann on the same page.
For others, the teething problems were not such a big issue.
I think it is really good that some people are not just standing around talking rubbish, but are actually making a real effort to get something up and running.
Hats off! ", Stephanie Jenß wrote about Amula.
Now the organizers have a year's time to address these criticisms.

Will the Burgvereine (castle clubs) get back together again?
Recently there have been a lot of disputes between both of the castle groups in Wolfratshausen.
The boardroom is now contemplating the possibility of working together.
As an example for the reconstruction of the castle in Wolfratshausen, the deceased Richard Dimbath, the former chairmen of Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde (Wolfratshausen castle friends), led the project in the French Guédelon.
Up until a year ago, there was a good atmosphere among the castle club and the castle friends group in Wolfratshausen.
Their points of view are now markedly different with regard to how the history of Wolfratshausen castle and the possible reconstruction of it should be handled.
Now the two are coming together: There should soon be talks about a joint venture.
Both members of the board, confirmed Torsten Sjöberg (castle club) and Herbert Piffl (castle friends), in answer to our newspaper's query.
"I have rung Mr Piffl and suggested that we get together", Sjöberg reported.
In his opinion, all members of each club could come together again in the future.
This would enable quicker and more visible success to be achieved.
Whereas the castle friends, and the recently deceased Richard Dimbath right up until the bitter end to their eyes on reconstructing the castle mountain forest, the castle club, with Sjöberg, want to the "develop and bring the" Geländes vorderster to Stelle.
Herbert Piffl, the deputy chairman of castle friends, decided to set up to own after over the very Anruf gefreut.
He has been presiding over castle friends since the death of Dimbath.
A new chairperson will mid September during a members' meeting will be found.
At the moment, the club according to the 74-Jährigen around 40 members of.
"After the death of my friend, Richard Dimbath, we adjourned the club from's activities initially out of respect". This "Denkphase" has been necessary to "think about how it can proceed".
According to Piffl, the new chairperson will then enter into discussions with the castle club.
Until then, the castle friends can get on with the current atmospheric picture within their group.
He candidates for the there is the moment, they still do not Piffl said.
"However, I am confident that we will find someone". He himself does not want to stand for it because he lives in Bad Tölz.
The new chairperson should be in Wolfratshausen.
The man from Tölz would take part in the project "like to continue working with them".
The different points of view subject of reconstruction will when it comes to questions about technology in the Piffls presumed that the time in nächster bestehen for him.
He acknowledges Dimbath as a "missionary", who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar projects, which are well under way in Austria and France, show that this idea is no easy task.
But with a high number of participants among the population, as well as some volunteers from all over the world, it will become a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "Even I was skeptical at first.
However, with time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to press ahead with the project ". It could create a" unique characteristic "for the city of raftsmen.
Otherwise, there is nothing here.
, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"The idea of reconstruction is, therefore, something that I personally do not want to simply abandon. He hopes that the castle club will move towards this idea somewhat.
Their aim to first of all document the history "is important and good".
Then, we will see.
Smart ways to save on college textbooks
With the cost of college for many students textbooks surpassing $1,000 a year, soon-to-be sophomore Matt Schroeder came up with a smart way to trim costs.
He worked out a system of borrowing books from upperclassmen, offering nominal compensation to get them to delay selling them back.
"My calculus book that usually costs $180, I got for the semester for $10 and a Chick-fil-A biscuit," says Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
Required texts for his last semester would have cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
The College Board says the average student will spend more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and school supplies, but students have a variety of options for managing these costs.
Online outlets and creative approaches like Schroeder's are increasingly the go-to choices for students.
Renting textbooks is on the rise, allowing students to use a book for the semester, often to a significant at than Kauf.
Neebo Inc, which operates more than 250 campus bookstores, says textbook rentals have doubled since 2011.

The book was selling for $48 new.
Academics like Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst's College Without Walls, suggest students check with their professors to see if previous editions are acceptable.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the classwork.

Getting e-books instead of traditional texts is another option.
Sometimes those books are essentially rented by providing the electronic license for a specific period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg will rent "Calculus" for six months for about $61.
Bracey says students in literature classes can often find the best bargains since many classics are now available to download for free, while science and engineering texts can be extremely expensive.
No matter what, shop around.

"I thought I'd build up all of the frustration from Thursday, and smashed it into the top of the net", the 26-year old said smiling.
That Schrammel 13th of November 2010 was, until now, the last time had scored in a team from the Bundesliga, and that was with Ried.
The first championships goal at Rapid-Dress will, therefore, always be a special memory for him.
"That is something quite special for me, I am Rapid offspring", Schrammel said.
Due to Mario Pavelic's recent, Schrammel moved from playing left back to right back, where he also serve did a very good job.
He had enough experience to be able to the that he also position spiegelverkehrt ausüben can.
He deserved the goal has already achieved some assists this year ", Barisic stated.
The team shows character. Schrammel also crossed the ball over 2: 0 bright lights during the wide range of Hofmann after the first hour, which led to the decisive to the decision.
But before that, even the fans could have kept the score.
"Thank God we had some luck today", Schrammel noted, alluding to the gap between the efforts made and results achieved in the past weeks: "The results were not justified, but the games were always better when compared to last year".
Barisic even decided that "in other games better than before today", and against "the strongest team to play in the stadium this season this had played,".
These are the first three points since 26th July, and therefore prove that the structure of the team is intact despite the setbacks: "Today, my team has shown that they have character".
For him, what is just as pleasing is: "The fact that we finally played to a clean sheet again,".
A lot of work was done during the internal football break. The, as well as the fact that of Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger unfortunate circumstances that led to the absence and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl, is what makes this success all the more valuable.
"We must not forget that", Barisic said, who has lost players in the last three days, including Behrendt and Pavelic, "who recently were very stable".

It was high time ", Hofmann said.

We haven in recent weeks't been playing as badly, such as it has been made out to be.
However, we mustn't think that all is now well.
His importance to the team is something that he could not deny.
After all, it is a very young team, which, I am able to help at the moment.
They hold on to me in certain phases ", Hofmann said.
Grödig's coach, Michael Baur and his team have little to blame themselves for.
He is sorry about the quick counter goal, describing it as "a kind of magic goal", as well as the normal goal scored by Nutz in the 40th minute, which was wrongfully denied by the referee, Kollegger.
The only criticism I can make about the team is that we were sometimes not precise enough upfield.
Because we had far to few goals.
Center back, Maximilian Karner thought the same: "It started off badly, but we then found our feet, and even scored a goal.
All in all, we could have had more.

A rocky footpath leads up to the somewhat 600 year old oak tree.
You walk past enclosures, basalt cairns and a sea of stones.
The tree is located just below the Bauersberg's stone quarry, one kilometer north of the street to Weisbach.
The natural monument looks energetic; it towers above the other trees in the area, and, being more than eight meters in size of an American giant Sequoia.
A small Buddha on top of a tree stub indicates that this is a spiritual or mystic place.
Despite intensive research, there are only clues to the origins of the name.
Dr Wolfgang Schneider has once again, consulted the Bischofsheim Archives, and asked elderly people from Unterweissenbrunn in order to find out what, it has to do with the Geissruheiche.
The results of his investigation revealed a less colorful explanation of the name.
According to his research, up to around 80 years ago, the goat herders are said to have led their animals out of Unterweissenbrunn along the arduous, cleared and stoneless meadows.
The herdsmen, exhausted after the ascent, rested at the foot of the tree.
Since then, the area has won back its significance, because the herds of goats, once again Ziegenherden.
The declared the core area in the biosphere explained addition, Schneider also discovered that the only stir up more doubts in the herausgefunden.
One should exercise caution when treading over the mass of stone because the sun-warmed basalt is also a popular whereabouts for the European viper.
A hiking trail leads from Unterweissenbrunn up to the tree, but it is somewhat hidden.
Further trails are signposted, which lead up towards Hochrhön and offer an extensive hike.
Where is the moated castle?
A moated castle, which we looked for as part of our next challenge, is, of course, rather hard to find way.

The decision makes it almost impossible for opposition democrats to get on the ballot prompted pro-democracy activists to renew their vow to a halt with "Occupy Central" protests bring Hong Kong's financial hub to.
Political reform has been a major source of tension in Hong Kong, with China party leaders fearful of calls for democracy spreading to other cities.

Putin demands Kiev open 'statehood' talks with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded cease battling on Sunday that the Ukrainian government against the separatists in the country's east and immediately begin negotiations on "statehood," according to the breakaway region aufnimmt.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin didn't mean to the under separatist control of the separatists stehende territory in the eastern part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine had to be revised to give the Russian-speaking region the power to protect its rights and interests.
But Putin's call upon the Kiev government to negotiate with the pro-Russia insurgents as equals with the apparent strategy he has since the violence began five months ago he has followed since: Help the separatists take territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region virtual independence for a Allianz with Russia instead of the ermöglichen to Westen.
In an interview with state-run Channel One television, Putin denounced the Ukrainian military campaign to recover separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions that were seized in March and April, after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have lately branded the seized territory "Novorossiya," or "New Russia," a term that harkens to pre-revolutionary glory days of the Russian empire.
Putin said that anyone who believed in the offing as Ukrainian politicians launch campaigns for an Oct. 26 parliamentary election and while government troops are attacking civilian communities in separatist-held regions is on peace talks are in her "Illusionen," Itar-Tass reported.
"We must immediately commence substantive talks and not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the statehood status of southeast Ukraine in order to serve the interests of people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin's reference to statehood was meant in the context of the broader autonomy that discussed for months with the Kiev leadership has been is due to in the Russian-speaking areas zerstreuen to that their cultural and linguistic rights are in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
It's not a matter to be negotiated between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it was not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The Kremlin spokesman's intercession to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored the Russian leadership's approach to dealing with the separatist rebellion in the direkten Annektion of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million population is ethnic Russian.
Moscow would have a much the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine more difficult fight to annex even, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian and pre-conflict polls showed broad support for staying within Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would grant regional governments in Ukraine the authority to determine their own trade agreements and foreign relations to, effectively handing the Kremlin de facto control over territory that would link the Russian mainland with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula annexed five months ago is home to Russia's main naval fleet as well as commercial maritime facilities and historic coastal resorts.
The regions between Russia's Rostov area and Crimea are also home to mines, factories and foundries that produce vital components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inauguration speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers - after new elections -- weigh constitutional amendments to give more control to the disparate regions over their finances and the status of languages.
But his vision of autonomy appears to differ sharply from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels Moscow is accused of arming and instigating.
Putin's latest call on Kiev to deal with the separatist leaders as equals followed new advances by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered friedliche from a previously peaceful area in the region run Sea of the eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful protest movement led by political opponent eingedrungen.
The Russian-backed separatists took, according to the Ukrainian is Sicherheitsbeamter step first of a campaign to seize the strategic coastal territory all the way to Crimea control of the town of Novoazovsk in.
That has spurred a massive civilian and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a Stahlindustriehafen with 500.000 Einwohnern into the, between Novoazovsk and the narrow Zugang to Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko on Saturday addressed a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, when it comes to urge action to a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are of close to the point," Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit took no definitive action; the leaders called for drafting more punishing sanctions on Russia, the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainekrise signed into to The.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaysk after two columns of Russian armor and 1,000 troops last week moved into the Donetsk region to bolster the beleaguered separatists, Col. Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of a reported 63 Ukrainian soldiers who trapped in Ilovaysk by the Russian incursion were were swapped Sunday for 10 Russian paratroopers captured inside Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said Sunday.

Cyclists, joggers and walkers took part yesterday in 8th Cycling Event on the Grosser Feldberg mountain, giving their support to the 'Help for Children with Cancer'.
The way a hard grind was Tortur for some, while others treated it as a light training session.
However, everyone agreed on one thing: It was a lot of fun.
Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.
For the very first time in his life the head of the Oberursel Brewery took his bike up the Feldberg.
And for a good cause.
The on Muskelkater as he is an easy wegstecken, participation in the 8th Cycling Event on the Grosser Felberg was in aid of the 'Help for children with cancer' association, and gave him a valuable personal insight.
A great thing.
"I now know that I can do it - brilliant!"
A little break to milk the applause?
No, if I'd stopped, I'd never have been able to carry on...
Like Thomas Studanski, a for the CDU in the Oberursel town council, many a member of the 718 participants struggled in the early mountain dew, coming close to exhaustion, but arriving happily on top of the summit plateau.
On the other hand, some others found it much easier to complete the full eleven kilometre route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Diessner, for example.
The Green Politician, wearing all red, from the municipal council - red clothes, red bike - looked almost like a to be taking it gently ("Quit some professionals here, so it's all the about finishing!") - proved himself to beam out bright lights during the wide but then Berg halber as a Profi and 45 minutes later without pausing for breath.
Did come along and try out one who a go, as did Nina Kuhn, press spokesperson for the Oberursel Council, who have clashed with security security services, armed with Frank Grüneisen on the Weg at an overthrow.
For both the triathletes the "Feldberg Cycling Event" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This one is about charity, and that's why we're glad to be here - we'd have gone out riding anyway today," Kuhn said.
Along the route they met up with Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had driven down to back in to go back up to Oberusel.
Florian Zierz from Frankfurt got himself into the saddle at 9 am; he "did" the Feldberg twice, before then wheeling back home.
Another one who enjoyed himself was "Fritten-Toni".
For the manager of the Oberursel Kultkiosks gehören Radtouren over the Feldberg is perfectly natural.
He had been sitting holding hands with his 6,5-Kilo-Rennrad angepeilt 40 minutes.
A mad event.
For this cause I'm very glad to be here, "commented Andreas Balzke.
The well-conditioned man from Mainz said he was an "ambitious racing cyclist."
And he must be, since he was riding a "Fixie-Bike" which is a bike without gears...
But it wasn't only cyclists who jaunted to the top - as was evidenced not only by the 20 walkers, who climbed up via the White Wall and the Fuchstanz, but also by a jogger who pulled behind him a tyre with weights attached to him by a rope.
Mountain Rescue doctor, Professor Volker Lischke, who was there with his team was equipped with a four-wheel Bully and Quad to provide safety, and drew, said: "I know him from Frankfurt, he trains for a specialist sleigh trail - it's just that he pulls the sleigh himself." The man is, therefore, in a sense his own sleigh dog.
The 718 participants - and the greatest number ever - were sent off up the course in groups in the morning which made.
The walkers started at 9.30 am.
Then it was the turn of the cyclists and runners, who began at 10 am.
Five minutes later the first Mountain-bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, Chairman of the Association 'Cycling Event on the Grosser Feldberg' gave the starting orders and wished those taking part an enjoyable trip.
Next year, he hopes to on the course for those taking part on the to have safety barriers participants of the Feldberg.
