<seg id="1">Recalling a very American ideal that labor rights are human rights</seg>
<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have offered the bill, according to which the organization is protected by unions as a civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Where unions, jobs and the middle class," says Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, who is a co-chair of the Congress of Progressive factions.</seg>
<seg id="4">That is why I am proud to represent the Act of expanding the rights of workers, together with the symbol of the movement for civil rights by John Lewis.</seg>
<seg id="5">This innovative bill will give workers the same opportunities for legal discrimination against trade union organization, and other forms of discrimination, opponents of trade union power</seg>
<seg id="6">Changing the law on regulation of labour relations in such a way as to allow the workers encountering discrimination for participation in trade union organizations, to seek justice in the civil courts - and receive compensation and punitive damages payments - a sensible and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it's certainly not radical initiative - at least by American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the best way to understand the fact that offer Ellison, Lewis and co-authors of the bill, "recall is a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the attacks, which the unions have in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country, Americans once supported countries all over the world to adopt, to expand and to respect human rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country simultaneously defend democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas MacArthur and his assistants have helped the country to adopt a constitution, so as to ensure that my военизированная Хидеки Тодзё was replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included text that explicitly admitted that "the right of workers to organize and to negotiate, and the collective action is guaranteed."</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Эйзенхауер and his assistants have helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that fascism was replaced by Adolf Hitler a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recognizing that workers will need to be organized and be heard in the new state, Germans have included an article that openly stated: "The right to form associations in order to protect and improve employment and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict or seek to diminish that right, will have no legal force; measures to this end, may be declared illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">When former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which amounted to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, will be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and included stating that "everyone has the right to organize and join unions to protect their interests."</seg>
<seg id="17">Generations of Americans take for granted our basic position that labor rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country advised by other countries about how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans have explained that the right to organize labor unions - and the fact that this union has participated as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - should be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now, when these rights are under assault in America, wisely, actually, to go back to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to ensure that their voices were heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:</seg>
<seg id="21">History is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now everyone knows that the trade union movement is not undermined the nation's power, but increased them.</seg>
<seg id="23">Raising the living standards of millions, unions miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to fragile level of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack on unions, forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.</seg>
<seg id="25">History remembers as a must and to us.</seg>
<seg id="26">The official recognition of labour rights as human rights - and the protection of civil rights, to prevent discrimination against organizations, trade unions, was long overdue.</seg>
<seg id="27">Keith Ellison and John Lewis will visit the ideals that historically expanded America and made a promise of democracy a reality.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the U.S., a federal judge on Sunday temporarily has blocked the introduction of the Louisiana law, which his supporters say he is likely to close all five абортных clinics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to this measure, which was signed by the Governor of Louisiana Bobby Джинадлом in June and was supposed to go into effect on 1 September, doctors who do abortions, were obliged to have powers of patients in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nevertheless, the judge's decision means that, at the moment, doctors can continue to make legal abortion, while continuing to look for such authority.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally, continuing actions to gain power," he wrote in his decision, Judge John деГрэвеллз.</seg>
<seg id="6">The hearing will be scheduled within the next month, at which a judge will take a more permanent solution on this law.</seg>
<seg id="7">Abortion rights advocates met with joy at the decision, the latest in a chain of decisions against similar measures, saying it will give doctors more time to receive hospital authority.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today's decision ensures that the women will be protected from the United Louisiana law, which seeks to deprive their health and human rights," said Nancy Нортап, president and head of the Center for reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the state's five clinics.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the decision applies to doctors from two clinics, which are not played claimants in the case, and also filed an application for the authority.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, and the courts have recently acknowledged such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="11">Key parts of texas law that would have closed most of the remaining clinics in this state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fighters for the right to abortion, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association say that the laws about the credentials of doctors to impose restrictions that are not necessary from the medical point of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Abortion opponents object that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, though some also noted their positive effects in the closure of clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only one doctor who does abortions in Louisiana, there are powers for the hospital, told the Center for reproductive Rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all the other doctors in the state will be forced to stop performing the procedure, the doctor, fearing for their safety, would no longer perform this procedure, the group said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they would punish doctors doing abortions as long as their statements are waiting for the decision of the authority.</seg>

<seg id="1">What will the introduction of quotas for domestic products</seg>
<seg id="2">Not less than half of products for each type of product in the range trading networks should be the Russian production, says Duma deputy from the Just Russia faction Oleg Nilov.</seg>
<seg id="3">The MP has prepared a bill aimed at the introduction of protective measures in respect of domestic manufacturers, according to the newspaper Izvestia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The document will still детализироваться, in order to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.</seg>
<seg id="5">This applies to goods that are produced in Russia. <... > According to the rest of the groups of products, which are produced in Russia, would provide the at least half of the production of their domestic producers, "Nilov told the publication.</seg>
<seg id="6">Together with the amendments, in the article "On the basis of state regulation of trading activities in the Russian Federation," the bill provides for the introduction of changes to the Tax Code, laying down a 10 per cent rate of VAT in Norway with the implementation of the products produced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea to introduce a 50% quota -процентную in trade networks included in the stimulus package for Russian producers.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the shelves there will be several times more than domestic goods.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the initiative may have both positive and negative effects, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to the lawyer the company "Налоговик", a member of the independent centre of expertise "Public" Duma Sergei Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive in nature, and will lead to growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">The key will be, farmers, small shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">They will be able to sell more, and it means that profits will grow.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms to retailers and prices, because they will be forced to buy their goods.</seg>
<seg id="14">Russian manufacturers will be able to increase the volume of its sales activities and that will lead to pay higher taxes than before.</seg>
<seg id="15">This will increase budget revenues, will create new jobs, industries will grow any faster осваиваться, will be introduced to contribute to the growth of GDP.</seg>
<seg id="16">Russia's dependence on foreign food to fall a few times, but not immediately, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="17">Earlier, Russian companies are often unable to break into the shelves of local stores due to higher competition from foreign rivals.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche liberated and you can breathe a sigh of relief.</seg>
<seg id="19">But do not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary inspections to the Russian market will receive food from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="20">In other words, it is now a "moment of calm" when former players have already left, and the new has not yet come.</seg>
<seg id="21">Almost a month later, we can talk about the modern demand for Russian raw materials, as well as rising prices for finished products, "said Vice President АиФ.ru first all-Russian social organization" Russian club financial directors, Tamara Kasyanov.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clearly, the idea of selling in each category at least 50% of the Russian food products will allow us to consolidate the sector for local producers.</seg>
<seg id="23">In that case, they will have to compete with one another, not with products that subsidies at the expense of another state, are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="24">In other words, the fight for customers will unfold between companies in the industry. ”</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, says Kasyanov, Russian producers are able to meet 50% of domestic needs compatriots not on all items.</seg>
<seg id="26">And in this situation, the commercial networks have to "share" дотягивать Russian goods up to half of the range.</seg>
<seg id="27">In this regard, increasing fears that the shelves are substandard goods.</seg>
<seg id="28">Perhaps under the guise of produced in Russia will be supplied with labels перебитыми foreign products, "adds an expert.</seg>
<seg id="29">The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will feel the large retail chains, especially those that выгодней cooperate with importers.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is logical that the prime minister will suffer and foreign suppliers, because the demand for their products.</seg>
<seg id="31">Litvinenko did not rule out that the law on quotas on domestic goods may impact on consumers.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fact is that some of the Russian-made products can yield quality imported ones, while shops will be boosting prices on the second as a scarce commodity.</seg>
<seg id="33">The revolutions in the early 2000s, but the idea of artists started talking again in February this year because of the ongoing devaluation of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="34">Now, against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the issue of the import of products becomes even more urgent.</seg>
<seg id="35">The law aims to compel retailers to suppliers on orders from domestic producers.</seg>
<seg id="36">Then we are much faster and more confident on the way we import substitution and the planning system needed for the production of products in a shorter period of time, "says MP Oleg Nilov.</seg>
<seg id="37">Especially effective mechanism be quotas for those agricultural sectors, where the potential is particularly high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.</seg>
<seg id="38">Our farmers are able to fully cover the shelves in Russian shops.</seg>

<seg id="1">Inflation out of the vacation.</seg>
<seg id="2">Whether Russians feel a sharp increase in prices</seg>
<seg id="3">As a result of Western sanctions and the November inflation in Russia but not in forecasts уложится, analysts believe, "VTB Capital."</seg>
<seg id="4">According to experts, the deferred effects антисанкций will lead to inflationary ever in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the latest forecast, inflation in 2014 will be 6,5-7,5% the following year - less than the 6.5 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to the newspaper, "Kommersant," the commentary this week should make a "small but significant" changes in macroeconomic forecast up to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the publication, the Office may lower estimate of inflation in 2015, which will eliminate progeSOFT expected revenue growth of the population.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the forecast, it was assumed that the food sanctions apply a year - until August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">In such a situation, you could assume such high inflation?</seg>
<seg id="10">The current situation is especially geared but понижательный trend of inflation does not change, "a source told the newspaper so far.</seg>
<seg id="11">Economists from the VTB Capital "don't share expectations regarding inflation and government economic bloc forecast price growth in 2014 at the level of 8%.</seg>
<seg id="12">The main effect of product bans will come together with the possible introduction of a tax on sales in the regions of the Russian Federation (GAP) in 2015, experts believe.</seg>
<seg id="13">Inflationary spike in 9% in February, after which the annual pace of price growth will go into decline, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="14">By the way, last week concluded Rosstat first inflation results, after Russia introduced a "nice sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="15">АиФ.ru interviewed experts and found their inflationary expectations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Artem Деев, head of research at FC AForex:</seg>
<seg id="17">Prices have already observed in key segments.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moreover, when I began to appreciate the socially relevant products, the government has been forced to launch measures to monitor systemic risks to price stability, in order to prevent unreasonable price increases in the short term.</seg>
<seg id="19">Suppliers and retailers already report on a daily basis before regulators that authorities knew exactly who, where and for what reason will trigger an increase in prices.</seg>
<seg id="20">The key consumer price index growth continues to be tremendous pace of capital flight, excessive refinancing the banking sector from the Russian мегарегулятора, internal convert due to escape in foreign currency, as well as an embargo on the import of food products from the countries that joined the sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="21">If inflationary pressures remained under control, the cost of a minimum basket of food has jumped by 12 per cent in just one quarter.</seg>
<seg id="22">A ban on the import of food products provoked shock proposals on the internal market and leads to a final value enhancing логичному.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because at this stage we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, and increase the size of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production, sanctions will continue to bear the risks that growth of the inflationary component.</seg>
<seg id="24">If you include another and fiscal reasons related to the lack of trust in the national currency, as well as ухудшенными prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year, inflation could exceed 8%.</seg>
<seg id="25">Alexander Разуваев, director of the analytical department "Альпари"</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 1990s, inflation sometimes hit 20-30% per month to zero, it was also higher than the current level, another thing that then it is offset by rapid economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="27">I think, at the end of the year inflation will be 8-8,5%.</seg>
<seg id="28">Plato Магута, managing assets of the Criminal Code, "the" Магута</seg>
<seg id="29">An external factor associated with sanctions against Russia, while successfully contained, but if there is a further increase of the pressure, first and foremost, for the financial sector - this can lead to a certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations, which are traditionally cash purchases in foreign currency to protect their savings.</seg>
<seg id="30">It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance will try to smooth the weakening of the ruble, as market practices and government regulation.</seg>
<seg id="31">But prices traditionally begins after the summer lull, and perhaps this fall will become more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="32">The target level of consumer inflation in Russia at 7.5 percent, is likely to withstand, as Russia has another financial savings.</seg>

<seg id="14">"RSL" told the head of a construction company, "Anatoly Профи-инвест Демьянко estimated standards out of date for a long time, but the mechanism has not offered to other businesses.</seg>
<seg id="15">"As for the constructive elements of the proposed settlement, in practice this is implementable, because the building has often used different technologies," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is no secret that develops стройрынок thanks largely to госзаказу.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the Chairman of the Board of Community procurement professionals Экспертное "NP" Catherine Лезиной, today, the state is the most effective customer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Deputy director of the engineering industry ’ s capital construction Vladimir Malakhov drew attention to the fact that the market can be divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and the companies that hold monopolies competence and does not allow for this field of competitors.</seg>
<seg id="19">He believes that the creation of a transparent market is only possible when access to contracts that Turkey is ready to be the maximum impact from someone's manager.</seg>
<seg id="20">Experts on the council was asked to form a government in such a way that one and the same performer may not receive more than one contract worth more than $1 billion rubles, or several contracts worth more than $1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="21">In минстрое believe that this approach must be evaluated from the point of view of the business impact, and effectiveness of management.</seg>
<seg id="22">As explained by Elena Zhukov, in this case, you will need to endow customer functions, which will lead to an increase of the budget and spending on its content.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the same time, the customer will need to have the knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by contractors, as well as their safety.</seg>
<seg id="24">Often with such fines, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the security of an object as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of highly skilled members of the state in connection with the new leadership in obtaining public order for part-time work and a small amount of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="26">The deputy head of the Institute of procurement экспертно-консультационного Alexander Евсташенков believes that right now, the government has turned to business to Scor contractor.</seg>
<seg id="27">And this example: "A participant when filling in the application must specify" specific performance "without the words" or equivalent "," should "," "," "more," "less than," "similar" "or", "type", "type", not a "lower," "lower," "higher," "can," "may," "might," "earlier" and "no earlier than", not "higher," "not allowed" and so on.</seg>
<seg id="28">Thus, customers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of applications of contractors.</seg>
<seg id="29">Another problem, according to 44-ФЗ Евсташенкова, was the need to assess the quality of the application through the "paper" proposal.</seg>
<seg id="30">Looking at a proposal that actually can be assessed only qualified as a contractor, but not the quality of the works, to which not even began, "the expert said.</seg>
<seg id="31">The quality of the works can be assessed only on their acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="32">The experts also were asked to move a margin on income from the top to the lower echelon to intermediate contractors disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="33">Chairman of the expert committee, espionage, FAS Andrei Цариковский believes that it is not worth it, as responsible for the order should генподрядчик.</seg>
<seg id="34">But otherwise, as in the famous репризе of Arkady Raikin normalises sleeping: "Пуговицам claims to have?"</seg>

<seg id="5">The date of construction of the house amongst others, historians point to the two dates - 1730 and 1737.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in any case, it turns out that the nearly 300 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The old yard, always open the door, squeaky staircase.</seg>
<seg id="8">Doors in the apartments are located near each other, the walls, the chair covers were cracked and peeling plaster просветы places visible from the street.</seg>
<seg id="9">It seems that all the honest word.</seg>
<seg id="10">But local residents are told: "You don't think it is."</seg>
<seg id="11">Live in a wooden house of the 18th century is very difficult, "says Tatiana (1961, a resident of apartment # 3.</seg>
<seg id="12">The object is on госохране, but its contents are not allocated the money for dozens of years, and we feel museum artifacts, which the authorities simply have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">The last renovation was 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The wall even though with great difficulties, but the foundation of the entire прогнил.</seg>
<seg id="15">Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, and once a week in the SOR Shell Extension public bath.</seg>
<seg id="16">How can we be satisfied in such conditions?</seg>
<seg id="17">The road passes directly under the windows, even a pedestrian zone.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tatiana influence behind.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now see what before was only heard: Under the windows of the car rushes.</seg>
<seg id="20">You see, glass дребезжат constantly, can't open a window, and got used to the noise.</seg>
<seg id="21">He gets used to the good and the bad.</seg>
<seg id="22">Our apartment still model, thanks to her husband, he has golden hands.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, we have two rooms, three of them live with her son.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for other families, the conditions are much worse on the second floor ceiling in a little more than one and a half metres tall.</seg>
<seg id="25">In contrast to Tatiana offers guests the roommate out of the apartment No. 6 Lyudmila Старостиной.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nice friendly woman with a cup of coffee and with a sad smile said:</seg>
<seg id="27">We have a one-bedroom apartment, 14.5 m ² on four people, and we live with her husband and daughter with his granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="28">I've been here from the birth of another boundary, has never been seen before, "Lyudmila обводит eyes room: How two sofas, the letter" g "; one of them was the granddaughter with the laptop.</seg>
<seg id="29">Very closely and differs little from a domestic interior: Only beautiful ceilings, "historical."</seg>
<seg id="30">But with the ceiling regularly flows: Tap system doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lyudmila said about his apartment at the same time, as it routinely and competitiveness, which is home to Roman ruins.</seg>
<seg id="32">We have brought in a very old one, and the recent, everyday and legendary:</seg>
<seg id="33">Running water spent about 40 years ago during the last repair.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the same time we have a tiny kitchen and bathroom in закутке from former чулана.</seg>
<seg id="35">We live in a time where квартировал Demidov, the family lived on the second floor of a servant.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our apartment didn't privatized, and why?</seg>
<seg id="37">The median real estate, the privatization of meaning.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still only get cozy apartment, can't apply for more.</seg>
<seg id="39">Already four months ago, promised us расселить, but promises it won't matter.</seg>
<seg id="40">Not used to complain and I will not.</seg>
<seg id="41">In this apartment (room!) lived for an entire dynasty: My grandparents, my mom and dad, I'm with my husband and my daughter with his granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="42">Things happened during that time.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, are vigorous rats ran in the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="44">Look at the walls, they флигеля one-meter wide thickness.</seg>
<seg id="45">They say the solution was involved in eggs, so long rests.</seg>
<seg id="46">House built thoroughly Демидовым, thank you!</seg>
<seg id="47">Perhaps, but so far no one killed or сваей обрушившимся ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="48">Only building still slowly dying in front of us: Boards and logs, floors are rotting house repeatedly failed, we pouring cement, but it is useless - solution goes into the ground, as well.</seg>
<seg id="49">They say it is "under our bathroom the concealed лаз and move to the river White, who once lived here, there have to be protected from the danger, in which case.</seg>
<seg id="50">Their campaign.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lyudmila Starostina said, came to him as a historian, he begged, he began to shoot in the flat excavations.</seg>
<seg id="52">And then urged to give them housing space in exchange for its однушку in October.</seg>
<seg id="53">Lyudmila historian refused:</seg>
<seg id="54">Where are we in daily однушку?</seg>
<seg id="55">And here at least a tiny hope is that will give housing.</seg>
<seg id="56">We agree on the exchange, nothing would not have won.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, the family Старостиных won nothing.</seg>
<seg id="58">The biggest dream Ludmila to Suburban Region, and daughter gave his granddaughter of one 16-year-old from a separate room.</seg>
<seg id="59">The two families have identified two-room apartment instead of the majestic ruins, in which two generations living now.</seg>
<seg id="60">Pretty girl, and Olesya Карсакова from No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.</seg>
<seg id="61">There in two close a total of 23 m ², called apartments, lives with her large family.</seg>
<seg id="62">We just seven people, two of them children.</seg>
<seg id="63">See for yourself what conditions.</seg>
<seg id="64">Butt falls off pieces of plaster and window frames, the walls in the kitchen, and the cross-cutting holes.</seg>
<seg id="65">The water in the кране only cold year round.</seg>
<seg id="66">Walking about the apartments in the old house, so you can make sure that the most fortunate of spouses Lavrentyev apartment No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="67">They occupy the most spacious rooms of the first floor.</seg>
<seg id="68">You are right, a lot of places.</seg>
<seg id="69">In the 75 square, directed three people.</seg>
<seg id="70">We live in those rooms, where legend has it stopped police during his stay in Ufa, "says the head of the family of Alexander Lavrentyev.</seg>
<seg id="71">High ceilings, spacious.</seg>
<seg id="72">One bad - all around the train wreck that is collapsing, falling apart at the seams.</seg>
<seg id="73">Neighbors probably already told.</seg>
<seg id="74">The more suffering we have with floors, wooden boards сгнили, literally beneath the earth from beneath your feet.</seg>
<seg id="75">I put подпорки, wedges, anything in the hall, and in another room, go on a seesaw качаемся, so all you can.</seg>
<seg id="76">The merchant house of Aleksandr Dmitrievich Евдокима can tell you better than any guide.</seg>
<seg id="77">Золотопромышленнику refers to the native, speaks of it with admiration.</seg>
<seg id="78">Indeed, the personality, and the master was незаурядная Кагинского Узянского plants built houses, отливал guns and bells, kept Ural mines.</seg>
<seg id="79">Merchants take pride in an ancestor of real estate heirs, but live under one roof with history no longer want.</seg>
<seg id="80">I lived here as a kid, in the 1940s, of the 20th century, "says Alexander.</seg>
<seg id="81">Then stood around the stables and wooden sentry, and subsequently снесенные.</seg>
<seg id="82">In 1968, wanted to remove, and our home, but something prevented.</seg>
<seg id="83">The same story was repeated again in 2014: Поманили new housing.</seg>
<seg id="84">We, as a team, gathered all the necessary documents, обегали, and suddenly learned that moving to an apartment in 2015 or 2016.</seg>
<seg id="85">Something already doesn't believe in all this.</seg>
<seg id="86">Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan, to learn the fate of their homes.</seg>
<seg id="87">Officials of the occupier was not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="88">Sent from one desk to another, but then, as mockery, issued without a signature piece of paper and printing: "The Ministry of Culture is not objecting to the resettlement of tenants."</seg>
<seg id="89">Even I have a feeling that our house has been there for a long time in terms of the city, because he was at number 57, then became 57 A, now 57 / 1.</seg>
<seg id="90">As if he had already been demolished in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="91">"A planet" to the head of the management sector informational-analytical land resources Ufa Vladimir Барабашу.</seg>
<seg id="92">A house on the street of the October Revolution, 57 / 1 is included in the resettlement programme for the old housing.</seg>
<seg id="93">I can't be responsible for the actions of officials in the 70s, and only know that at the time there was a plan for the demolition of old buildings, despite the historical significance.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the authorities - to restore the old house on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value, "successfully.</seg>
<seg id="95">Tenants in the planned расселить apartments.</seg>
<seg id="96">According to Барабаша, to restore the House of Italian specialists who will be involved in the restoration of buildings in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="97">Now in Italy, and the project is architectural Biennale "Old Ufa" presented there among others.</seg>
<seg id="98">I hope that by 2016 all former Old Street will be on best Western Hotel Tigra was renovated, "said the official.</seg>
<seg id="99">Home purchase order, that was before, three centuries ago.</seg>
<seg id="100">Of the house, is likely to become a museum, open to all comers.</seg>
<seg id="101">In addition, the government decided to make pedestrian street at the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="102">On weekdays, unfortunately, don't get too much workload, roads in the city.</seg>
<seg id="103">People from the future museum расселить Vladimir Barabas promises in 2015.</seg>

<seg id="2">Never say, "I love you"</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was one of seven children born to a family of immigrants from Jamaica in Dudley in often in 1958.</seg>

<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mix of 199.4 and rap, and melodies - жизнерадостны.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, Henry had to get through some difficult memories of childhood.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the death of his mother was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often mused about the relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was very inaccessible.</seg>
<seg id="10">You never saw his face, you only hear his voice: "Don't make noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Отстань from sisters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Шевелись!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch the cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were older, when I was a kid, walked with him in the pub and talk about such things as a form of beer glasses, the beauty of the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">I have never talked with him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was so неулыбчивым guy in the corner, reading a newspaper which is a big part of my life.</seg>
<seg id="17">Henry recently opened the studio are in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in the days of his father, he was able to look at what must have been his life.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now there's a little bit better, but it's dark, дымные labyrinths' full extent, depth of Tartary with outbreaks of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father залезал in a bathtub and just lay there, and you have heard, as he slowly begins to sing about themselves, because he wanted the отмыться broadcasting studio.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I came back, I realised that he was doing it years and years in order to earn money for food, and I began to appreciate it more.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nevertheless, Henry came out of a childhood devoid of parental love.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."</seg>
<seg id="23">Only when her mother became ill at the end of her life, we started to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you.</seg>
<seg id="24">The birth of her own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love with which he lacked as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">You can stop it, "I love you"?</seg>
<seg id="26">Just don't hug me!</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I'm 22!</seg>
<seg id="28">With Dawn French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why would I not to be friends with her?</seg>
<seg id="30">She's a great mother</seg>

<seg id="35">Henry was the mother of the diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="36">He was one of what killed her.</seg>
<seg id="37">So, when I was very, very recovered and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take radical measures.</seg>
<seg id="38">Then I began serious training фитенсом, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="40">And that's boring.</seg>
<seg id="41">No one eats carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">A change of career trajectories of Henry reflected, perhaps, in his noble, briefly подстриженной beard.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he received the recognition of the critics for his Othello, he completely immersed in theatre.</seg>
<seg id="44">It was followed by "Комедия errors," and then "hotel" Огаста Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">This work is different from sitcoms and comedies that were неотъемлимым attribute his busy professional life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He began his career, when he was 16 and worked in a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">DJ noticed, as he is a parody on the stage, and wrote about it in "The new faces."</seg>
<seg id="48">His career in television began in the mid seventies: "Quite a long time I was the only black пародистом / first on television."</seg>
<seg id="49">He studied at work.</seg>
<seg id="50">I not only had to grow in the eyes of the public, I had to learn how to be an efficient vehicle for the delivery of jokes between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working on television, and it was very hard.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny in "New faces" in 1975</seg>
<seg id="52">As his manager had the right to "Black and white minstrels" show, light entertainment program, in which people "чернили themselves face," Henry found that stands in it for five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">My family is a very disliked.</seg>
<seg id="54">I, like, want, in order to ensure that this never happened to me, but I don't regret that I did it.</seg>
<seg id="55">Though it was a strange, worthy of condemnation, I worked on large sites and was working with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="56">But what was "which received awards for light entertainment on British television classics for years and years," and was a "grotesque parody of black people."</seg>
<seg id="57">Introducing characters who were abusive to black culture in the UK, and her perfume, Henry worked in alternative комедийном project in the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="58">The first season of "Show Lenny Henry" was broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as, among other things, the chef Гэрет Блэклок from the comedy series "Biased!."</seg>
<seg id="59">Commercials, documentaries, television series and roles in films took the following ten years of his life, but after his series on the BBC in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "what are you going to do next, Len, because it seems that you little тянешь time or quietly сворачиваешь aside."</seg>
<seg id="60">Next was a series of documentary broadcasts on Radio 4 called "What the...?"</seg>
<seg id="61">The first was about Шекспире.</seg>
<seg id="62">I was a genuine allergy to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">That is not to say that I really have been taught this at school, and I thought that it was, in many ways, the prerogative of white middle class people with колготками and cabbage at the bottom of the front.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I am very afraid of him.</seg>
<seg id="65">All of those we accepted interviews for transmission, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Денч, said: "You have to try.</seg>
<seg id="66">Not ругай it, until you know what you are talking about.</seg>
<seg id="67">Произнеси aloud some of these words, and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry read from the last 20 lines a monologue by a Othello for the documentary, and his зацепило.</seg>
<seg id="69">I have the feeling that I can do it.</seg>
<seg id="70">It's like my head выправили.</seg>
<seg id="71">"That's what it is, this is a serious case, Treat pedestrian seriously, its text, make a small study.</seg>
<seg id="72">So, the process of rehearsal was tough, and I read this play for months and months before we got her.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">It seemed that they had been waiting for disaster, but it has not happened.</seg>
<seg id="75">Soon we began "Комедию mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I was at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you have changed."</seg>
<seg id="78">There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his job is to entertain the public.</seg>
<seg id="79">"The voice inside me said: 'You have to work 10 minutes until they чинят computer."</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead, assistant director announced that view will resume as soon as the problem will be solved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I walked away from the scene and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."</seg>
<seg id="82">It's not my responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can't let someone else deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="84">"You're playing in the play, stay in the role."</seg>
<seg id="85">In "Henry in the theater Дачесс заборах"</seg>
<seg id="86">Learn the text for "Заборов" was difficult.</seg>
<seg id="87">Panic is quite useful, it strengthens muscle.</seg>
<seg id="88">It was too good, so it was a sign of more than showing: "Here's what you need to do."</seg>
<seg id="89">He says it is, of course, Громовым voice.</seg>
<seg id="90">So I держусь this.</seg>
<seg id="91">I really love it.</seg>
<seg id="92">I love being in the репетиционном hall.</seg>
<seg id="93">By the way, Henry still thinking comic - all the way our conversation перебивают flashes of his humour, but when he starts, it finishes to parody.</seg>
<seg id="94">I just decided not to work in стендапе, because this thing with instant gratification from a room full of strangers, I think is quite dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="95">If you try to do all the time, this can lead to a standstill.</seg>
<seg id="96">I sometimes work in "Прямом broadcast in Apollo was, when I want, but, in the main, I don't get so much pleasure as before.</seg>
<seg id="97">I ask, would he give стендапа tour ever.</seg>
<seg id="98">The joy of sitting in a room with the director, who helps shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think I ever wanted it to.</seg>
<seg id="99">This is his new incarnation?</seg>
<seg id="100">I think so.</seg>
<seg id="101">I like to be an actor.</seg>
<seg id="102">It's pretty fun.</seg>
<seg id="103">You always tell a story, and it is a great place for this.</seg>

<seg id="2">Weirdest thing about it, the best way to say it, they gradually разваливались, like a cardboard box that was left in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="3">But sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, hard to communicate, tense, and maybe a little раздражительный.</seg>
<seg id="4">And then she пожимала his hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">He saw in his irritability.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was колючим as hair, yes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The latest victim of this колючести was little novel, from which he waited longer than usual, getting rid of lonely and boring life, and perhaps even some sort of satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Эйлинн Соломонз was as much a fragile beautiful with hair and взлохмаченными трепещущим heart of northern island village, even more remote and harsh than Port Ройбен.</seg>
<seg id="9">She came to the south, that doesn't work with older Кеверн believed her aunt, with the latter in the house in crude, but like Paradise Valley under the name "joyous Райская Valley."</seg>
<seg id="10">No one lived in the house for several years.</seg>
<seg id="11">In defence, trickling pipes sat motionless, spiders слизни left their footprints on all the windows, confident that the house belongs to them; garden зарос weeds, like giant cobs cabbage.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was like a cottage from the children ’ s books, simultaneously frightening and seductive, with a garden full of secrets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Opinion of the author: Howard Джейкобсон, whose novel "J" is included in the лонг-лист Букеровской premiums in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">The shortlist will be announced next week</seg>
<seg id="15">And Кеверн Эйлинн sat, holding hands, broken sun loungers in the high grass, enjoying surprisingly warm spring day; they both "connected to your console, which provided cheap country music and appeasing 3-zmianowy news when, looking at the crossed brown legs, he remembered the old song long forgotten black performer, which he loved to listen to his father, curtains in the house.</seg>
<seg id="16">You have a very big feet.</seg>
<seg id="17">In view of the inherent aggressiveness of this type on the console, no longer lost.</seg>
<seg id="18">They were not banned - nothing in fact was not forbidden, just more of them is not lost.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have become, as the very word архаичными "archaic."</seg>
<seg id="20">Public taste did what would never have achieved orders and regulations, and in the same way as rich people chose among books of memoirs, staying in poverty, cookbooks and love the novels, of all the music they chose ballads.</seg>
<seg id="21">This happens during the day, Кеверн began playing the piano and ideation gross comic voice praise great legs Эйлинн.</seg>
<seg id="22">Эйлинн not understood.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It was popular to the jazz pianist named Фэтс Уоллер", he told her, automatically placing two fingers to his lips.</seg>
<seg id="24">He always did his father to stop the letter "J" before she слетит with his lips.</seg>
<seg id="25">It started with the game, in which they played when he was little.</seg>
<seg id="26">His father played it with his father, as he told him.</seg>
<seg id="27">Start with the word "J," forgetting put two fingers to his mouth, "and it will cost you a penny.</seg>
<seg id="28">It was not a very fun game then, and it was not very fun right now.</seg>
<seg id="29">He knew that from him for this, that's all.</seg>
<seg id="30">He had to explain what is jazz.</seg>
<seg id="31">Эйлинн never heard.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jazz is playing, even though he was not explicitly prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="33">Improvisation went out of fashion.</seg>
<seg id="34">In life, there was only one place "if."</seg>
<seg id="35">When the music started, people wanted to know exactly where it will end.</seg>
<seg id="36">With wit in exactly the same way.</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the unpredictability of the people on the nerves.</seg>
<seg id="38">But jazz was wit, marked with the help of music.</seg>
<seg id="39">Though he had reached the age of 10 years, never слышав about Sammy Дэвисе Младшем, Кеверн knew about jazz from paternal полусекретной коллеции CDs.</seg>
<seg id="40">But at least he did not have to speak Эйлинн that Фэтс Уоллер was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">Given her age, it is unlikely that she remembered a time when popular singers were not black.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again, there are no laws or pressure.</seg>
<seg id="43">Society was docile, and this meant that each segment agreed with gratitude - the gratitude of those уберегла destiny, "with the principle of group predispositions.</seg>
<seg id="44">People афро-карибского origin in temperament and physical characteristics were well in the entertainment and sports, and they sang and ran.</seg>
<seg id="45">Came from the Indian sub-continent, as if by nature talented in everything that concerned the electronics, to ensure that no family is left without a working phone number online.</seg>

<seg id="48">Each according to his abilities.</seg>
<seg id="49">As she had heard only ballads Эйлинн was difficult to understand how offensive the word, who had just sung her Кеверн, could be set to music.</seg>
<seg id="50">Music is an expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">"They didn't really offensive," said Кеверн.</seg>
<seg id="52">Except, maybe, for people who have great legs.</seg>
<seg id="53">My father never offended no one, but he loved this song.</seg>
<seg id="54">He said too much, but you gave him the illusion of security.</seg>
<seg id="55">No word could not penetrate the soundproofing giant leaves, similar to капустные.</seg>
<seg id="56">Эйлинн still did not understand.</seg>
<seg id="57">Like your father could love this?</seg>
<seg id="58">He wanted to say that this is a joke, but he did not want to again if it eases up two fingers to his lips.</seg>
<seg id="59">She already thought it strange.</seg>
<seg id="60">"It was funny," he said instead.</seg>
<seg id="61">She shook her head, European closed Кеверну review.</seg>
<seg id="62">There was nothing in the whole world, in addition to its копны иссиня-черных hair.</seg>
<seg id="63">Nothing, that he would like to watch.</seg>
<seg id="64">"Well, if you say so," she said, in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="65">But this still does not explain why I sing it.</seg>
<seg id="66">She seemed really upset.</seg>
<seg id="67">I have too big feet?</seg>
<seg id="68">He looked at them again.</seg>
<seg id="69">You cannot say no.</seg>

<seg id="71">And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?</seg>
<seg id="72">I hate you?</seg>
<seg id="73">Of course, I don't hate you.</seg>
<seg id="74">It's just this stupid song.</seg>
<seg id="75">He could say: "I love you," but it was too early.</seg>
<seg id="76">"I like you very much because you have thick ankles", tried to say he instead.</seg>
<seg id="77">I have such a perversion.</seg>
<seg id="78">It was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="79">He wanted to make it funny.</seg>
<seg id="80">Attempts by the joke often made him awkward situation, because, like his father, he was missing the soothing charm that could mitigate the cruelty, крывшуюся in whole.</seg>
<seg id="81">Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.</seg>
<seg id="82">Maybe he wanted Кеверн.</seg>
<seg id="83">Despite the good eye.</seg>
<seg id="84">Эйлинн Соломонз she blushed and stood up with the lounger, the console and the wine that they drank.</seg>
<seg id="85">The wine's intoxication, so that he could not serve as an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="86">In his excitement, it seemed, she was trembling, like the leaves of the beings in the weather system.</seg>
<seg id="87">"And you, I like you very much because you have the head of pointless," she said.</seg>
<seg id="88">Though don't like you very much.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was sorry for her and because of the excessive brutality of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she gave him.</seg>
<seg id="90">She thought that he was going to hurt her?</seg>
<seg id="91">She has not talked to him about life in the cold of the northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that, in basic terms, it was like a здешнюю.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same huge icy ocean struck on both of them.</seg>
<seg id="93">The same used to be men, and even more sensitive and capricious after THAT happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened than their ancestors, and smugglers разрушители, shopped in fury from pub to pub, ready to raise a hand on any woman, or to deny them посмевшую поддразнить them.</seg>
<seg id="94">Pointless head?</seg>
<seg id="95">They would have shown her a fist, if she was not cautious.</seg>
<seg id="96">Would be first kissed, kiss now became the most common erotic expression of irritation between a man and a woman; an antidote from fresh ballads, which Google is the first to kiss her, and then hit.</seg>
<seg id="97">Excessive clarification, according to Кеверна because the kiss itself was already хулиганством.</seg>
<seg id="98">Эйлинн Соломонз case showed that he needed to leave.</seg>
<seg id="99">He rose from the lounger, as an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She herself felt lead weight, but the weight of his grief surprised her.</seg>
<seg id="101">This was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They barely knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">She looked, as he goes, and out of an upper window, looked like he was her constant companion, a man, himself at взваливший themselves.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam, the outgoing, she thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">It was an act of compassion towards him and men in general, even though some of them and raised her hand.</seg>
<seg id="106">The man, from the pulpit, отвернувшийся back пристыженный, smitten, the ability to fight left him - why it seemed to her that she knew so well, if she could not recall a single case, until today, when she saw it?</seg>
<seg id="107">Again one Эйлинн Соломонз looked at their feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">For twenty years before the events described above or so Esme cantered Нуссбаум, an intelligent and energetic 32-летняя исследовательница who worked in "Офнау" unofficial service of the Community control mood, has prepared a report on the low and medium levels of violence in most parts of the country, where it was expected that it will be reduced, if not over entirely, given the means and the forces that were allocated to its eradication.</seg>
<seg id="109">"A lot has been done, and a lot is being done," she wrote, "to ease the innate aggressiveness of people who fought in a war and won most of them, especially among these спутанных branches and narrow расселин area, where, despite hovering over изгородями church spires, gentle breathing human kindness was rarely in history.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, some quality, it turns out, неискоренимы.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher, it would seem, the низменнее those passions that he зарождает.</seg>
<seg id="112">People shed tears over his sentimental stories about drinking, skipping преодоленных obstacles and announces its overheated faith in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness retains its strong grip as in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is evidence that a new depth and vile задиристость in homes, in the workplace, on roads and even in playgrounds.</seg>
<seg id="113">"You have досадная habit of writing too much," said her supervisor, read the report as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="114">It seems to me that you should read shorter novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">Esme cantered Нуссбаум lowered her head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask you: You атеистка?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I think that is not obliged to answer," said Esme cantered Нуссбаум.</seg>
<seg id="118">You lesbian?</seg>
<seg id="119">Esme cantered again insisted on his right to privacy and silence.</seg>
<seg id="120">Feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Again, silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I ask," said Luther Рабиновиц, "not because I am against atheism, лесбийства or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">Here we have no prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="124">We are the servants of society without prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="125">But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely reasonable and a good in themselves, they may sometimes distort the results, such as, for example, those that you showed me.</seg>
<seg id="126">It is obvious that you yourself предубеждены against the church, and what you call "malevolent" and "rude", others would be interpreted as an expression of natural and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="127">To continue the нудеть BUT THAT happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened, as if it had happened, if it happened, yesterday, it means depriving the country needed her life force.</seg>
<seg id="128">Esme cantered Нуссбаум огляделась on both sides until Рабиновиц said.</seg>
<seg id="129">Over his head, as well as pink, led the letters repeat advice that "Офнау" gave the country the last quarter of a century or more.</seg>
<seg id="130">His neighbour, улыбайся value of his spouse, listen to ballads, walk, talk on the phone, organise, talk, listen, this fairytale city соглашайся, извиняйся.</seg>
<seg id="131">The conversation is better than silence, word of the song better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I fully understand that you want to say," said Esme cantered Нуссбаум quietly, when satisfied that her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I don't want to say anything, except that we are not излечились as efficiently as we convince ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">What worries me is that if we do not we are ready, we will find that repeat mistakes, which initially led to the ТОМУ ВООБЩЕ IF THAT happened, happened.</seg>
<seg id="134">Only this time we выбросим their anger and distrust the other.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Рабиновиц joined his fingers in a sitting.</seg>
<seg id="136">This gesture would mean an infinite patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"You go too far," he said, "calling" mistakes "actions that made or not made our grandfathers.</seg>
<seg id="138">You go too far and when talking about what they threw away their "anger" and "mistrust" in the "other."</seg>
<seg id="139">In your place, people should not need: About the fact that, in the past, the present, we are not talking about "us" and "them."</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "us" and no "other."</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of turmoil - that's all that we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"For which, to be honest with ourselves," dare to insert Esme cantered, "no part of society may well justify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am not accusing anyone.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it was good or bad, what is done is done.</seg>
<seg id="145">Then it was back then.</seg>
<seg id="146">Nothing needs to be said - here we agree.</seg>
<seg id="147">And don't blame anyone, not excuses, and if this was appropriate, or if it was something to be corrected.</seg>
<seg id="148">But why, if not to learn "</seg>
<seg id="149">Past существет to ensure that we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I can add to that one word -</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther's Great Pyramid Рабиновица collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I'll review your report", he said, by letting go of her.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, on the way to work, and its perpetrators, who rode on the sidewalk мотоциклист, described how passers-by, "the vicious rage."</seg>

<seg id="8">There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi later this week may give further signals that he is contemplating a scheme of quantitative easing in the eurozone, similar to those that have used the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.</seg>

<seg id="79">And I can't stop feeling it.</seg>

<seg id="83">I know that he does not like to remember it, but they are very close with six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and burn candles there.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember he was lying on the couch, facing away from us, for hours on end.</seg>
<seg id="85">Did not sleep, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys. Дамиру now 17, he was above me, nice, smart and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that a few hours I was so sure that he is dead and that I never see more.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I was able to recover from the explosion and rose to his feet, I огляделась, I saw hell around himself when parts of bodies were lying everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely convinced that it is not possible to my little boy could survive in this hell.</seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember what I shouted to him:" Run, Damir, убегай ", but again I was so sure that he had not heard me.</seg>
<seg id="91">But he heard, and ran off.</seg>
<seg id="92">So life goes on for us, unlike so many others.</seg>

<seg id="112">George says now: "It is important that this never happened.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I doubt that we ever learn the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">People continue to investigate this tragedy and will never know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">Now they are investigating the collapse of Boeing in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Will we ever know what it was called?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world is going to something very bad.</seg>
<seg id="118">"I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, because it is happening?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing for this pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need to have a little bit of tens of years to forget it.</seg>
<seg id="121">It has affected my health, and I still feel it.</seg>
<seg id="122">About three or four years of nightmares because of me, but now it became better.</seg>

<seg id="124">I thought about my friends and одноклассниках who have been killed.</seg>
<seg id="125">That's why I continue to walk into the gym before each on 1 September.</seg>
<seg id="126">I want to pay tribute to the memory of my old friends from childhood.</seg>

<seg id="138">Incredible: George Фарниев was at the feet of террориста-убийцы during capture, but still he managed to survive</seg>
<seg id="139">During the seizure, however in the gym he was sitting next to a bomb at the feet of террориста-убийцы.</seg>
<seg id="140">Indeed, it is a miracle that he was not killed.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It seems to us that it was yesterday," says Giorgi, who wanted to learn from the intelligence officer in the Federal Security Service (FSB), but couldn't because of the damage that was caused by his health at the time of the capture.</seg>
<seg id="142">It's still with me, this is not something that I left behind.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am older now, and they say that children can easily cope with bad events, I must say that this is not true.</seg>

<seg id="152">With regard to the physical condition, I'm healthy.</seg>
<seg id="153">I need to be cautious with the knee, which was damaged, but now I go okay.</seg>
<seg id="154">But health is not allowed me to go to study at the Academy of the Federal Security Service in St Petersburg, as I wanted to.</seg>
<seg id="155">I sent my documents, including the medical opinions, and they said that was impossible.</seg>

<seg id="157">I studied there for two years.</seg>

<seg id="159">He said: "I know that would never tell their children about their experience.</seg>
<seg id="160">It is not what children should know, and, of course, is not what they need to survive.</seg>
<seg id="161">His mother, Marina, 42, said: "The pain never leaves me.</seg>
<seg id="162">She's in my soul, and worse, when the anniversary is approaching.</seg>
<seg id="163">I will go and will be present at the ceremonies, which will be held, to celebrate her.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know that George did not go.</seg>
<seg id="165">For him it should be even stronger, because he was there, and I'm not.</seg>
<seg id="166">I was waiting for him at home and could not help.</seg>
<seg id="167">I am so grateful to God that he came back to me: Here, in Beslan imprint lies on each.</seg>
<seg id="168">He remains with us.</seg>
<seg id="169">George, now an adult, but the nightmare was still with him.</seg>
<seg id="170">It is difficult to take when something so terribly unfair, happens to you.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do because of the knee.</seg>
<seg id="172">He had several operations, he can walk, but he can't exercise.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say that the 50 per cent he overcame this nightmare, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.</seg>
<seg id="174">This eerie experience will remain with us.</seg>
<seg id="175">Many of my friends and neighbors had been killed during the capture, and this only reinforces my pain.</seg>
<seg id="176">I lost a lot of people who I knew well and who were dear to me.</seg>
<seg id="177">My son with me, and this is the best gift that God could I do, but my heart aches for those who were killed.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know the family, where the children were born, but I know and widows who never married.</seg>
<seg id="179">It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.</seg>
<seg id="180">I will never forget how heart выпрыгнуло out of my chest at that moment, when I saw him in the hospital.</seg>

<seg id="182">These people are fighting for that?</seg>
<seg id="183">Why are they killing each other?</seg>
<seg id="184">The war is very close to our country right now, and I can hardly believe it.</seg>
<seg id="185">We were a close-knit country in the past, how did it come about that we are fighting now?</seg>
<seg id="186">Men and children are suffering, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine, and many will be killed.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips, how to achieve a better quality of underwater photos and video</seg>
<seg id="2">If you want to take pictures or shoot video under the water, you have a number of options.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is waterproof "мыльница", for example, the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or, for example, GoPro Hero3 экшн-камера + Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I took these pictures on a family holiday with the help of a few cameras, all for the price of about $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">No matter what equipment you are using, you need to comply with several regulations, in order to achieve the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Перепроверяйте their equipment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the case and any other branch of the tightly closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, set up their camera for the type of photos or videos that you shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some of the photo and video cameras filming or object type is regimes that optimise exposure for mages underwater conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in the water, look at how deeply your equipment can fall.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are aimed only at 5 feet, while others are 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Look at our leadership and the ratings of digital cameras for both traditional and catalog models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Remove a few frames - because many of them don't you ’ ll get.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Мыльниц" LCD that can help you take, then assign them as экшн-камер usually don't.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have LCD, it would be difficult to see under the water, and the layout of the frame is a random process.</seg>
<seg id="16">So do a few frames.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also, if your camera is serial shooting mode, which takes several shots with slightly different plant, use them.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">The amount of light is significantly reduced, the deeper you нырнете under water.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, stay at the surface, when you're shooting in the pool, the river or the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">It also allows you to transmit more colors in the photos; the deeper you can color, the fewer you'll see.</seg>
<seg id="22">Подплывайте closer to objects.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is excellent advice for shooting on the land, but it is even more important under water because of the mages light conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is especially important if you're shooting on экшн-камеру: This equipment often comes with a fixed, широкоугольной Backwards, which means that you have to get close to it, if you want to fill the frame.</seg>

<seg id="2">Консультирующий anaesthetist, he has devoted his career needs of patients suffering from the disease and the treatment of remorse.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among those who spoke to him, recalls his wife, M16 officer who had been living with the devastating effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that as long as doctors being passionate about disease and treatment for those who are mainly concerned about something completely different - the pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, however, he appeared to those who suffer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I never felt, as usual," he wrote in May last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">It was hard to find in themselves the strength.</seg>
<seg id="8">Struggling with symptoms similar to flu, he found that his wife, Джулиет reproaches irritably.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I wish it was sooner rather than later," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Джулиет left for a week, Lawson found that unusual and it is unclear why he was upset.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked a colleague to chest X-rays.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks before he went skiing in the French Alps in the Alps.</seg>
<seg id="14">The results of the X-rays came.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was mesothelioma, a terminal cancer, which affects плевру shell, or lungs.</seg>
<seg id="16">For most cancers, it is difficult to determine an exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although some people succumb to the cancer of the lung, for example, not all cancer patients smoking lung.</seg>
<seg id="18">But with mesothelioma differently.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, grainy construction material, who once called a "miracle," but which, as we now know, deadly dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us is a disease of mesothelioma, which can be not to pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos, in the end, is the stuff from the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in the UK since the 1960s, when these industrial ban came into force.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even when it has been used, only people from specific sectors worked in close contact with him: Трубоизолировщики, builders, carpenters and workers dock-Yards, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">Industrial toxin from another era, it hardly seems a cause for concern today.</seg>
<seg id="25">But such a calm erroneously.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it turns out, is now at the peak of the epidemic мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="27">Here мезотелиомы dies from more people than in any other country on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="28">The annual death rate at about 2500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease than as a result of road accidents.</seg>
<seg id="29">The annual number of deaths from мезотелиомы since 1980 and projected the number of deaths in the UK in the future</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason we feel its deadly consequences right now, lies in the fact that, although the use of asbestos it is illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), for the development of мезотелиомы go usually tens of years.</seg>
<seg id="31">And attack мезотелиомы veterans is not limited to industrial specialties.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was, and in many cases, remains in the house where we live, where we work, offices, schools, shops, where we are and where we go shopping.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention in class, the level of income, profession or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">Избранности bastions of London fashion department stores to private schools, as it turned out, not salvation.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parliament building is riddled with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even hospitals that are designed to treat us, turned out to be reservoirs of this mortal a carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was not трубоизолировщиком.</seg>
<seg id="39">In fact, he had to think where he might have come into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he realized.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It seems that could be a lot of asbestos in tunnels in the hospital, where I spent six years on an internship," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">All are students, nurses, doctors, and by chance - used these тоннелями.</seg>
<seg id="43">I wonder how many of my peers expect the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">It was a question to which, unfortunately, he was able to give a partial response.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Of the four doctors who in Guy's Hospital and have subsequently developed mesothelioma for the past five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I alone remained alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us expect this disease?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Лоусону was diagnosed with mesothelioma, "" when he was 48 years old.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on 17 February this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">To live so long.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty percent of patients die from mesothelioma eight months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">She always lethal.</seg>
<seg id="52">So, now, we can only repeat the question: "How many of us Лоусона expect this disease?"</seg>
<seg id="53">According to a leading expert on type in the UK, Professor Julian Пито, most likely assume that the years between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain should be an emotional over-reactions, some will die.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most now are not that would die that way.</seg>
<seg id="55">Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada with</seg>
<seg id="56">A quick review of reports from the halls of the court, where victims are often seek compensation, shows how far it has spread attack мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="57">In this June, for example, Marks & Spencer acknowledged that the tortured Джэнис Ellen contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, apparel departments at two sites, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs Ellen was only 18 years old, when she started working at M & S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now her two children are older than 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Before this happened," she says, "I had never heard about the type, I barely knew about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="62">And in my head I could not come, so that will affect me.</seg>
<seg id="63">Few people really know a lot about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="64">In fact, asbestos is not one substance, and a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">They get their name from the word "асбестиформ", which means the fibrous structure that informs them strength and flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="66">Of those six, three were often used in the construction.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, is much more common in other buildings today.</seg>
<seg id="68">It has been used in roofing panels, used his thermal insulation boilers, pipes, toilets, even the Turkish First Football League titles won.</seg>
<seg id="69">He less смертелен than other forms of asbestos, but still recognised by the European Union and the World Health Organization, "a source of serious health damage," which can lead to death.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, brown asbestos (амозит) and blue asbestos (крокидолит).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts have speculated that "there are good, though indirect reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with mesothelioma [in the UK]."</seg>
<seg id="72">A worker at Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the main store on London's Oxford Street, with</seg>
<seg id="73">Джэнис Ellen may not have thought of themselves as a victim, but Julian Пито мезотелиомы work suggests that her story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that a significant percentage of мезотелиом when there is no known exposure at work or at home, were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment. "</seg>
<seg id="75">Much of this impact, he says, is "a normal usage and the impact of weather on our building.</seg>
<seg id="76">No one, it seems, can't be sure that he is safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">The report Goddard Consulting, which was considered Westminster Palace, demonstrates how people, even in the heart of government, may have been exposed to unconsciously.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009, Goddard said that technical mines and pipelines for the premises of parliamentary committees were infected, deadly asbestos fibres which could follow in the movement, something so harmless as "strong currents of air."</seg>
<seg id="79">Members of the parliament often blame the fact that they are pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.</seg>
<seg id="80">Although for maintenance of Parliament insisted that Westminster Palace received a "clean bill of health," and now she recognized that it is necessary to work on the £1 billion for the reconstruction of the Parliament, by upgrading electrician and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, members of parliament, will meet in the conference centre close to the capital, and was not green benches.</seg>
<seg id="81">The report Goddard said that "the situation with the asbestos does not manage, in accordance with the various rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">It is impossible to know whether this error management cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All I can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">One of those who could not identify their contact with asbestos, is Graham Эбботт, general practitioner.</seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson, Эбботт, 50 years, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I was working at the hospital, which has successfully brought claims associated with asbestos," he says, "But I can't prove this in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It's so hard to remember all the places where he worked, and dates.</seg>
<seg id="88">He remembers clearly, so this day in early December 2009 when his wholly overcame something that was like the flu.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">All of a sudden were shaken as I began.</seg>
<seg id="91">It started very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terrible.</seg>
<seg id="93">I thought that I won't be able to drive all the way to homes.</seg>
<seg id="94">As a doctor, Эбботт knew that pain comes from, including checking for iframe loads a shell around the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="95">However, as Джэнис Ellen, he just did not have reason to suspect мезотелиому.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the end, he could not walk to work a month.</seg>
<seg id="97">US doctors doing chest x-rays and плевральные катетеры to pull fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis.</seg>
<seg id="98">And yet his condition оставлось without a diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">Gradually, his health has improved, and he returned to work.</seg>
<seg id="100">But from time to time the same symptoms return, often after he engaged in sports, and he breathed heavily.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, one of the patients came to him in Dubai office with similar symptoms, and he was later diagnosed with mesothelioma. ""</seg>
<seg id="102">But even then it's not Эбботт [with their own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">In the end, his patient was on dozens of years older and worked with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">In this case, the connection was obvious.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011, the state of Dubai has worsened again, and listened to his doctor showed him the results of the CT and X-ray images of the group.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, just two years after Эбботт began to feel ill, sensor, equipped with a camera, was introduced into his chest cavity between the shell, and the shell of his lung.</seg>
<seg id="107">I'm an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I usually just go further, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="109">I'm not too upset about it, to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife was.</seg>
<seg id="111">Biopsy results came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that it was mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham Эбботт: Diagnosed with mesothelioma</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly Эбботт sank in meetings with Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested he contact a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">It was then he realised the scale of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turns out that asbestos is widely used, especially in large public buildings, and where quite often there was asbestos thermal insulation systems on the planet," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, now succumb to the disease.</seg>
<seg id="117">Thus, mesothelioma now affects more young people, atypical professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous asbestos pipes isolated in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees, who were crossing the tunnels connecting nearby landmasses can bring together to get from one building to another (as Andrew Lawson), or eat in the basement canteens (how often did Graham Эбботт) almost certainly really were exposed to toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">For several decades after the war, as it turns out, the hospital was a place where, in theory, life remains in place, but поциентов, which constituted a threat to life for doctors who treated them.</seg>
<seg id="121">It still continues to remove today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students set their burners Бунзена 3rd on tap</seg>
<seg id="123">And it's not just hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and мэриях because of his amazing insulating and огнестойких characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="125">Schools too.</seg>
<seg id="126">In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the classroom for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="127">Across the country, countless chemistry lessons, students set their burners Бунзена 3rd in the cradle.</seg>
<seg id="128">Websites have appeared, highlighting the problem of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as floor tiles or roof сараев typically contained asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"It's an industrial poison in a huge number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Лоусона Guy in a case against the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case, the only contact the woman could remember was the demolition garden shed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So be careful, снося garden sheds.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effect of the diagnosis, when we know that the disease is incurable, is huge.</seg>
<seg id="134">"To realize it, is quite a lot of time," says Graham Эбботт.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to continue, but realized that I couldn't focus on what I'm doing.</seg>
<seg id="136">I spent two weeks in surgery.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I realized that I had to go out and deal with them.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I don't meet Christmas</seg>
<seg id="139">One of the most difficult things was the transition from doctor to patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">Like countless people before him, he remembers, was confused with information that should have been taken.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was difficult to understand," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked his doctor" how many I have time? "</seg>
<seg id="143">I was given about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember, as I thought, "Well, I don't meet Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's all. "</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, as it is the mechanics of how we are in life, "the very act of breathing, raises cancer, which kills.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases are caused by мезотелиомы contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos is composed of tiny fibers.</seg>
<seg id="149">When asbestos is being destroyed and the carcinogenic fibers, they can get stuck in the lungs, плевре shell.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibers are annoying плевру and can cause mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem is due to the inhalation of asbestos fibres needle," Professor Tom Трежер, кардиоторакальный surgeon, who came to the hospital in 2001, Guy.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is the hospital, where, as suspected, Andrew Lawson, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="153">Трежер knew Лоусона and treated some of the others who, perhaps, was exposed to while in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">When Sally Goodin Sally goodun Etc asbestos into the lung tissue, "says Трежер, breathing their course on the periphery, where the shell.</seg>
<seg id="155">It is, in essence, invasive process from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="156">Conventional treatments of other forms of cancer is much less effective in type.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is controversial.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some think it's worth a try.</seg>
<seg id="159">Трежер disagrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">"You can't cut плевру," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">No good around her with a knife.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, the cancer is "not very well to chemotherapy," which "acts", but not people.</seg>
<seg id="163">"From time to time there are patients who live for a long time," says Трежер.</seg>
<seg id="164">But ultimately, they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some patients are living much, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">Writer Stephen Jay Gould who died 20 years after being diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years after diagnosis, Graham Эбботт continues to fight.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he became ill from mesothelioma, Dubai introduced Andrew Лоусоном, which, four years after the diagnosis, single-handedly turned into office support and consultation for these same patients.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Yes, Раковая Central," he said cheerfully, as they are called.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," says Эбботт.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was diagnosed four years ago, and he still is very energetic.</seg>
<seg id="172">First Эбботту offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and would have prolonged his life only a month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was in despair," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, "managed to somewhat more positive agenda."</seg>
<seg id="176">Meeting with several specialists, Эбботт decided to continue treatment with Professor Лоиком Ланж-Лаздунски торакальной, a professor of surgery at Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage in that I don't need it, I just called them and they took me," admits Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">Likely the patient would have to get the direction and approval for funding.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money plays a pivotal role for patients with mesothelioma, so as to get the best available treatments.</seg>
<seg id="180">But when such treatments become ineffective, finally, inevitably, many patients still face with one financial reason for concern "about the future of the families that they will leave.</seg>
<seg id="181">And then they turn to the courts for compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan, of Field Fisher Price Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It has been known that asbestos is harmful to health, in 1898," said Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But that changed in the 1960s, it became clear that even very small amounts of health could be at risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">It was then spoke about the bad faith.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson, and Guy's Hospital, ultimately, resolve the case, but it was not "the full cost of the settlement," according to Morgan, as Lawson could not clearly prove that his mesothelioma as a result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation into his death, hospital spokesman Guy still confirmed, however, that "asbestos in its basement, mentioned above, was removed in the 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="188">It was too late for Andrew Лоусона.</seg>
<seg id="189">How to remove asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">In fact, some contact with deadly asbestos to one company or place of work - usually through dozens of years after that - it turned out to be a big problem for patients with mesothelioma, demanding compensation.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have changed owner or shut down.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance archives could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who are protected from lawsuits, knows that time is on their side, plaintiffs have, of course, no.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, this year took serious new legislative acts which facilitate patients with mesothelioma compensation recovery process, even if it is impossible to keep track of their former employers.</seg>
<seg id="195">In accordance with this law, was created by £350-миллионный fund of funds, which is financed by the insurance industry, for those who had been diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove to the contact, but not anyone with whom to sue.</seg>
<seg id="196">In such cases, patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in a case for compensation - about £pirates.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful claims under this scheme is expected to be every year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with mesothelioma, believes that the £350 million represent a "very good work" for the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"This transaction, written by companies for insurers," he says, hinting that the sum is a quarter of that, insurers would have to pay, if not intervened time and patients with mesothelioma could track the company and file a lawsuit in the usual way.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even Mike Пеннинг, previously minister of labour and pensions, acknowledged that the law "deficient."</seg>
<seg id="201">But Пеннинг, and Morgan acknowledged that, in view of the fact that seven people die every day, rapid action was needed.</seg>
<seg id="202">"People suffer so much, and they need help now," said Пеннинг during the second reading of the Bill about type in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">By the time Graham Эбботт was in the hands of Professor Лоика Ланж-Лаздунски 19 months.</seg>
<seg id="204">After the initial consultation Ланж-Лаздунски recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Трежера, he believes to be effective.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was followed by radiation and chemotherapy -- тритерапия, in which entire Ланж-Лаздунски boasts 40 per cent of patients surviving for five years.</seg>
<seg id="206">Эбботт felt a surge of strength.</seg>
<seg id="207">"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says Эбботт.</seg>
<seg id="208">You see these patients all the time.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is a force that supports you.</seg>
<seg id="210">When сдаешься, condition can deteriorate very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham Эбботт went to the surgery in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">By the end of August he finished the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">The scan showed no trace of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I did a scan in March [2014].</seg>
<seg id="215">There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I just had to be 50.</seg>
<seg id="217">This is not a threat.</seg>
<seg id="218">This is the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="219">And again Эбботт went through six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now there is no trace of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="221">However, this process is both physically and emotionally heavy.</seg>
<seg id="222">You can think about practical things - about finances, and when I die, for example, or about the fact that we need to show his wife, works as a timer on a big PRB.</seg>
<seg id="223">When you get bad news, you become безрадостным.</seg>
<seg id="224">You need to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="225">As a father, Ellie, 16, and 14 years of age, this Тэмзин is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">"It's hard for the parent," he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.</seg>
<seg id="228">For the first time when I was diagnosed, I told the girls that I had the disease, which means that I won ’ t live to old age.</seg>
<seg id="229">They reacted very differently.</seg>
<seg id="230">Тэмзин very social and energetic.</seg>
<seg id="231">She told all of my friends, and we received many very quickly.</seg>

<seg id="234">Such talk is something that all cancer patients have to face.</seg>
<seg id="235">But for patients with mesothelioma, such discussions are not people hope, even tenor to survive.</seg>
<seg id="236">The disease is sex (even as, ultimately, for Steven Jay Гулда) grim certainty.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose their leaders; protesters promise revenge</seg>
<seg id="2">China's parliament decided Sunday to not allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reforms.</seg>
<seg id="3">Such a move is likely to mark the beginning of being long protests in Hong Kong as activists have begun planning and mobilization in a matter of hours after that statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the 11th National People's Congress, in fact, communist leaders to remove all the candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's not обмануло our expectations, but still leads in rage," said lawmaker Emily VAH, chairman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is not something that Beijing has promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">They lied to the people of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defending the decision of China, Li Fei, deputy general secretary of the Standing Committee of the 11th National People's Congress, said that to allow national elections to nominate the head of Hong Kong would be too "protests."</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing promised to allow residents to vote by the head of the government, starting in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Sunday, Chinese leaders have taken the decision as a democratic step forward, since it gives a direct vote гонконгцам right; however, the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process in his hands with the help of the Commission on the appointment of candidates, rigidly controlled from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, according to a new article that only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be admitted.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision was taken after the summer, when there have been some of the most large-scale and received widespread publicity the protests in Hong Kong for many years.</seg>
<seg id="14">For a large part of the campaign after Occupy Central movement in Hong Kong is With Love and Peace, which threatened to cut off the financial district in Hong Kong if Beijing does not guarantee real universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday evening, several hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="16">The demonstration, which organisers claimed that their movement is shifting to a new phase of civil disobedience and that they rise up on the waves of protest in subsequent weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, they have not reported the details, obviously, to avoid problems with state authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In онлайн-заявлении organizers reported that "the ability to capture the central region обдумывало only as an exceptional measure, action that can be taken only if all the possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We regret to inform you that today, all possibilities have been exhausted and the dialogue will certainly central district.</seg>
<seg id="20">Authorities in Hong Kong were preparing to Beijing a few days, and on Sunday at the headquarters of the government were reinforced security measures involving police and barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">The unrest is the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their own city.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">The fear is that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some have criticised Occupy Central movement, saying that his demonstration to jeopardize the businesses - the lifeblood of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protest, which they say, it can lead to great economic damage, depending on how many people will participate, and for how long," said lawmaker Regina today, which has long been critical of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="26">We do not want to spread concern about the fact that Hong Kong can spin out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This view, which is harmful for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chinese state media have also reported in recent days in which Hong Kong activists of the democratic movement, they were shown направляемыми Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral law, which drew members of the 7th - more than one-fifth of voters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in July, tens of thousands took to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists brought up the issue of race and the behaviour of the police after Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">Unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Фергюсоне, Missouri, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">Coming raise hands, chanting: "Hands up, don't стреляй" while they wait in line in front of the burial.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Missouri, Фергюсоне, associated with the murder of teenager Michael Brown, Scale blogger Miriam зоила Perez noticed a shift in интернет-разговоре among white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">In her experience, the white feminists stamps comments put gender above race, when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, as tensions grew in the Midwest and attracted national attention, Peres saw the responses of white women who focused 100 percent on the race.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared with the reaction of black women shortly after the killing on 9 August, personal essays with such titles as "thoughts about Фергюсоне on behalf of a white woman" and "Феминизм is not only an example to women" appeared relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Perez, they demonstrated a significant shift.</seg>
<seg id="9">"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who are talking about white skin and Privileges on such a high level," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People feel the need to say something about what has happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is a very symbolic for the crisis with which we are faced, and because (the situation in Фергюсоне) is so tied to race, they feel that this needs to be set.</seg>
<seg id="12">For Professor of English at the University of Ohio Кориты Mitchell Ferguson has laid bare the problems faced by blacks one every day, but which are not perceived as "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner and get 150 лайков from everywhere," says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">When I write something about how colored people are attacked in his own country, silence оглушает.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Why do women safely publicly talk about relationships, but not about the security in the public sector?" She asks.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women, like Mitchell, who studied questions of race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between matters relating to race and gender.</seg>
<seg id="17">From her point of view, blacks, women are in a position to clearly separate the problems; they are faced with a complex reality every day.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women now bring together issues of race and gender in feminist мейнстриме Хэттери, a professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that its predecessor did.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 1865 and 1890 years линчевали, at least 10,000 black men, and it is almost always served as the rape of white women," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="20">There was a white woman, was the story to justify Nepal.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the point of view of Хэттери, the gap between white and black women, while white суфражистки, for instance, Susan B. Anthony looked at the situation in the late 1800s, and saw that the fight for suffrage will be effective only for one of the groups: Women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They decided to lay all the eggs in the basket of voting rights for women, and the right to vote for blacks would appear later," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="23">To look back on this kind of thing gives us a clear idea of why colored women don't trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have not done anything good.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>

<seg id="3">The plan drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals - reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is expected that the document will be passed in late September and early October, says Плужников, proposed measures concern the development plan for the development of electric cars and hybrids - vehicles on газомоторном fuel in Russia already have.</seg>
<seg id="5">(A copy of the plan obtained by Vedomosti is designed for 2014-2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">To develop the criteria for the assessment of electricity and hybrid vehicles and decide how to promote the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">The government report, which will be described in the tax and customs measures quality support, will be prepared by December 2014, the scheme and a preferential lending will be available by April 2015, and proposals to reduce prices, and encourage the creation of service the infrastructure will be developed by October 2015</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014-2015, proposed to amend the regulations to ease conditions for the construction of the infrastructure charge (parking, petrol stations etc.).</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, federal officials plan to for 2015 to formulate proposals for regional authorities, as well as to promote the use of clean transport - in the form of providing him with the movement and parking, for example; and by February 2016 and the expansion of government purchases of such transport.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, the Ministry of Economic Development by October 2014 will depend on the evaluation of the activities of the regional authorities of criteria that reflect the effectiveness of support production of environmentally clean transport, the development of the infrastructure charge.</seg>
<seg id="11">U.S. market in Russia is still only formed in 2013 across the country sold around 100 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the beginning of the 2014 обнулена an import duty on electric cars, so sales will be approximately 500 pieces, predicts CEO of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="13">But пятикратный growth does not make any noticeable: Electric cars in Russia in 2013, according to the Association of European Businesses, sold by 1.50 million cars and light commercial vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="14">Until the Sunderland plant in Russia imports only Mitsubishi Motors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Start import preparing Renault - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says director for strategic planning and partnerships in Russia Renault Nicolas Ремиз.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most other manufacturers of electric vehicles took in relation to Russia is taking a wait-and-see approach.</seg>
<seg id="17">Development of electric cars and Russian manufacturers GAZ CEO, "", "", but the Foreign Ministry release.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in January - July 2014, according to the "АСМ-холдинга," Avtovaz has issued 30 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="19">Demand due to modest cost, admits director of AvtoVAZ in Latvia, Sergei Аманов, without state support the breakthrough in this segment will not.</seg>
<seg id="20">The development of the Russian market, in addition to the cost of electric cars (those electric cars that are sold in Russia, on average, twice as much as rivals with internal combustion engines) holds an underdeveloped infrastructure charge ("unit"), "sighs CEO Sergei Автостата Целиков.</seg>
<seg id="21">Because of the soaring prices and low rates of reducing the cost of electric cars in the next 3-4 years remain нишевым segment of the Russian market, "said chief editor Mikhail Авторевю Подорожанский Целиков, agrees with him.</seg>
<seg id="22">Manufacturers, by contrast, say that some models of electric cars is already close to the value of the ordinary.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Russian market prospects Lt., the important thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "real" электромобильность; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of the new charging stations, underscores the President BMW Group in Russia Wolfgang Шлимме.</seg>
<seg id="24">Such infrastructure projects, for example, is the "Россети": In Moscow several stations, soon there will be about 80.</seg>
<seg id="25">The talks on the construction of the network "and negotiations with other regions.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to Director of "Россетей" Vladimir Софьина, the company believes the market is ready to build electric and gas stations across the country, but there are problems: A small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric cars of various brands.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, "Россети" as network the company does not have the right to engage in the sale of electricity, the ability to do this in relation to charge electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="28">His wife believes the most effective measure in state support for Russia's single market progeSOFT customs duties.</seg>
<seg id="29">Zero rate will act before the end of 2014, its extension, expansion of the preferential list.</seg>
<seg id="30">Replacement transport tax on ecological (the idea is being discussed and concerns all machines), too, will support the market, but not as noticeably as customs preferences, his wife said.</seg>
<seg id="31">Transport tax in Russia is relatively small, said Pankov, unlike, for example, from Norway, where the tax has led to a sharp increase in electric sales - now they account for 12% of the market.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, and the need for stimulus measures, such as free parking in the centre of town (as it did in Moscow), I am sure, or 25 years of dedicated lanes for electric cars, which are not yet in Russia.</seg>

<seg id="7">The weakening of the ruble is long-term in nature and, in tandem with the euro, and in tandem with the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="8">The long-term forecast assumed that mark, "says senior analyst" Альпари "Anna Bodrov's.</seg>
<seg id="9">All of that has to do with Ukraine, one way or another will be reflected on the courses.</seg>
<seg id="10">As long as this continues, investors will react.</seg>

<seg id="18">It will also look at whether to impose sanctions on Saturday promised, as will meet NATO.</seg>
<seg id="19">According to him, the ruble weakened sharply after the tax season, then went to the news on Ukraine, the Central Bank, last week said that, before the end of the year to a fully floating exchange rate and waives any currency interventions.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you look at the daytime wobble, it is no different from the previous ones during this month, all have spooked the mark in 37 rubles, "analyst continues.</seg>
<seg id="21">And so, in terms of turnover - nothing has happened.</seg>
<seg id="22">Worrying times for the foreign exchange market, I would like to remind you, when at the end of January, was the strong demand for the currency, as well as a third of March, when the Central Bank отгрузил a record number of currency.</seg>
<seg id="23">In UFS IC and see the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="24">First of all, the growth of revenue from export operations, as well as to increase the competitiveness of domestic manufacturers at the expense of more expensive imports, "says chief analyst UFS IC Alexei Kozlov.</seg>
<seg id="25">Negative moments can be attributed to the cost of imported goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of the investment in the Russian economy, encourage the growth of global inflationary pressures and, as a consequence, are the cause of more expensive borrowing money, which, in turn, slows down the country's economic development.</seg>
<seg id="27">If we talk about the stock market, the rouble devaluation smoothes over a fall in share prices, expressed in roubles.</seg>
<seg id="28">For example, the MICEX index during trading Thursday fell 1.67 per cent, while the RTS Index lost 3.27 percent.</seg>
<seg id="29">Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of reduction of indices due to the weakening of the ruble during the day more than 1.5%.</seg>
<seg id="30">The weakening of the ruble is an emotional character and can be explained by a desire to buy the currency.</seg>
<seg id="31">In practice, gradually emotions go on, and the rouble was partially or fully restore lost ground.</seg>
<seg id="32">"We believe, soon we will be able to see the value of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles to the dollar," said Alexei Kozlov.</seg>

<seg id="1">The tax burden on business is growing as the Washington area economy</seg>
<seg id="2">Восстанавливающаяся economy means more customers, the more sales and jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Accounts for taxes at the state and local level for companies across the country, rose modestly last year, when the economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study, published last week, and the company in the Washington area is no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion in the coffers of the state and local level in fiscal 2013, to 3.8 percent more than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tax burden on business in the state and local level in the past year rose by 4.3 per cent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after overtaking each other years when accounts declined in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">State taxes, rose 4.3 percent, faster than the local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to the research, which was carried out by professional services firm, Ernst & Young and the Center for taxation by the state tax policy.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the tax revenue in the county, 56 percent, in taxes on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of tax revenue for Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia, with 28 percent, is the lowest in proportion to the amount of tax revenue from businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">To a large extent, is caused by the growth of tax revenues return to the same level of the value of real estate companies, the researchers say, that raised property taxes by 3.7 per cent this year, after three years in a row, when growth was less than 1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large percentage of these books are in large states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same thing is happening in the Washington area.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion property taxes at the state and local level in the past year, to $9.6 billion more than in 2012, an increase of 4.2 per cent, compared with the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the return of the value of the property does not have a similar effect on the growth of tax revenue for the state and local level in Maryland, where property taxes barely exceed one-fifth of companies' tax bills.</seg>
<seg id="14">Virginia and the District of Columbia are paying about half the tax bills at the state and local level, in the form of taxes on real estate.</seg>
<seg id="15">"What is happening in Maryland is that such a large part of their property, particularly tax base around the District of Columbia belongs to either the government or nonprofit organization that does not pay property taxes," said Douglas Линдхолм, executive director of the Center on taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, Maryland is forced to rely much more on personal income taxes, for example, to pay for those services that exist in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent increase in tax receipts from businesses cannot fully explain the recovery of the real estate market.</seg>
<seg id="18">Income entrepreneurs also, it seems to me, is on the mend, according to this data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Companies in the region, Chinese corporate income tax at a level of $2.3 billion to $2.1 billion more than in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland has collected $1 billion of corporate income tax, the most in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although trends are aimed in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase with the same speed in all three areas.</seg>
<seg id="22">The level of growth in the District of Columbia was on the same level as the average for the country of 4.3 per cent, while growth was significantly faster in Maryland, 4.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only Virginia was the rise in tax revenues, equal to the 4.1 per cent below average.</seg>
<seg id="24">In Virginia was the lowest corporate income tax from three jurisdictions (each of whom the same corporate rate) equal to 6 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Maryland corporate rate of 8.25 percent, whereas in the District is relatively high - 9,975 percent.</seg>
<seg id="26">A similar study of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year in Virginia found that lower taxes for entrepreneurs at the state and local level and, on the whole, a more favorable climate in terms of taxes for entrepreneurs than in Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="27">The district has not been evaluated in this study.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite his advantage, Virginia is facing competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south.</seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina recently signed a legislative act, as corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="30">If, by contrast, will continue to be targets in the next year, this law would bring the tax rate for entrepreneurs, even up to 3 per cent by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="31">Meanwhile, a small business in the Washington area, it seems, feels better and, thus, pay more in taxes at the state and local level, according to a recent study.</seg>
<seg id="32">Taxes for entrepreneurs, in the form of individual income tax paid by the owners of small businesses is a transitional structure, the things that most of the small firms, in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, with much greater growth than taxes for предпринимателй in general.</seg>
<seg id="33">The researchers say that the trend and an increase in revenues from taxes on businesses across the country are likely to persist this year, when tax revenues, with turnover in the governments of the state and local level, staying at 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.</seg>

<seg id="3">The duo Royal Blood all year on the stage, but already has the musical award nomination for the BBC, the opening act on the tour and a visit to the Arctic Monkeys gig from the New York-based гримерку Jimmy right.</seg>
<seg id="4">Their debut album, with even a few months before its release received 100,000 предзаказов contract, and on his release lies in the portfolio мейджор-лейбла Warner Music.</seg>
<seg id="5">Given the present situation on the market, a musical плачевную from dominating the situation, because we are talking not about the new Lana del Ray, or another сладкоголосом representative of a "new R 'n' B ', but the British duo быковатых on playing with the volume and intensity of that the last time was in vogue two decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">In general, rates on the first album in connection with all вышеозначенными circumstances were especially high, and is hollow.</seg>
<seg id="7">The duo has taken his name, which previously could prejudice that isn't quite so desperate and hairy metalheads, which flows the blood of kings, how they think, they have in the veins, too.</seg>
<seg id="8">We are talking, of course, first and foremost about the heroes of the past such as Led Zeppelin, and the great quartet, Royal Blood are shaken застоявшуюся blood British rock it to a new level.</seg>
<seg id="9">To make predictions about the success of this enterprise until, perhaps, pretty early, but we can say something.</seg>
<seg id="10">A dozen songs, with a small уложившихся in thirty minutes - it's not so much a demonstration of the phenomenal композиторского gifts, and behave like a powerful declaration of intent.</seg>

<seg id="15">And this is not necessarily bad, on the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="16">The strength of the Royal Blood in the fact that they do not claim to be the idea of the new John Lennon's and McCartney (certainly more Motörhead) to mark this successors, but made numerous рок-дуэты инди-клубов from the ghetto.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their music, despite some variety, created for stadiums, indoors, apply less than a couple of thousand people, she is obviously closely.</seg>

<seg id="20">Heroes ретророка zero with great difficulty outside of postmodern mistakenly paradigm, with great reluctance, went on to admit themselves not just эпигонами and independent creative units.</seg>
<seg id="21">Royal Blood same now sound so heavily and preferred that this pressure and successfully драпирует some вторичность твердолобость musical material.</seg>

<seg id="3">The news was a surprise, not because no one expected that it would be sold, but because many expected that YouTube will be a buyer.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago, selling it for a billion Google видеосервису looked completely finished, and this combination was a natural.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was founded just three years ago, such as Justin.tv, set a goal to be streaming service is of a general nature of YouTube in real time.</seg>

<seg id="8">And the "pay for play" genre "videos, in which всезнайки give (mainly old) games, as in" Таинственном theatre ", already popular on YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="9">In fact, YouTube is mentioned often, when you describe it, so the news that YouTube acquires it was without much interest, a classic example of new technology companies, выкупающей potential competitor.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube failed, given that, reportedly, he was willing to pay not less than Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">All that we have at the moment is a statement from Shire CEO Emmett it: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term objectives, and they want to help us get there faster."</seg>
<seg id="12">Another mystery, to be honest, it is an incredible success.</seg>

<seg id="20">It had 55 million unique visitors per month, and it is the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.</seg>
<seg id="21">How Amazon works on this?</seg>
<seg id="22">It is difficult to imagine that it свернется in Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube would simply absorb it.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, it is with pleasure that would have received any company: The crowd of young men, of whom dream of advertisers.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the same time, the cost of university textbooks for many students more than $1000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move to the second course, came up with an ingenious way to reduce costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">He has developed a system that can take books from старшекурсников, offering them rated compensation that they delayed their sale.</seg>
<seg id="4">"My textbook on mathematical analysis, which typically costs $180 for the semester, I got $10 and biscuits" Chick-fil-A "," says Schroeder, 19, who studies at Ковенант College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The literature on the cost would be $430 last semester, he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He spent $120.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the Council, the average college student spends $1,200 a year on textbooks and educational, but students have a range of options to reduce these costs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas, such was the system.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rent books is becoming more and more popular, allowing students to use the book for the semester, and is often significantly cheaper than buying them.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Нибо Инкорпорейтид", which holds more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of rental books grew by half since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">Industry studies show that about a quarter of books in university book stores during the past spring semester were taken, "said vice president of Нибо" Trevor Meyer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Less than half of all books sold in university book stores, according to the National Association of the university's professional union shops. "</seg>
<seg id="13">Here's introductory course on the best ways to make a better deal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Purchase in store</seg>
<seg id="15">Sometimes, if you go to the Internet, the price for a new book could constitute one third from the one that you'll see in the university bookshop.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis," Ron Larson ’ s Bruce Edwards's and Robert Хостетлера worth about $290 privately, but a copy can be purchased for $239,99 site Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Buying подержанного</seg>
<seg id="18">If you don't mind other people's notes or injuries, second-hand textbooks is a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Mathematical analysis" sold for $93,49 подержанном form on to Chegg.com.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Кэсэдей, 25 years later, a fourth year student at the University of Бригэм Young, said that paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for the textbook used copy of "strategic decisions in the media: Understanding of the business side of the advertising business."</seg>
<seg id="21">The book sold for $48.</seg>
<seg id="22">Teachers, for instance, Ingrid Брейси, director of "without walls" College at the University of Massachusetts in Эмхерсте, offers students refine their professors, could use the previous editions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates are insignificant for classes.</seg>
<seg id="24">In such cases, the old editions can often be found in a very small fraction of the cost of the latest edition.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition to websites Amazon and Chegg, Half.com, "owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying second-hand books.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hire</seg>
<seg id="27">The textbooks to take a car, you need to think, if you're well enough with them, don't forget to return them and don't want to leave them yourself after the course is completed.</seg>
<seg id="28">You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, a student could rent a "Математический analysis" for a semester for about $20.</seg>
<seg id="30">Find out what the rules of the store, where you take books, including any fines that you can write the underscore marks, and damage.</seg>
<seg id="31">If you take a book, remember: If you don't will regain the book, fines may even exceed the cost of the new instance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Electronic books</seg>
<seg id="33">Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks is another option.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sometimes, these books can actually take purchasing electronic license for a certain period for retailers, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.</seg>
<seg id="35">Rent "Mathematical Analysis" on the Web site Chegg.com for six months will cost about $61.</seg>
<seg id="36">Брейси says that students who study literature, can often find the most advantageous prices, as many of the classics can try it free for now, while the literature on natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.</seg>
<seg id="37">No matter what, осмотритесь.</seg>
<seg id="38">Joe Who, 29, who is going to start their studies in high school, you Пеппердин recommends use ISBN numbers to find out the price of a book, as it ensures that you are looking for is required.</seg>
<seg id="39">But before you order online, "says Who, be sure to check whether a book is in stock.</seg>
<seg id="40">He Hemsedal this lesson.</seg>
<seg id="41">The book, which he bought, was postponed for four weeks, and, in the end, he paid the full price in the university bookshop.</seg>

<seg id="8">After all, if there is a policy it has to obtain a refund certificate was not without traffic.</seg>
<seg id="9">Parameters laid out in the draft guidelines, which are designed to eliminate this obstacle in the way of implementation 'европротокола "in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to them, the maximum payout has in connection with the accident, without the police, must not be lower than the limit for "европротоколу."</seg>
<seg id="11">But at the same time, it cannot be above a certain limit, the treaty has insurance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The idea, of course, useful and theoretically capable of relieving both its employees and the road.</seg>
<seg id="13">But, most likely, it didn't come in, neither elation nor insurers.</seg>
<seg id="14">The last now talk about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which could lead to the introduction of new rules on payments has.</seg>
<seg id="15">As for the drivers, it is difficult to imagine what kind of work will have to be done to overcome as a Russian conservatism.</seg>
<seg id="16">In most cases, the driver would be hours to wait for the inspectors to make small accident, because the lock.</seg>
<seg id="17">And it remains to be seen what will be easier - or to convince drivers to win swindlers in reliability "европротокола."</seg>
<seg id="18">Savings certificate will be registered and irrevocable offer</seg>
<seg id="19">The Finance Ministry wants to block savings certificates for, but will allow banks to make their analogue безотзывного contribution.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Finance Ministry is preparing a bill that would prohibit savings certificates on the bearer.</seg>
<seg id="21">In recent years, this tool is gaining popularity, as rates are higher here than on bank deposits.</seg>
<seg id="22">The fact is that savings certificates for the deposit insurance system, and the bank are cheaper because they don't have to make payments to the Fund Deposit Insurance Agency (pointed out).</seg>
<seg id="23">The situation successfully in the fact that this step will be taken because of the small and medium-sized banks, spreading such certificates, and suffer from Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which is estimated to have pointed out, the control 98 per cent of the level of the market.</seg>
<seg id="24">With the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, is about 3.5%.</seg>
<seg id="25">The problem, pointed out, the explanation lies in the fact that a small bank customers who bought such a certificate, in case of license revocation is trying to get money from him in pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates on bearer, may assume that their investment is insured.</seg>
<seg id="27">The absence of reasonable insurance payments on these certificated in case of license revocation your bank can lead to misunderstandings and social tensions.</seg>
<seg id="28">In practice, there have been cases when the agency предъявительских certificates tried to seek redress through the court, "he said in a pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="29">The problem, of course, made-up.</seg>
<seg id="30">The certificates pay buyers still nobody will, by law, because they have no right to compensation from the State.</seg>
<seg id="31">If the case was that the tool is not insured in pointed, together with him and would have banned metal accounts, which means citizens are in grams of one of the four metals: Gold, silver, platinum and palladium.</seg>
<seg id="32">Since these accounts do not fall into the deposit insurance system, but their existence as long as no one deprives.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is likely that the bearer certificates are very convenient, certifying that actually can act in the role of квазиденег.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the same time, almost all of them are out of control: The bank can buy a certificate to any citizen, and I was overjoyed that the certificate can change a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is not by chance that the draft that savings certificate must be a valuable paper, which must be stored in the depository.</seg>
<seg id="36">And one added that banks are allowed to issue such certificates without the right to early redemption.</seg>
<seg id="37">That is a similar безотзывного contribution, which has long been a dream of the bankers.</seg>

<seg id="1">Met two Union</seg>
<seg id="2">The talks at the highest level in Minsk is not decided, for the sake of whom were called back, but has also produced a new format: The first face of the European Union met with the chief executives of the Eurasian future</seg>
<seg id="3">Let drift and the situation around Ukraine very urgent about (is), the leaders of the EU and Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of "hot issues."</seg>
<seg id="4">It is capable of such a structure to work effectively, it is unclear; but it is clear who took the cream from that summit.</seg>
<seg id="5">Questions on this score fell away in the evening on August 26, when the Belarusians, and following them and other евразийцы with Europeans saw a television news report about the new President Lukashenko.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Belarusian leader revealed an example of polished talent, it was the behavior of a man who had just caught the jackpot - and is planning a decent old age in high society.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Maidan Lukashenko helped</seg>
<seg id="8">Arrival in Minsk just three main European commissioners (of EU ministers), who met with Mr. Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf -- not just легитимация president for the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is the subject of an application for recognition of a full European policy and the primary campaign of the Ukrainian crisis.</seg>
<seg id="10">A senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Studies Denis Мельянцов sure: From now on, Brussels can already speak with Minsk in the same tone as before.</seg>
<seg id="11">"What Catherine Ashton met face to face with Lukashenko, gives reason to believe that the relationship with the EU will be размораживаться and beyond," he said "Огоньку."</seg>
<seg id="12">It is a hidden part of the iceberg: Preparing to push the Belarusian authorities began long before November Maidan in Kiev - summer 2013-го.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The results have been achieved and the EU is the successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues about modernization," lists "Огонька interlocutor," and with the United States have held talks on international security.</seg>
<seg id="14">States even took a little bit of sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="15">As regards the Ukrainian events, then they and their reaction to the Belarus leadership only invoked another influx this process.</seg>
<seg id="16">Minsk, on the one hand, we have been able to maintain relations with Ukraine are warm enough, not much to lose in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for talks.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other hand, the leader of the Senate, which has not recognized the annexation of Crimea by Russia and urged to punish pro-Russian militia in the Donbas with all severity, and quarreled with Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="18">Minsk has not released any of the Customs Union, nor from the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), and sometimes it is placed in a Russian air base.</seg>
<seg id="19">Brussels and Washington have a balanced position on the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated her confident Belarusian experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">How successful will the movement's political diversification, will be seen by how often in the near future, Minsk should ever take meetings in the format of the EU + TC.</seg>
<seg id="21">The press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy Catherine Ashton and diplomacy have failed to answer questions about what Brussels expects relations in the new format.</seg>
<seg id="22">A spokesman for Ashton said only "Maya Косьянчич Огоньку" that decisions on issues of war and peace, this issue is not a priority.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the same time, there were reports that the next meeting on the Ukraine issue, with the participation of the people in the new format may be, and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="24">A drop of tar in Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that on this, as it turns out, personally asked representatives of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nevertheless, at the final briefing Alexander Lukashenko made it clear: All sides don't mind that Minsk has remained the central platform for meeting both Россия--ОБСЕ--Украина format, and at the level of Heads of State and high representatives of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="26">This means that "the last dictator in Europe" becomes a quite рукопожатного European leader who helps to solve a global problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">The European farmer's best friend</seg>
<seg id="28">Already the EU delegation included еврокомиссаров on trade and energy, pushed to the conclusion: The main reason the summit is not the tragic situation in Belarus, and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="29">In fact, сверстанное at the meeting schedule for future negotiations on the supply of gas and to overcome fear of the CU in the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the EU looks achievement more extensive than peace declaration without specific dates and numbers.</seg>
<seg id="30">Trade Commissioner Karl De Гюхт, nevertheless, identified the: EU officials "arrived in Minsk to find solution to the political crisis which has economic consequences, and not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="31">It seems, however, that the economy and the crisis in Ukraine "works" in Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its consequences - and above all reciprocal sanctions from the West and Russia, offer cut-price, who himself is under pressure, while санкционное with room for maneuver.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to the leader of the Mises Research Centre, the Belarus presidential candidate Yaroslav Ramanchuk, European investors are actively interested in Belarus for supplies of agricultural products to the Russian Federation in bypassing sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the same time, schemes are, for which President Vladimir Putin at the summit пожурил Minsk.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Initiated these schemes," said Romanchuk Огоньку "," are not the Belarusian businessmen and Russian companies.</seg>
<seg id="36">They practised for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Russian business is in desperate need of something to restore them, even through the mediation of the Belarusian authorities.</seg>
<seg id="38">The second story, "the expert continues," is linked to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not averse to establish production in Belarus of raw materials as well as focusing on the Russian market.</seg>
<seg id="39">Ukrainian producers have about 4 billion of exports to Russia, and the Belarusian производственно-торговые scheme now could be very popular. "</seg>
<seg id="40">According to Ramanchuk, the role of the host site for the negotiations between the EU and the CU is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of the development of economic ties with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="41">He recalls that the loss of the agricultural sector of the EU sanctions against Moscow are estimated at 10 billion euros, and the Commission is currently proposed аграриям only 125 million euros compensation.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Belarusian president could offer to Brussels to work together to minimise the consequences for еврофермеров.</seg>
<seg id="43">This could raise the authority of Lukashenko in the EU on the height.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hospitality without initiatives</seg>
<seg id="45">Catherine Ashton thanked the authorities for the initiative for the summit.</seg>
<seg id="46">But the paradox is that the official Minsk from his active role in the birth of the CU + EU открещивается format, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with Ukrainian counterpart emphasized that the initiator of a new format and it was.</seg>
<seg id="47">"It was your suggestion to come, without any навала discuss, not with бухты-барахты decide, after signing the Association Agreement with the EU, to sort out the situation, which at that time was in Ukraine," he said in front of cameras to Peter Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, observers interpreted it as an attempt to calm the rumours that she was originally against the intermediation of Minsk, which greatly increases his political weight.</seg>
<seg id="49">In Belarusian diplomatic establishment carefully emphasize that cooperation between the EU and Belarus in the organization for not pursuing the TC land lucrative goals, and the ultimate goal of this format in the future - the creation of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.</seg>
<seg id="50">"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts which, in other fields, in particular in the field of security, and promotes the growth of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation," the Foreign Ministry said "Огоньку Belarus, where, in the recent words were chosen very carefully.</seg>

<seg id="4">The sequel is revolutionary in its own way, too: In the sense that it erodes fundamental to modern thinking chain "thesis - either" synthesis "(if you understand as a thesis and antithesis нуара universe, the cosmos - comic books).</seg>

<seg id="6">"The city and the" грехов-2 хаотичен драматургическом, and the philosophical level, both times he was in a bad mood хаотичен sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="7">Yes, the characters are familiar for the first part of "City," although, behold, громила Марв Рурк (Mickey), I remember, had finished life to death by electric chair, and then, nothing, just to rile people up and, in the role of crushed дружинника - from the air with knives and axes удавками.</seg>

<seg id="12">It's not people, we understand that this is a fatal flaw: Archetypes нуара smoothly, too confident player, "угодивший медовую trap" sex, the corrupt detective упырь-сенатор.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin demands from Kiev to begin negotiations on the "statehood" of eastern Ukraine</seg>
<seg id="2">According to Russian news reports about his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government has stopped fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately started negotiations on the "statehood" отделившегося region.</seg>
<seg id="3">His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later made it clear that he did not have in mind the hint that восточноукраинская territory controlled by separatists will become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine, should be revised to give русскоговорящему region have to defend their rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, Mr Putin's call for the Government to start negotiations with the very insurgents as well as government-controlled with equal corresponds to the obvious strategy, which he follows from the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: To help the separatists to take back territory and force the Ukrainian government to give новопровозглашенной Новороссии of de facto independence, to closer ties with Russia rather than with the West.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview on state television channel Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return the territory retained in the eastern separatists of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, both of which were seized in March and April after the Ukrainian peninsula Crimea as Moscow be much stricter in Europe on March 18.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists recently named captured territory Новороссией, or New Russia, the name, which refers to the дореволюционным glory days of the Russian Empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin has said that anyone who believes that peace talks will occur in the near future, when the Ukrainian politicians to campaign for parliamentary elections on October 26, and while government troops attack peace settlement in detained separatists regions, "пленник illusions," Itar-Tass reported.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We must immediately begin substantive talks and not only technical issues but also on the political organization of society and the public status of Southeast Ukraine, in order to serve the interests of the people living there," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskov said that Putin's words about the state had in mind in the context of the broader autonomy that was discussed during months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to allay fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and language rights at risk.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian government could give the eastern regions autonomy, Peskov said.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and an internal Ukrainian conflict."</seg>
<seg id="12">Press secretary the Kremlin's intervention to rectify incorrect "interpretation of the words" Putin stressed the decision of the Russian leadership to behave in relation to the breakaway rebellion in the east in any other way than open the seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the population are ethnic Russians 2-миллионного.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow had to withstand much more heavy battle to attach even Donetsk and eastern Ukraine Луганскую area, since most of the 6.5 million residents are Russians, and surveys prior to the start of the conflict, showed broad support for the desire to stay within Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">Autonomy, which Russian diplomats discussed at international forums gave regional governments in the Ukraine power to trade agreements and foreign policy, in effect giving the Kremlin the actual control of the territory, which would be the core of the Russia teamed with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="15">On the Black Sea peninsula, присоединенном five months ago, is still the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial marine institutions and historical sea resorts.</seg>

<seg id="18">However, his opinion on autonomy, it seems, is very different from the view of the Kremlin and повстанцев-сепаратистов and Rogue, which accuse Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="19">Last call for Putin to Kiev to negotiate with the leaders of the separatists, as with equal, followed by new наступлениями rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks rolled into previously peaceful areas of eastern Ukraine along the Sea of Azov.</seg>
<seg id="20">Russia supported separatists took control of the city in which Новоазовск officers of the Ukrainian security services say they are afraid that he is starting a campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory to the Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="21">This led to a large-scale civilian and military efforts to strengthen steel port of Mariupol, with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Новоазовском and narrow the Crimean Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko on Saturday appealed to the European Union leaders meeting in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which was an independent 23 years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Anger turned out to be the most versatile and functional human emotion</seg>
<seg id="2">Сердитое expression is biologically universal for mankind, and everyone involved in its creation of authority and a group of muscles is significant, and is an additional means of expressing power and threat, researchers have found in Australia and the United States.</seg>
<seg id="3">About their discovery, they reported in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly about them can be found in a press release at the University of California at Santa Barbara.</seg>
<seg id="4">Гневное expression - by climbing in and running down the line of thin eyebrows, lips, and nostrils 2030 is equally in all cultures, and make it even blind from birth, children are never who saw, said study lead author Aaron Селл.</seg>
<seg id="5">As part of a major research project on the nature of the anger, the scientists found that arose this emotion for the effective conduct of disputes during the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="6">The more physical damage one man can do to another, the greater the opportunity to dictate to him, while he pleads to partner with anger.</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers have confirmed their hypothesis: Physically and other powerful people often get angry and switch to pitch invasions, consider themselves entitled to impose other disadvantageous conditions for them, and they prefer the methods of solving conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="8">Starting from that anger is a bargaining emotion "first and foremost," the scientists decided that the movement of each of the seven groups of muscles, creating сердитое expression, should be an individual гневающегося more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor, and thereby force as soon as possible to agree to its terms in order to avoid conflict.</seg>
<seg id="9">To test this hypothesis, the researchers modelled on a computer, where наличествовал or absent each of seven elements гневного faces, and showed them but.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although eyebrows or by climbing in 88-4 chin forward individually do face evil, then изображенного with such traits, physically stronger human study participants acknowledged unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="11">Anger, as well as in animals, a threat: An exaggerated manifestation of its own forces and to agree to that force.</seg>
<seg id="12">Man поджимает inflated nostrils and lips with the same purpose as a frog, which надувается or бабуин, which demonstrates their fangs.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Anger" runs "refusal to listen to the situation, and the face immediately takes the form, effectively has demonstrated the opposite side of the consequences of this failure.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the most striking is that none of the components гневного faces is not arbitrary, they are one and the same, "said anthropologist John Туби.</seg>
