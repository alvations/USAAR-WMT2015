<seg id="1">Recalling a very American ideal that labor rights are human rights</seg>
<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have offered the bill, which is protected by the unions as a civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">"There, where unions and middle-class jobs," says Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, who is co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive factions.</seg>
<seg id="4">That is why I am proud to represent the expanding the rights of workers, together with the symbol of the movement for civil rights by John Lewis.</seg>
<seg id="5">This innovative bill will give workers the same opportunities for legal discrimination against trade union organization, and other forms of discrimination, opponents of trade union power</seg>
<seg id="6">Changes in the regulation of labor relations in such a way as to allow the workers encountering discrimination for participation in trade union organizations, to seek justice in the civil courts, and compensation and punitive damages payments - a sensible and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it's certainly not radical initiative - at least by American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the best way to understand that offer Ellison, Lewis and co-authors of the bill, "recall is a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the attacks, which the unions have in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country, Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, to expand and to respect human rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time, which is still remembered by millions of Americans, when this country simultaneously defend democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas MacArthur and his assistants have helped the country to adopt a constitution, to ensure that my военизированная Хидеки Тодзё was replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included text that explicitly admitted that "the right of workers to organize, and for talks, and the collective action is guaranteed."</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Эйзенхауер and his assistants have helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that fascism was replaced by Adolf Hitler a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recognizing that workers will have to be organized and be heard in the new state, the Germans have included an article that openly stated: "The right to form associations with the aim to protect and improve employment and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict or seek to diminish that right, will have no legal force; measures for these purposes, would be recognized as illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">When former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which amounted to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, will be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the drafters have included that "everyone has the right to organize and join unions to defend their interests."</seg>
<seg id="17">Generations of Americans take for granted our basic position that labor rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country is advised by other countries about how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans have explained that the right to organize labor unions - and the fact that this union has participated as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - should be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now, when these rights are under assault in America, wisely, actually, to go back to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to make their voices heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the Reverend Martin Luther King said the younger fifty years ago:</seg>
<seg id="21">History is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now everyone knows that the trade union movement is not undermined the nation's power, but increased them.</seg>
<seg id="23">Raising the living standards of millions, unions miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to fragile level of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack the unions, forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.</seg>
<seg id="25">History remembers as we should.</seg>
<seg id="26">The official recognition of labour rights as human rights and the protection of civil rights, to prevent discrimination against the trade union organizations, was long overdue.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the U.S., a federal judge on Sunday temporarily has blocked the introduction of Louisiana law, which his supporters say he is likely to close all five абортных clinics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to this measure, which was signed by the Governor of Louisiana Bobby Джинадлом in June and was supposed to go into effect September 1, doctors who do abortions, were obliged to have powers of patients in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the judge's decision means that, at present, doctors can continue to make legal abortion, while continuing to look for such powers.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally, continuing actions to gain power," he wrote in his decision, Judge John деГрэвеллз.</seg>
<seg id="6">A hearing will be scheduled within the next month, at which a judge will take a more permanent solution on this law.</seg>
<seg id="7">Advocates for abortion rights are met the decision, the latest in a chain of decisions against similar measures, saying it will give doctors more time to receive hospital authority.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today's decision ensures that the women will be protected as the Louisiana law, which seeks to deprive them of the health and human rights," said Nancy Нортап, president and head of the Center for reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the state's five clinics.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the decision applies to doctors from two clinics, which were claimants in the case, and also filed a request for authority.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, and the courts recently acknowledged such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="11">Key parts of the law that would have closed техасского, most of the remaining clinics in this state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fighters for the right to abortion, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association say the laws impose restrictions on the credentials of doctors that are not necessary from the point of view of health.</seg>
<seg id="13">Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, though some also pointed to positive effect in the closing clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only one doctor who does abortions in Louisiana, is the authority of the hospital, said the Center for reproductive Rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all the other doctors in the state will be forced to stop performing the procedure, the doctor, fearing for their safety, would no longer perform this procedure, the group reported.</seg>
<seg id="16">Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they will not punish doctors doing abortions as long as their statements on the power of waiting for solutions.</seg>

<seg id="1">The result of the introduction of quotas for domestic products</seg>
<seg id="2">Not less than half of products for each type of product in the range trading networks are to be believed, production of the Russian State Duma deputy from Just Russia, Oleg Nilov has informed.</seg>
<seg id="3">The MP has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures for domestic manufacturers, writes the newspaper Izvestia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The document will still some points, in order to avoid possible discomfort for the buyers.</seg>
<seg id="5">This applies to goods that are not produced in Russia. <... > According to the rest of the groups of products, which are produced in Russia, would provide the at least half of the production of their domestic producers, "Nilov has informed.</seg>
<seg id="6">Together with the amendments to Article of trading activities in the Russian Federation, "the bill provides for the introduction of changes to the Tax Code, laying down a 10% rate of VAT in Norway of the product produced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea to introduce a 50% quota in municipal -процентную is included in the stimulus package for Russian producers.</seg>
<seg id="8">The shop appears several times more than domestic goods.</seg>
<seg id="9">But the initiative could have both a positive and a negative effect, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="10">Attorney Налоговик ", a member of the independent centre of expertise" Public Duma Sergei Litvinenko for the Russian economy, as well as for domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive in nature, and will lead to growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">These are good points will prove key, farmers, small shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">They will be able to sell more, and that means that profits will grow.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, they will receive the right to dictate their terms to retailers and prices, because they will be forced to buy their goods.</seg>
<seg id="14">Russian manufacturers will be able to increase the volume of its sales activities and that will lead to pay higher taxes than before.</seg>
<seg id="15">This will increase budget revenues, will create new jobs, industries will grow any faster would be осваиваться contribution to GDP growth.</seg>
<seg id="16">Russia's dependence on foreign food to fall a few times, but not immediately, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="17">Earlier, Russian companies are often unable to fight their way to the shelves of local stores due to higher competition from foreign counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche gained freedom and can breathe a sigh of relief.</seg>
<seg id="19">But do not forget that, after all the necessary approvals and sanitary inspections on the Russian market are food from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="20">In other words, it is now a "quiet moment" when the players have already left, and new ones not yet come.</seg>
<seg id="21">Almost a month later, we can say the demand for Russian raw materials, as well as rising prices for finished products, "said the first all-Russian АиФ.ru Vice President" Russian club financial directors, "Tamara Kasyanov.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clearly, the idea of selling in each category at least 50% of the Russian food products will allow us to consolidate the sector for local producers.</seg>
<seg id="23">In that case, they will have to compete with one another, not with products that subsidies at the expense of another state, are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="24">In other words, the fight for the buyer will unfold between the companies working on one of the industry.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, says Kasyanov, Russian producers are able to meet 50% of domestic needs compatriots not on all items.</seg>
<seg id="26">And in this situation commercial networks will have "дотягивать" share of Russian goods up to half of the range.</seg>
<seg id="27">In this regard, increasing fears that the store will come forward.</seg>
<seg id="28">Perhaps under the guise of manufactured in Russia, will be delivered to foreign products with перебитыми labels, "adds an expert.</seg>
<seg id="29">The negative effect of the introduction of quotas are large trading networks, especially those which выгодней cooperate with importers.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is logical that the prime minister will suffer and foreign suppliers, because the demand for their products will decrease.</seg>
<seg id="31">Litvinenko did not rule out that the law on quotas on domestic goods may impact on consumers.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fact is that some of the Russian-made products can yield quality imported ones, while shops will be ambassadors in the second, both on a scarce commodity.</seg>
<seg id="33">The revolutions in the early 2000s, import substitution idea economists have started talking again in February this year because of the ongoing devaluation of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="34">Now, against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the question of the import of products becomes even more urgent.</seg>
<seg id="35">The law aims to compel retailers under orders to suppliers to domestic producers.</seg>
<seg id="36">Then we are much faster and more confident we will go on the path of import substitution, and the planning system needed for the production of products will be created in a shorter period of time, "says the MP Oleg Nilov has informed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Especially effective mechanism will introduce quotas for those agricultural sectors, where the potential is especially high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.</seg>
<seg id="38">Our farmers are able to fully cover the shelves in Russian shops.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition, a powerful impulse, may get cold and production.</seg>

<seg id="1">Inflation came out of the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="2">Whether the Russians will feel a sharp price rise</seg>
<seg id="3">As a result of the November 1998, Russian sanctions and inflation in Russia and the West will not уложится in forecasts, analysts believe, "VTB Capital."</seg>
<seg id="4">According to experts, the deferred effects антисанкций will lead to inflationary ever in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the latest forecast, the Ministry of Economic Development in 2014, inflation will be 6,5-7,5% the following year - less than the 6.5 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to the newspaper, "Kommersant," the commentary this week should make "small adjustments", but the principal in macroeconomic forecast up to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the publication, the agency ’ s assessment of inflation in 2015, which will eliminate обнуление expected revenue growth of the population.</seg>
<seg id="8">The forecast, it was assumed that the Russian food sanctions apply a year - until August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">In such a situation, you could assume such high inflation?</seg>
<seg id="10">The current situation is during the shock, but понижательный trend of inflation will not change, "said a source in the newspapers so far.</seg>
<seg id="11">Economists from VTB Capital "is not shared by the bloc's financial and economic expectations about inflation and the forecast price growth in 2014, at the level of 8%.</seg>
<seg id="12">The main effect of product bans will come together with the possible introduction of a tax on sales in regions of the Russian Federation (GAP) in 2015, the experts are convinced.</seg>
<seg id="13">Inflationary spike in 9% in February, after which the annual pace of price growth will go into recession, some experts believe.</seg>
<seg id="14">By the way, last week Rosstat let the first inflation results, after Russia imposed sanctions "neat".</seg>
<seg id="15">АиФ.ru interviewed experts and found their expectations of future inflation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Artem Деев, head of research at FC AForex:</seg>
<seg id="17">Already there has been a rise in prices for the main segments of goods.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moreover, when I began to appreciate the socially significant products, the government was forced to launch measures of monitoring systemic risks to price stability, in order to prevent unreasonable price increases in the short term.</seg>
<seg id="19">Suppliers and retailers already report on a daily basis before regulators that authorities knew exactly who, where and for what reason will trigger an increase in prices.</seg>
<seg id="20">Key factors for the growth of the consumer price index continues to be tremendous pace of capital flight, excessive refinancing the banking sector from the Russian мегарегулятора, convert the internal flight due to population in foreign currency, as well as an embargo on the import of food from countries that joined the sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="21">If inflationary pressures remained under control, the cost of a minimum basket of products not would have jumped by 12% in only one quarter.</seg>
<seg id="22">A ban on the import of food products provoked shock proposals on the internal market and led to a higher cost of логичному.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because at this stage we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, and increase the size of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production, a response to the inflationary risks sanctions will continue the growth component.</seg>
<seg id="24">If you include another and fiscal reasons related to the lack of credibility of the national currency, as well as ухудшенными prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year, inflation could exceed 8%.</seg>
<seg id="25">Alexander Разуваев, director of the analytical department "Альпари"</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 1990s, inflation sometimes hit 20-30% per month to zero, it was also higher than the current level, another thing that then it is offset by rapid economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="27">I think, at the end of the year inflation will be 8-8,5%.</seg>
<seg id="28">Plato Магута, managing assets of the Criminal Code, "the Fund Магута"</seg>
<seg id="29">An external factor associated with sanctions against Russia, while successfully contained, but if there is a further increase of the pressure, first of all, the financial sector - this can lead to a certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations of the population, who are traditionally in purchases of currency to protect their savings.</seg>
<seg id="30">It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance will try to smooth the weakening rouble, as market practices and government regulation.</seg>
<seg id="31">But prices traditionally begins after the summer lull, and perhaps this fall will become more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="32">The target level of consumer inflation in Russia, 7.5%, most likely, because Russian выстоит has another dividend.</seg>

<seg id="15">"As far as the proposed settlement on the constructive elements, but in practice this is implementable, because the building has often used a completely different technology," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is no secret that, thanks largely to the госзаказу стройрынок develops.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the Chairman of the Board of Medicine "Экспертное Community procurement professionals" Catherine Лезиной, today the state is the most effective customer.</seg>
<seg id="18">Deputy director of industry in Latvia's capital construction Vladimir Malakhov Rosatom drew attention to the fact that the market can be divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and the company that owns монопольными competence and does not allow for this field of competitors.</seg>
<seg id="19">He believes that the creation of a transparent market is only possible when access to contracts, as Turkey is ready to be a manager of someone's impact.</seg>
<seg id="20">Experts on the council was asked to create a system of procurement in such a way that one and the same performer may not receive more than one contract worth more than $1 billion or more contracts worth more than $1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="21">In минстрое believe that this approach must be evaluated from the point of view of the business impact, and effectiveness of construction management.</seg>
<seg id="22">As explained by Elena Zhukova, in this case, you must be given support functions, which will lead to an increase of the budget and spending on its content.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the same time, specialists will have the knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by contractors, as well as their safety.</seg>
<seg id="24">Often when such voters will need to determine who will be responsible for the security of an object as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of highly skilled participants in connection with the state in obtaining state indeed for part-time work and a small amount of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="26">The deputy head of the Institute of procurement экспертно-консультационного Евсташенков Alexander believes that now the procedure for procurement has become a business of the game as good as they possibly can.</seg>
<seg id="27">And this example: "When filling out the application must indicate" specific performance "without the words" or equivalent "," should "," "," "more," "less than," "similar" "or" "," ",", "not the same type of" lower, "" lower, "" higher, "" can, "" may, "" might, "" earlier "and" no earlier ", not" higher, "" not allowed "and so on.</seg>
<seg id="28">Thus, customers often abused their right to establish requirements for the content of applications of contractors.</seg>
<seg id="29">Another problem, according to 44-ФЗ Евсташенкова, was the need to assess the application of the quality of the "paper" proposal.</seg>
<seg id="30">Considering the application, you can really only assess a qualified contractor, but not the quality of the work, in which not even began, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="31">The quality of the works can be assessed only on their acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="32">The experts also were asked to move a margin on income from the top to the lower echelon to intermediate contractors disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="33">The chairman of the expert committee, State Secretary, espionage FAS Andrei Цариковский believes that it should not, as responsible for the order should генподрядчик.</seg>
<seg id="34">But otherwise, as in the famous репризе of Arkady Raikin normalises sleeping: "Пуговицам claims to have?"</seg>

<seg id="3">The home of the 18th century, since the building has not changed, if not considered ветхость.</seg>
<seg id="4">People here go, on excursion, and residents are more than delighted, from his privilege - the right to live in the house, the walls of which took place at Ufa recall leader Alexander Suvorov.</seg>
<seg id="5">The date of construction of the house, amongst others, historians point to the two dates - 1730 and 1737.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in any case, it turns out that the nearly 300 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The old yard, always open the door, squeaky staircase.</seg>
<seg id="8">Doors in the apartments are located near each other, the chair covers were cracked and peeling plaster просветы places visible from the street.</seg>
<seg id="9">It seems that everything rests on honest word.</seg>
<seg id="10">But local residents are told: "You don't think it is."</seg>
<seg id="11">To live in a wooden house of the 18th century, it is very difficult, "says Tatiana (1961, a resident of apartment # 3.</seg>
<seg id="12">The object is to госохране, but its content has not allocated the money for dozens of years, and we feel museum exhibits, about which the authorities simply have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">The last renovation was 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The walls still худо-бедно stay, but the foundation of the entire прогнил.</seg>
<seg id="15">Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, and моются once a week in a public bath.</seg>
<seg id="16">How can you be content in such conditions?</seg>
<seg id="17">The road passes directly under the windows, even a pedestrian zone.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tatiana curtain will put off.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now see what before was only heard the windows: A car rushes.</seg>
<seg id="20">You see, glass дребезжат constantly, we can't open the windows, and get used to the noise.</seg>
<seg id="21">A man gets used to the same, for good and bad.</seg>
<seg id="22">Our apartment is still a top, thanks to her husband, he has golden hands.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, we have two rooms, three of them live with her son.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for other families, the conditions are much worse on the second floor ceiling in a little more than one and a half metres tall.</seg>
<seg id="25">In contrast to Tatiana offers guests the roommate out of the apartment, No. 6 Старостиной Lyudmila.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nice friendly woman with threshold offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile said:</seg>
<seg id="27">We have a one-bedroom apartment, 14.5 m ² for four people, and we live with her husband and daughter with his granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="28">I am here with the birth, another worker was not never, "Lyudmila обводит eyes room Procedural Issues: Two sofa the letter" g "; one of them was granddaughter with laptop.</seg>
<seg id="29">Very closely and differs little from a domestic interior, ceilings, beautiful "historic."</seg>
<seg id="30">But with the ceiling regularly flows: Tap system worn.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lyudmila said about his apartment and at the same time, simply as competitiveness, the house which stands on the Roman ruins.</seg>
<seg id="32">That is the one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:</seg>
<seg id="33">We spent about 40 years ago during the last repair.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the same time, we have a tiny kitchen and bathroom in закутке from former чулана.</seg>
<seg id="35">We live in a time where квартировал Demidov family, lived on the second floor of the servants.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our apartment is privatized, and why?</seg>
<seg id="37">So they say in the real estate, the privatization of meaning.</seg>
<seg id="38">Still get only a one-bedroom apartment can't qualify for more.</seg>
<seg id="39">Already four months ago promised us расселить, but promises it won't matter.</seg>
<seg id="40">Not used to complain and I will not.</seg>
<seg id="41">In this apartment (room!) lived for an entire dynasty: My grandparents, my mom and dad, I'm with my husband and my daughter with his granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="42">Things happened during that time.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, здоровенные rats ran for the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="44">Look at the walls of the outhouses, they one-meter wide thickness.</seg>
<seg id="45">They say the solution was involved in eggs, however long it lasts.</seg>
<seg id="46">The house built thoroughly Демидовым, thank you!</seg>
<seg id="47">Perhaps, but so far no one killed a crumbling battlement сваей or ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="48">Only building still slowly dying in front of us: Boards and log house гниют, floors have repeatedly failed, pouring cement, but all to no avail, "the solution is in the ground, as well.</seg>
<seg id="49">They say and have, under our room the concealed лаз and move to the river White, who had once lived here, the old Believers to hide from danger, in which case.</seg>
<seg id="50">They also pursued.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lyudmila Stomatuk says, it came as a historian, he begged, he started to wield the excavations.</seg>
<seg id="52">And then urged to give them housing space in exchange for its однушку in October.</seg>
<seg id="53">Lyudmila historian refused:</seg>
<seg id="54">Where are we over the однушку?</seg>
<seg id="55">But here at least a tiny hope is that will give housing there.</seg>
<seg id="56">We agree on the exchange, would not have won.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, the family Старостиных nothing won.</seg>
<seg id="58">The biggest dream Ludmila, Suburban Region, and one 16-year-old daughter gave his granddaughter from a separate room.</seg>
<seg id="59">That is the family's two-room apartment instead of the two are not the most majestic ruins, in which two generations living now.</seg>
<seg id="60">Pretty girl, Olesya миниатюрная Карсакова apartments from No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.</seg>
<seg id="61">There squeezed in two cramped area of 23 m ², called George, who lives with her large family.</seg>
<seg id="62">We just seven people, two children.</seg>
<seg id="63">See for yourself, what conditions.</seg>
<seg id="64">Azerbaijan, like pieces of plaster and window frames, the walls in the kitchen, and the cross-cutting holes.</seg>
<seg id="65">The water in the кране only cold all year.</seg>
<seg id="66">Walking about the apartments at the old house, so you can make sure that the most fortunate of spouses Lavrentyev apartment No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="67">They are the most spacious rooms of the first floor.</seg>
<seg id="68">You are right, a lot of places.</seg>
<seg id="69">The 75 square, directed three people.</seg>
<seg id="70">We live in those rooms, where legend has it stopped police during his stay in Ukraine, "said the head of the family of Aleksandr Dmitrievich Lavrentyev.</seg>
<seg id="71">High ceilings, spacious.</seg>
<seg id="72">One bad - all around the train wreck, falling apart, collapsing.</seg>
<seg id="73">Neighbors probably already told.</seg>
<seg id="74">The more suffering we have with floors, wooden planks сгнили, literally the land go out from under your feet.</seg>
<seg id="75">I put подпорки, wedges; in another, while in another room, walk on a seesaw качаемся, so all you can.</seg>
<seg id="76">The merchant's house Евдокима Демидова Aleksandr Dmitrievich can tell you better than any guide.</seg>
<seg id="77">The золотопромышленнику refers to the native, speaks of it with admiration.</seg>
<seg id="78">Indeed, the personality and the owner was fantastic: Кагинского Узянского plants built houses, отливал guns and bells, kept Ural mines.</seg>
<seg id="79">Merchants take pride in an ancestor of real estate heirs, but live under one roof with history no longer want.</seg>
<seg id="80">I am settled here, even as a child, in the 1940s, of the 20th century, "said Aleksandr Dmitrievich.</seg>
<seg id="81">Then stood around the stables and wooden sentry, and subsequently снесенные.</seg>
<seg id="82">In 1968, and wanted to clean our house, but something prevented.</seg>
<seg id="83">Later in 2014: Again поманили new housing.</seg>
<seg id="84">We, as a team, and gathered all the necessary documents, обегали, and suddenly learned that moving to an apartment in 2015 or 2016.</seg>
<seg id="85">Something already doesn't believe in all this....</seg>
<seg id="86">Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan, to learn the fate of homes.</seg>
<seg id="87">The occupier was not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="88">Sent from one desk to another, but then, as mockery, issued without a signature piece of paper and printing: "The Ministry of Culture did not oppose the resettlement of its residents."</seg>
<seg id="89">Even I have a feeling that our house is not in terms of the city since he first was at number 57, then became 57 A, now 57 / 1.</seg>
<seg id="90">As if he had already been demolished in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="91">"Planet" to head the Russian sector of the nomenclature of the land so Барабашу Vladimir.</seg>
<seg id="92">A house on the street of the October Revolution, 57 / 1 is included in the program of settling the old housing.</seg>
<seg id="93">I can't be responsible for the actions of officials of the 1970s, only know that at the time there was a plan for the demolition of old buildings, despite the historical significance.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the authorities is to rebuild the old house on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value, "successfully.</seg>
<seg id="95">Tenants in the planned new расселить apartments.</seg>
<seg id="96">According to Барабаша, restore Демидова House will be Italian experts who were involved in the restoration of buildings in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="97">Now Italy is architectural, and project "Old Ufa is there" among others.</seg>
<seg id="98">I hope that, by 2016, the former Old Street will be on best Western Hotel Tigra was renovated, "said the official.</seg>
<seg id="99">The house will order, that was before, three centuries ago.</seg>
<seg id="100">Демидова house, is likely to become a museum, open to all comers.</seg>
<seg id="101">In addition, the government decided to make pedestrian street at the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="102">On weekdays, unfortunately, don't get too much workload of roads in the city.</seg>
<seg id="103">People from the future museum расселить Vladimir Barabas promises in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="104">However, it is unlikely they will be pleased with their new apartments will be of the same area, and the current.</seg>

<seg id="2">Never say, "I love you"</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was one of seven children born to a family of immigrants from Jamaica in Dudley in is in 1958.</seg>
<seg id="4">His father, who died when Henry was 19, he worked in a factory, and their relationships were limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry репетирует comedy, "Rare ’ records," which is partially based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of programmes on Radio 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mix of 199.4 and rap, and melodies - жизнерадостны.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Henry had to wading through some difficult memories of childhood.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the death of his mother was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often mused about the relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was very inaccessible.</seg>
<seg id="10">You never saw his face, you only hear his voice: "Don't make noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Отстань from sisters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Шевелись!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch the cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were older, when I was a child, walked with him in the pub and talk about these things, as a form of beer glasses, the beauty of the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">I have not talked to him since.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was so неулыбчивым guy in the corner, reading a newspaper which is a big part of my life.</seg>
<seg id="17">Henry recently opened the studio are in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in the days of his father, he was able to look at what must have been his life.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now there's a little bit better, but it is deep, dark, дымные labyrinths' full extent Hell with outbreaks of fire and smoke and a lot of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father залезал in a bathtub and just lay there, and you have heard, as he slowly begins to sing about himself, because he wanted the отмыться mould from the studio.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I came in there, I knew that he was doing it years and years to make us, as ever, and I began to appreciate it more.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, Henry came from a childhood devoid of parental love.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never hugged, never say, "I love you."</seg>
<seg id="23">Only when her mother became ill at the end of her life, we started to talk: "I love you, I love you, I love you.</seg>
<seg id="24">The birth of her own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love that he lacked as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">You can stop it, "I love you"?</seg>
<seg id="26">Just don't hug me.</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I'm 22!</seg>
<seg id="28">With Don French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why would I not be friends with her?</seg>
<seg id="30">She's a great mother</seg>
<seg id="31">They are still great friends with the French, to whom he was married for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="32">Don is a good man.</seg>
<seg id="33">Why would I not be friends with Don?</seg>
<seg id="34">She's a great mom.</seg>
<seg id="35">Henry was the mother of the diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="36">He was the one that killed her.</seg>
<seg id="37">So, when I was very, very recovered and I had symptoms of diabetes, and my doctor said, "You have to take radical measures.</seg>
<seg id="38">Then I began serious training фитенсом, and I also had to sit down on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It's very hard.</seg>
<seg id="40">And it's boring.</seg>
<seg id="41">No one eats carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">A change of career trajectories of Henry reflected, perhaps, in his noble, briefly подстриженной beard.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he received the recognition for his critics of Othello, he completely immersed in theatre.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Mistakes" Комедия followed, and then "Заборы Огаста Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="45">This work is different from sitcoms and comedies that were неотъемлимым attribute his busy professional life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He began his career, when he was 16 and worked in a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">DJ noticed, as he is a parody on the stage, and wrote about it in "The new faces."</seg>
<seg id="48">His career in television began in the mid seventies: "Quite a long time I was the only black пародистом / first on television."</seg>
<seg id="49">He learned on the job.</seg>
<seg id="50">I not only had to grow in the eyes of the public, I had to learn how to be an effective vehicle for delivering jokes between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working in television, and it was very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny in "New faces" in 1975</seg>
<seg id="52">As his manager had the right to "Black and White" show minstrels, light entertainment program, in which people "чернили themselves face," Henry found that stands in for five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">My family is a very disliked.</seg>
<seg id="54">I, like, hopefully, this will never be with me, but I don't regret doing it.</seg>
<seg id="55">Though it was a strange position, worthy of condemnation, I worked on large venues and learned to work with a crowd.</seg>
<seg id="56">But then, that was easy, "which received the awards for British television classics for years and years," and it was "a grotesque parody of black people."</seg>

<seg id="58">The first season of "Show Lenny Henry" was broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as, among other things, the chef of the comedy series "Гэрет Блэклок Шеф!."</seg>
<seg id="59">Commercials, documentaries, television series and roles in films took the following ten years of his life, but, after his TV series on the BBC in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "what are you going to do next, Len, because it seems to me that you're тянешь time or сворачиваешь quietly to the side."</seg>
<seg id="60">Next was a series of programmes on Radio 4 called "What's good in...?"</seg>
<seg id="61">The first was about Шекспире.</seg>
<seg id="62">I was a genuine allergy to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">That is not to say that I've taught this at school, and I thought that this is, in many ways, a prerogative of white middle class people with колготками and cabbage at the bottom of the front.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I am very afraid of him.</seg>
<seg id="65">Everything, from whom we took an interview for transmission, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Денч said: "You have to try.</seg>
<seg id="66">Not ругай it, until you know what you are talking about.</seg>
<seg id="67">Произнеси aloud some of those words, and you will understand why we are all so fond of Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry read 20 rows to the last monologue from Othello, and his зацепило.</seg>

<seg id="71">"That's what it is, this is a serious case, Treat seriously, spacious, its text, make a small study.</seg>
<seg id="72">So, the process of rehearsal was tough, and I read this play for months and months before we got her.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">It seemed that they had been waiting for disaster, but it has not happened.</seg>
<seg id="75">Soon we began Комедию "mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I was at the National Theatre, and I just could not believe it until the end.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you have changed."</seg>
<seg id="78">A technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the audience.</seg>
<seg id="79">"The Pacific voice inside me said:" You have to work 10 minutes until they are a "operations."</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead, the assistant director, announced that view will resume as soon as the problem will be solved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I walked away from the scene and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."</seg>
<seg id="82">It's not my responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can't let someone else deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="84">"You play to play, stay in the role."</seg>
<seg id="85">In "Henry in the theater Дачесс заборах"</seg>

<seg id="92">I love to be in репетиционном hall.</seg>
<seg id="93">By the way, Henry still thinking comedian - all the way our conversation перебивают flashes of his humour, but when he starts, it finishes to parody.</seg>
<seg id="94">I just decided not to work in стендапе, because this thing with instant gratification from a room full of strangers, I think, quite dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="95">If you want to do all the time, this can lead to a standstill.</seg>
<seg id="96">I sometimes work in "Прямом broadcast in Apollo, when I want, but, in the main, I don't get as much pleasure as before.</seg>
<seg id="97">I ask, would he give стендапа tour ever.</seg>

<seg id="99">This is his new incarnation?</seg>
<seg id="100">I think so.</seg>
<seg id="101">I like to be an actor.</seg>

<seg id="40">But at least he did not have to speak Эйлинн that Фэтс Уоллер was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">Given her age, she hardly remembered a time when popular singers were compelling.</seg>

<seg id="89">He was sorry her and because of the excessive brutality of his words, and because of fear, who appeared in her eyes when she gave him.</seg>
<seg id="90">Whether she thought that he hit her?</seg>
<seg id="91">She has not talked to him about life in the cold of the northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that, in basic terms, it was like a здешнюю.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same huge icy ocean struck on both of them.</seg>
<seg id="93">American pilots could reflect the same with men, even more sensitive and capricious after IS THAT happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened than their ancestors, smugglers and разрушители, shopped in fury from pub to pub, ready to raise a hand on any woman, or to deny them their посмевшую поддразнить.</seg>
<seg id="94">Amounts to pointless head?</seg>
<seg id="95">They would have shown her a fist, if she was not cautious.</seg>
<seg id="96">Would be first kissed, kiss now became the most common erotic expression of irritation between a man and a woman; an antidote to the fresh ballads, too, which provide proper console - first kiss her, and then hit.</seg>
<seg id="97">Excessive clarification, according to Кеверна because the kiss itself was already DVD films.</seg>
<seg id="98">Эйлинн Соломонз case showed that he needed to leave.</seg>
<seg id="99">He rose from the lounger, as an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She herself felt the lead weight, but the weight of his grief surprised her.</seg>
<seg id="101">It was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They barely knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">She looked, as he goes, and I looked out of the window, as he was leaving, her companion, the man himself, the rigors of взваливший.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam, the garden, she thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">She felt a stab of sympathy towards him and men in general, even though some of them and raised her hand.</seg>
<seg id="106">The man, from the pulpit, отвернувшийся back пристыженный сраженный, the ability to fight left him - why she felt she knew so well, if she could not recall a single case, until today, when she would have seen this?</seg>
<seg id="107">Again one Эйлинн Соломонз looked at their feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">For twenty years before the events described above or so Esme cantered Нуссбаум, intelligent and energetic 32-летняя исследовательница, which worked in "Офнау," an informal service that control mood, has prepared a report on the low and medium levels of violence in those parts of the country, where it was expected that it will be reduced, if not over entirely, given the means and the forces that were allocated to its eradication.</seg>
<seg id="109">"A lot has been done, and a lot is being done," she wrote, "in order to mitigate an aggressiveness of people who fought in a war and won most of them, especially among these спутанных branches and narrow расселин area, where, despite hovering over изгородями spires of churches, gentle breath of human kindness was rarely in history.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, some quality, it turns out, неискоренимы.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher, it would seem, the низменнее those passions that he зарождает.</seg>
<seg id="112">People shed tears over his sentimental stories about drinking, skipping преодоленных obstacles and announces its overheated faith in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness retains its firm grip as in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is evidence that a new depth and vile задиристость in homes, in the workplace, on roads and even in playgrounds.</seg>
<seg id="113">"You have досадная habit of writing too much," said her supervisor, having read the report as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="114">I think you should read shorter novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">Esme cantered Нуссбаум lowered her head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask you: You атеистка?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I think that is not obliged to answer," said Esme cantered Нуссбаум.</seg>
<seg id="118">Are you a lesbian?</seg>
<seg id="119">Esme cantered again insisted on his right to privacy and silence.</seg>
<seg id="120">A feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Again silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I ask," said Luther Рабиновиц, "not because I am against atheism, лесбийства or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">Here we have no prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="124">We are the servants of society without prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="125">But some kinds of hypersensitivity, absolutely reasonable and a good in themselves, they may sometimes distort the results, such as those that you have shown me.</seg>
<seg id="126">It is obvious that you предубеждены against the church, and what you call "malevolent" and "rude", others would be interpreted as an expression of natural and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="127">Continue нудеть about THAT happened, IF ANY ВООБЩЕ happened, as if it had happened, if at all, has happened yesterday, it means depriving the country needed her life force.</seg>
<seg id="128">Esme cantered Нуссбаум огляделась laterally while Рабиновиц said.</seg>
<seg id="129">In his head, like a pink letters have led repeated advice that "Офнау" gave the country the last quarter of a century or more.</seg>
<seg id="130">Улыбайся his neighbour, value of his spouse, listen to ballads, we walk, talk on the phone, talk, listen, this fairytale city, соглашайся, извиняйся.</seg>
<seg id="131">The conversation is better than silence, word of the song better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I fully understand that you want to say," said Esme cantered Нуссбаум quietly, when satisfied that her supervisor had finished talking, "and I don't want to say anything, except that he was not as effective as we convince ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">My concern is that if we do not, we will find that repeat mistakes that initially led to ТОМУ ВООБЩЕ IF THAT happened, happened.</seg>
<seg id="134">Only this time we выбросим their anger and distrust, not on the other.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Рабиновиц joined the tips of fingers in the sitting.</seg>
<seg id="136">That gesture was supposed to mean an infinite patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"You go too far," he said, "calling" mistakes "actions that made or not made our grandfathers.</seg>
<seg id="138">You go too far and when talking about what they threw away their "anger" and "mistrust" of the "other."</seg>
<seg id="139">In your place, people should not need always to remind that the understanding of the past, that is currently defending, we're not talking about "us" and "them."</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "us" and no "other."</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of turmoil - that's all we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"For which, to be honest with ourselves," ventured into Esme cantered, "or one part of society may well justify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am not accusing anyone.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it was good or bad, what is done is done.</seg>
<seg id="145">Then it was back then.</seg>
<seg id="146">No need to say anything more - here we agree.</seg>
<seg id="147">And how not to blame anybody, we should not make excuses and, if that was appropriate, or if there was something you can fix.</seg>
<seg id="148">But why, if not to learn "</seg>
<seg id="149">Past существет in order that we have forgotten it.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I can add to that one word -</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther's Great Pyramid Рабиновица fallen apart.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I'll review your report", he said, by letting go of her.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, on the way to work, which left her knocked мотоциклист, the sidewalk, passersby, described as "a vicious rage."</seg>

<seg id="2">Growth in the eurozone slowed to the lowest in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.</seg>
<seg id="3">The business index (PMI) for the eurozone manufacturing sector of the public fell to 50.7 in August, dropping from 51.8 in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">The above 50 indicates growth.</seg>
<seg id="5">New orders and businesses suffered, among them the growing tension between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The meeting came before the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Markets will wait for a clear plan on how to deal with the eurozone ’ s recovery, as well as the threat of deflation, with inflation of just 0.3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi later this week may give further signals that he is considering a scheme of quantitative easing in the eurozone, similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Although some growth is better than no growth, and the braking effect of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers becomes more obvious," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at public.</seg>
<seg id="10">The manufacturing sector PMI in Germany, a major trade partner of Russia in the EU, has fallen to its lowest point in 11 months of 51.4.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the meantime, the bloc's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to an additional 46.9.</seg>

<seg id="13">Signs that growth momentum faded mainly industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also adds to confidence, "said Mr Dobson.</seg>
<seg id="14">The industry, most likely another would add fuel to the fire, analysts anticipating the introduction of additional monetary or tax-based incentives.</seg>
<seg id="15">One positive was news from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.</seg>
<seg id="16">Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that can be said about the August survey index of business activity in the eurozone manufacturing sector, is that it shows that the sector is still growing."</seg>
<seg id="17">He added: "Eurozone manufacturers, obviously, are finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension - particularly associated with the Russia / Ukraine, adds uncertainty still difficult conditions in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">This increasing tension, apparently hit by business - and especially the confidence of consumers, and is likely to lead to the fact that some orders are delayed, or even cancelled, especially large orders.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said that "more and more it looks like" that the ECB, in the end, of course, will have to conduct some kind of quantitative easing, "although we suspect that it will be limited."</seg>

<seg id="79">And I can't stop feeling it.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.</seg>
<seg id="81">Damir grew up and became very soft and quiet as a boy, he's not an aggressive and angry.</seg>
<seg id="82">He is not looking for revenge, for example, he did not just fixed on it in this last nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not like to remember it, but they are very close with six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and burn candles there.</seg>

<seg id="85">Not slept, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I also remember how he threw all their weapons and other military toys. Дамиру now 17, he was above me, nice, smart and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that a few hours I was so sure that he is dead and that I never see him no more.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I was able to recover from the explosion and rose to his feet, I огляделась, I saw hell around himself, when parts of bodies were lying everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely convinced that it is not possible to my little boy could survive in this hell.</seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember what I shouted to him:" Run, Damir, one ", but again I was so sure that he had not heard me.</seg>
<seg id="91">But he heard, and ran off.</seg>

<seg id="103">There is not a single day when we won't remember this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="104">We do not think that it was a long time ago, I think it was yesterday, some scenes all the time these days I have before your eyes.</seg>

<seg id="111">I understand, but I also think that the photos of people from all over the world are feeling the pain.</seg>
<seg id="112">George says now: "It is important that this never happened.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I doubt we will ever learn the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">People continue to investigate this tragedy and will never know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">Now they are investigating the collapse of some in the Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Will we ever know what it was?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world is going to something very bad.</seg>
<seg id="118">"I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, because it is happening?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing in such pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need to have a little bit of tens of years to forget her.</seg>
<seg id="121">It has affected my health, and I still feel it.</seg>
<seg id="122">About three or four years of nightmares because of me, but now it became better.</seg>
<seg id="123">I returned to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.</seg>
<seg id="124">I thought about my friends and одноклассниках who have been killed.</seg>
<seg id="125">That's why I continue to walk in the gym before every September 1.</seg>
<seg id="126">I want to pay tribute to the memory of my old childhood friends.</seg>
<seg id="127">I find it difficult to enter the gym, but I must do this.</seg>

<seg id="137">The boy, who survived, despite the fact that he was at the feet of террориста-убийцы</seg>
<seg id="138">Incredible: George Фарниев was at the feet of террориста-убийцы during capture, but it managed to survive</seg>
<seg id="139">During the seizure, however in the gym he was sitting next to a bomb at the feet of террориста-убийцы.</seg>
<seg id="140">Indeed, it is a miracle that he was not killed.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It seems to us that it was yesterday," says Giorgi, who wanted to learn the intelligence officer in the Federal Security Service (FSB), but couldn't because of the damage that was caused by his health at the time of capture.</seg>
<seg id="142">It's still with me, this is not something that I left behind.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am older now, and they say that children can easily cope with bad events, I must say that this is not true.</seg>
<seg id="144">"In 2006 I worked with psychologists, and I felt a bit better after that, but I can't forget it.</seg>
<seg id="145">And I would like to forget.</seg>
<seg id="146">In 2005, the following year - was the first and last time, when I went to the gym again.</seg>
<seg id="147">I lost consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="148">I would never go there again, and, please, don't ask me to show where I was sitting in that famous photo.</seg>
<seg id="149">Alive: George Фарниев today with an open laptop on a photograph of himself in a hospital after seizure</seg>
<seg id="150">My pain is enormous, and I carry it with you every day.</seg>
<seg id="151">My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me about my school.</seg>
<seg id="152">With regard to the physical condition, and I'm healthy.</seg>
<seg id="153">I need to be cautious with the knee, which was damaged, but now I go okay.</seg>
<seg id="154">But health is not allowed me to go to study at the Academy of the Federal Security Service in St Petersburg, as I wanted to.</seg>
<seg id="155">I sent my documents, including medical reports, and they replied that this is impossible.</seg>
<seg id="156">My second passion was animals, so I went to the institute.</seg>
<seg id="157">I studied there for two years.</seg>
<seg id="158">He learns to treat all animals from cats to cows. "</seg>
<seg id="159">He said: "I know I never will talk to their children about their experiences.</seg>
<seg id="160">It is not what children should know, and, of course, is not what they need to survive.</seg>
<seg id="161">His mother, Marina, 42, said: "The pain never leaves me.</seg>
<seg id="162">She's in my soul, and worse, when the anniversary is approaching.</seg>
<seg id="163">I will go and I will be present at the ceremonies, which will be held, to celebrate her.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know that George did not go.</seg>
<seg id="165">For him it should be even stronger, because he was there, and I'm not.</seg>
<seg id="166">I was waiting for him at home and could not help.</seg>
<seg id="167">I am so grateful to God that he came back to me... Here in Beslan imprint lies on each.</seg>
<seg id="168">He remains with us.</seg>
<seg id="169">George, now an adult, but the nightmare was still with him.</seg>
<seg id="170">It is difficult to take when something so terribly unfair, happens to you.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was a boy, he loves sports, but they can't do because of the knee.</seg>
<seg id="172">He had several operations, he can walk, but can't exercise.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say that the 50% he overcame this nightmare, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.</seg>
<seg id="174">This eerie experience will remain with us.</seg>
<seg id="175">Many of my friends and neighbors had been killed during the capture, and this only reinforces my pain.</seg>
<seg id="176">I lost a lot of people who I knew well and who was my road.</seg>
<seg id="177">My son with me, and this is the best gift God could I do, but my heart aches for those who had been killed.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know the family, where the children were born, but I know and widows who never married.</seg>
<seg id="179">It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.</seg>
<seg id="180">I'll never forget how выпрыгнуло heart out of my chest at that moment when I saw him in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="181">Now I look at what is happening in the world, "the war in different regions.</seg>
<seg id="182">These people are fighting for that?</seg>
<seg id="183">Why are they killing each other?</seg>
<seg id="184">The war is very close to our country right now, and I can hardly believe it.</seg>
<seg id="185">We were a close-knit country in the past, as it turned out, however, that we are fighting now?</seg>
<seg id="186">Men and children are suffering, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine, and many will be killed.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips, how to achieve a better quality of underwater photos and video</seg>
<seg id="2">If you want to take photos or shoot video under water, you have a number of options.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is waterproof "Point and Shoot," for example, the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or, for example, captures экшн-камера Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I took these pictures on a family holiday with the help of several cameras, all for the price of about $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">No matter what equipment you are using, you need to comply with several regulations, in order to achieve the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Перепроверяйте their equipment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the case of the other camera and tightly closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, the camera for the type of photos or videos that you shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some photos and video cameras filming or object type is regimes that optimise exposure for затемненных underwater conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in the water, look at how deeply your equipment can fall.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are aimed only at 5 feet, others - 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Look at our leadership and the buyer's ratings for the traditional digital cameras, as well as for advance models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Remove a few frames - because many of them don't enclosures.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Мыльниц" have LCD that can help you take, then assign them as экшн-камер usually are not.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have LCD, it will be difficult to see under the water, and the layout of the frame is a random process.</seg>
<seg id="16">So do a few frames.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also, if you have your camera's serial shooting mode, which takes several shots with slightly different plant, use them.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay near the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">The amount of light is significantly reduced, the deeper you нырнете under water.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, stay at the surface, when you're shooting in a swimming pool, a river or ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">It will also allow you to transfer more colors in the photos, the more you can, the fewer colors you'll see.</seg>
<seg id="22">Подплывайте closer to shooting.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is excellent advice for shooting on the land, but it is even more important under the water because затемненных light conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is especially important if you're shooting on экшн-камеру: This equipment often comes with a fixed, широкоугольной lens, which means that you have to get close to it, if you want to fill the frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was such a man, whose force of personality could shake things around, even in such a giant organization like the National Health Service.</seg>
<seg id="2">Консультирующий anaesthetist, he has devoted his career to rid patients as suffering from illness, and from such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among those who spoke to him, recalls his wife, was the officer M16, who had to live with devastating effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that as long as doctors considered being diagnosed and diseases, those who is mainly concerned about something completely different - the pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, however, he found himself, who began to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I did not feel, as usual," he wrote in May last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I found it hard to find strength in herself.</seg>
<seg id="8">Struggling with symptoms similar to flu, he found that irritated reproaches his wife, Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want to make it happen sooner, rather than later," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Juliet went on for a week, Lawson found that unusual and it is not clear why he was upset.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked a colleague to do chest X-rays.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks before he went skiing in the Alps, lead.</seg>
<seg id="14">The results of the X-rays came.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was mesothelioma, a terminal cancer, which affects the lungs плевру, or shell.</seg>
<seg id="16">For most cancers it is difficult to determine an exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although some people succumb to cancer of the lung, for example, not all lung cancer patients who smoked.</seg>
<seg id="18">But with mesothelioma differently.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, grainy construction material, who once called a "miracle," but which, as we now know, deadly dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us is disease mesothelioma, which can be not to pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos, in the end, is the material from the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in the UK since the 1960s, when these industrial ban came into force.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even when it has been used, only people from specific sectors worked in close contact with him: Трубоизолировщики, builders, carpenters and customized workers, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">Industrial toxin from another era, he hardly seems cause for concern today.</seg>
<seg id="25">But such a calm it would be a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it turns out, is now at the peak of the epidemic of this type of cancer is exposure.</seg>
<seg id="27">Here is dying of this type of cancer is exposure from more people than in any other country on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="28">The annual death rate at about 2500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease than as a result of road crashes.</seg>
<seg id="29">The annual number of deaths of this type of cancer is exposure since 1980 and projected the number of deaths in the UK in the future</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason we feel its deadly consequences right now, is that, although the use of asbestos is illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), for the development of this type of cancer is exposure are usually tens of years.</seg>
<seg id="31">And attack of this type of cancer is exposure is not limited to veterans specialties industrial construction.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was, and is, in many cases, remains in the house where we live, where we work, offices, schools, shops, where we are and where we go shopping.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention in class, the level of prosperity, profession or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">Избранности bastions, the fashionable London department stores to private schools, as it turned out, not salvation.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parliament building is riddled with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even hospitals that are meant to treat us, turned out to be reservoirs of this fatal a carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was not трубоизолировщиком.</seg>
<seg id="39">In fact, he had to think where he might have come into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he realized.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It seems that there might be asbestos in tunnels in the hospital, where Guy I spent six years on an internship," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">All are students, nurses, doctors, and by chance - used these тоннелями.</seg>
<seg id="43">I wonder how many of my peers expect the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">It was a question to which, unfortunately, he was able to give a partial response.</seg>
<seg id="45">"From four doctors, which we in the hospital and Guy have subsequently developed mesothelioma in the last five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I alone remained alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us expect this disease?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Лоусону was diagnosed with mesothelioma, "" when he was 48 years old.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">Live so long is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty percent of patients die from mesothelioma eight months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">She always lethal.</seg>
<seg id="52">So, now, we can only repeat Лоусона question: "How many of us expect this disease?"</seg>
<seg id="53">According to a leading expert on type in the UK, Professor Джулиану Пито, most likely to assume that the years between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain should bootmaker, emotional over-reactions people about to die.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most now are that they die that way.</seg>
<seg id="55">Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada telecentres are being set up</seg>
<seg id="56">A quick review of reports from the halls of the court, where victims are often seek compensation, shows how far it has spread attack of this type of cancer is exposure.</seg>
<seg id="57">In June, for example, Marks & Spencer acknowledged that the USTR Джэнис Ellen contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and a plethora of clothing departments at two sites, one of which was the store on Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs Ellen was only 18 years old, when she started working at M & S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now her two children are older than 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Before this happened," she says, "I had never heard about the type, I barely knew about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="62">And in my head I could not come to that, I will.</seg>
<seg id="63">Few people really know a lot about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="64">In fact, asbestos is not one substance, and a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">They get their name from the word "асбестиформ", which means the fibrous structure, which tells them the strength and flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="66">Of those six, three were often used in construction.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotile asbestos, widely known as white, more often found in other buildings today.</seg>
<seg id="68">It has been used in roofing panels, an outdoor stove pipes, shower and boiler rooms, thermal insulation, even in brake Fenerbahce.</seg>
<seg id="69">He смертелен less than other forms of asbestos, but all the same, as the European Union and the World Health Organization is "a source of serious health damage," which can lead to death.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, brown asbestos (амозит) and blue asbestos (крокидолит).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that "there are good, though indirect reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with mesothelioma [in the UK]."</seg>
<seg id="72">“Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the main store on Oxford Street, London telecentres are being set up</seg>
<seg id="73">Джэнис Ellen may not have thought of myself as a victim of this type of cancer is exposure, but work Julian Пито suggests that her story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that "a significant percentage of мезотелиом when there is no known exposure at work or at home, were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment."</seg>
<seg id="75">Much of this impact, he says, is "normal" and the impact of weather on our building.</seg>
<seg id="76">No one, it seems, can't be sure that he is safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">The report Goddard Consulting, which was in the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in government, could be exposed to unconsciously.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009, Goddard said that technical mines and pipelines for the premises of parliamentary committees were infected with deadly asbestos fibers, which can follow the movement of something as harmless as "strong currents of air."</seg>
<seg id="79">Members of the parliament often blame the fact that they are pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.</seg>
<seg id="80">Although the Board of maintenance of Parliament insisted that Westminster Palace received a "clean bill of health now," she acknowledged, however, that it is necessary to work on the £1 billion for the reconstruction of the parliament, by upgrading electrician and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, members of parliament, will meet in a nearby conference centre and their fertility rates collapse, not on the green benches horizon.</seg>
<seg id="81">The report Goddard said that "the situation with asbestos is not Poland, in accordance with the various rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">It is impossible to know whether this error management cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All we can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">One of those who have not managed to identify his contact with asbestos, "a general practice doctor, Graham cost.</seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson, cost, 50 years, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I was working at the hospital, which has successfully brought claims associated with asbestos," he says, "But I can't prove this in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">So it is hard to remember all the places where he worked, and the date.</seg>
<seg id="88">He remembers clearly, so this day in early December 2009 when his wholly overcame something that was like the flu.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly I started were shaken as.</seg>
<seg id="91">It started very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terrible.</seg>
<seg id="93">I thought that I could go all the way to homes.</seg>
<seg id="94">Cost of being a doctor, knew the pain comes from the shell, including checking for iframe loads around the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="95">However, like Джэнис Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect мезотелиому.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the end, he could not walk to work a month.</seg>
<seg id="97">US doctors doing chest x-rays and put плевральные катетеры to pull fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis.</seg>
<seg id="98">And yet his condition оставлось without a diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">Gradually, his health has improved, and he returned to work.</seg>
<seg id="100">But from time to time the same symptoms return, often after he was involved in sport, and he breathed heavily.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, one of the patients came to him in the office of grimly with similar symptoms, and he was later diagnosed with mesothelioma. ""</seg>
<seg id="102">But even then the cost is not associated with their own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">In the end, it was the patient for dozens of years older and worked directly with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">In this case, the connection was obvious.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011, the situation worsened again and listened grimly, his doctor showed him the results of the CT and X-ray images of the group.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, exactly two years after the cost began to feel ill, the sensor, equipped with a camera, was introduced into his chest cavity between the shell, and the shell of his lung.</seg>
<seg id="107">I'm an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I usually just go further, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="109">I'm not too upset about it, to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife was.</seg>
<seg id="111">The biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I've been told that this is mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham: Cost of mesothelioma diagnosis</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly cost sank during a meeting with Macmillan nurses, one of which suggested he contact a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">It was then that he realised the scale of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turns out that asbestos is widely used, especially in large public buildings, and where quite often there was asbestos thermal insulation systems on the pipes," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, now succumb to the disease.</seg>
<seg id="117">Thus, mesothelioma now affects more young people, atypical professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous asbestos pipes isolated in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees, who were on the pedestrian tunnels connecting nearby landmasses can bring together, to get from one building to another (as Andrew Lawson), or eat in the basement canteens (how often did Graham cost) almost certainly really were exposed to toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">For several decades after the war, it turns out, the hospital was a place where, in theory, legalistic поциентов for life, but the place, which constituted a threat to life for doctors who treated them.</seg>
<seg id="121">It still continues to remove today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students set their tap Бунзена burner on asbestos</seg>
<seg id="123">And it's not just hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and мэриях because of their insulating material and огнестойких characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="125">The schools, too.</seg>
<seg id="126">In fact, many for the first time, is likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="127">Across the country, countless chemistry lessons, students set their burners Бунзена asbestos on tap.</seg>
<seg id="128">Appeared on websites, Ad problem of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as floor tiles or roof сараев usually contained asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"This is an industrial poison in a huge number of our buildings," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented the case against Andrew Лоусона hospital Guy.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case, the only contact the woman could remember was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So be careful, снося garden sheds.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effect of the diagnosis, when we know that the disease is incurable, is huge.</seg>
<seg id="134">"To realize it, is quite a lot of time," says Graham cost.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realized that I couldn't concentrate on what I'm doing.</seg>
<seg id="136">I spent two weeks in surgery.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I realized that I have to go out and deal with them.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I'm no longer a Christmas</seg>
<seg id="139">One of the most difficult things was the transition from doctor to patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">As countless patients before him, he remembers, was confused with information that it was necessary to take.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was difficult to understand," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked his doctor" how many I have time? "</seg>
<seg id="143">I was given about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember, as I thought, "Well, I am no longer a Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's all. "</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, as it is the mechanics of how we are in life, "the very act of breathing, raises cancer, which kills.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases of this type of cancer is exposure caused by contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos is composed of tiny fibers.</seg>
<seg id="149">When asbestos is being destroyed and the carcinogenic fibers, they can get stuck in the lungs плевре, shell.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibers are annoying плевру and may cause cell mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem is due to the inhalation of asbestos fibres needle," Professor Tom Трежер кардиоторакальный, a surgeon, who came to the hospital in 2001, Guy.</seg>
<seg id="152">The hospital, where Andrew Lawson, as suspected, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, is the lead center for the treatment of this type of cancer is exposure.</seg>
<seg id="153">Трежер Лоусона knew and had treated some of the others who, perhaps, was exposed to while in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">When Sally Goodin Sally goodun Etc asbestos in the lung tissue, "says Трежер, breathing their course on the periphery, where the shell.</seg>
<seg id="155">It is, in its essence, invasive process from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="156">Conventional treatments of other forms of cancer is much less efficient the type.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of surgery, for example, cause hot debate.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some think that it is worth trying.</seg>
<seg id="159">Трежер disagrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">"You can't cut плевру," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">No good around her with a knife.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, this cancer chemotherapy is "not very well", which "acts", but not people.</seg>
<seg id="163">"From time to time there are patients who live a long time," says Трежер.</seg>
<seg id="164">But in the end, they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some patients are living much, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">Writer Stephen Jay Gould died in 20 years after he was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years after diagnosis, Graham cost continues to fight.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he became ill, mesothelioma grimly acquainted with Andrew Лоусоном, which, four years after the diagnosis, single-handedly turned into a desk support and consultation for these same patients.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Yes, Раковая Central," he said cheerfully, when they called.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," says cost.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was diagnosed four years ago, and he still is very energetic.</seg>
<seg id="172">First Эбботту offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and would have prolonged his life only a month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was in despair," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, managed to give the few a more positive agenda. "</seg>
<seg id="176">Meeting with several specialists, cost decided to continue treatment with Professor Лоиком Ланж-Лаздунски second, a professor of surgery at the hospital, Guy.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage in that I don't need it, I just called them and they took me," admits Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">Consultants to the patient would have to get the direction and approval for funding.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money plays a pivotal role for patients with mesothelioma, so as to get the best available treatments.</seg>
<seg id="180">But when such treatments become ineffective, finally, inevitably, many patients still face with one financial reason for concern "about the future of families that they would leave.</seg>
<seg id="181">And then they ask the courts for compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan, of Field Fisher Price Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It has been known that asbestos is harmful to health, in 1898," said Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But that changed in the 1960s, it became clear that even very small amounts can put their health at risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">It was then spoke about the bad faith of companies.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson, and Guy's Hospital, ultimately, resolve the case, but it was not "the full cost of the settlement," said Morgan, as Lawson could not clearly prove that his mesothelioma was the result of exposure to asbestos at Guy Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation into his death, hospital spokesman Guy is confirmed, however, that "asbestos in its basement, mentioned above, was removed in the 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="188">It was too late for Andrew Лоусона.</seg>
<seg id="189">How to remove asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">In fact, tie a contact with asbestos to one company or place of work - usually through dozens of years after that, it turned out to be a big problem for patients with mesothelioma, demanding compensation.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have the owner or shut down.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance archives could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who are protected from lawsuits, know that time is on their side, the plaintiffs, of course, no.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, this year took serious new legislative acts which facilitate the recovery of patients with mesothelioma compensation, even if it is impossible to keep track of their former employers.</seg>
<seg id="195">In accordance with this law, was £350-миллионный fund of funds, which is financed by the insurance industry, for those who had been diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove, but did not contact anyone with whom to sue.</seg>
<seg id="196">In such cases, patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in a case for compensation of about £120,000.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected to each year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with mesothelioma, believes that the £350 million represent a "very good work" for the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"This transaction, which insured for insurers," he says, hinting that the sum is a quarter of that, insurers would have to pay if it had not intervened time and patients with mesothelioma could track the company and file a lawsuit in the usual way.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even Mike Пеннинг, previously minister for work and pensions, has acknowledged that the law "imperfect."</seg>
<seg id="201">However Пеннинг and Morgan, and recognize that, with seven people die every day, rapid action was needed.</seg>
<seg id="202">"People suffer so much, and they need help now," said Пеннинг during the second reading of the Bill about type in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">By the time Graham cost was in the hands of Professor Лоика Ланж-Лаздунски 19 months.</seg>
<seg id="204">After the initial consultation Ланж-Лаздунски recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Трежера, he believes.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was followed by radiation and chemotherapy -- тритерапия, in which entire Ланж-Лаздунски boasts 40 per cent of patients surviving for five years.</seg>
<seg id="206">Cost of felt a surge of strength.</seg>
<seg id="207">"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says cost.</seg>
<seg id="208">You see these patients all the time.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is a force that supports you.</seg>
<seg id="210">When сдаешься, the condition can deteriorate very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham lay down on the cost of the operation in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">By the end of August he finished the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">The scan showed no trace of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I did a scan in March [2014].</seg>
<seg id="215">There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I just had to come.</seg>
<seg id="217">It is not the threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="218">This is the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="219">And again the cost went through six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now there is no trace of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="221">But this process, both physically and emotionally heavy.</seg>
<seg id="222">You can think about practical things - about finances, and when I die, for example, or about the fact that we need to show his wife, works as a timer on бойлере.</seg>
<seg id="223">When you get bad news, you become безрадостным.</seg>
<seg id="224">We need to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="225">As the father of Ellie, 16, and 14 years old, it's Тэмзин is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">"It's hard for the parent," he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.</seg>
<seg id="228">For the first time when I was diagnosed, I told the girls that I had the disease, which means that I won ’ t live to old age.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose their leaders; protesters promise revenge</seg>
<seg id="2">China's parliament adopted a decision Sunday not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates in the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reforms.</seg>
<seg id="3">Such a move is likely to mark the beginning of “long protests in Hong Kong as activists have begun planning and mobilization in a matter of hours after that statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the National People ’ s Congress, in fact, communist leaders to remove all the candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's not обмануло our expectations, but still leads in rage," said lawmaker Emily VAH, chairman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's not that Beijing had promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">They lied to the people of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defending the decision of China, Li Fey, Deputy Secretary General of the Standing Committee of the National People ’ s Congress, said that to allow public nomination for Hong Kong's leadership elections, it would be too "erratic behavior."</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing promised to allow residents to vote by the region's governments, starting in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chinese leaders have taken the decision as a democratic step forward, since it gives a direct vote гонконгцам right; however, the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold in his hands the process with the help of the Commission for nominating candidates, rigidly controlled from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, according to a new article that only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision was taken after the summer, when there have been some of the most extensive and unprecedented protests in Hong Kong for many years.</seg>
<seg id="14">For a large part of the campaign is a movement in Hong Kong after Occupy Central With Love and Peace, which threatened to cut off the financial district in Hong Kong if Beijing does not guarantee of universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday night, a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="16">The demonstration, which organisers claimed that their movement is shifting to a new phase of civil disobedience and that they rise up on the waves of protest in the following weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, they have not announced details, apparently in an effort to avoid problems with the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In онлайн-заявлении, the organizers said the movement "to capture the central region обдумывало only as an exceptional measure, action that can be taken only if all the possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We regret to inform you that today, all possibilities have been exhausted and the seizure of the central district of dialogue will take place.</seg>
<seg id="20">Authorities in Hong Kong were preparing to Beijing a few days, and on Sunday the government had strengthened security measures involving police and barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">The unrest is the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their own city.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of people from the mainland reinforcing competition in the area of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also intensifies the fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some have criticised Occupy Central movement, saying that his demonstration to jeopardize the businesses - the lifeblood of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protest, which they say, it could lead to a tantrum, depending on how many people would take part or how long," said lawmaker Regina Yip, who has long been critical of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="26">We don't want to have to worry about the fact that Hong Kong is out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This view, which is harmful for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chinese state media have also reported in recent days, activists of the democratic movement in Hong Kong which they were considering Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral law, which drew 780000 participants - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.</seg>
<seg id="30">In July tens of thousands came out to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists brought up the issue of race and the behaviour of the police after Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">Unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Фергюсоне, Missouri, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">(Raise hands, chanting: "Hands up, don't ice", while they are waiting in a queue before burial.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Missouri Фергюсоне, linked to the killing of teenager Michael Brown, change the blogger зоила Miriam Perez noticed a shift in интернет-разговоре among white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">In her experience, the white feminists, stamps, comments: "Gender" above race, when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, as the pressure grew on the Midwest and attracted national attention, Peres saw the white women who is 100 percent focused on the race.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared with the reaction of black women shortly after the killing on 9 August, personal essays with such titles as "thoughts about Фергюсоне from white women" and "Феминизм - it's not just about the United States women" appeared relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But they have shown a significant shift for Perez.</seg>
<seg id="9">"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who are talking about white skin and Privileges on such a high level," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People feel the need to say something about what has happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is a very symbolic for the crisis with which we are faced, and because of the situation in Фергюсоне) is so tied to race, they feel that at this point.</seg>
<seg id="12">For Professor of English at the University of Ohio Кориты Mitchell Ferguson has laid bare problems that blacks face every day, but which are not perceived as "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can write something funny on Facebook about what is going on with me and my partner, and get 150 лайков from everywhere," says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">When I write something about how the colored people are attacked in his own country, оглушает silence.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Why do women safe to speak publicly about the relationship, but not about the security in the public sector?" She asks.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women, like Mitchell, who studied the issues of race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between matters relating to race and gender.</seg>
<seg id="17">From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly separate the problems; they are faced with a complex reality every day.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women now bring together issues of race and gender in feminist мейнстриме, Энджела Хэттери, professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that its predecessor did.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 1865 and 1890 линчевали for years, at least 10,000 black men, it is almost always served and the rape of a white woman," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="20">The woman was white, in 1941, to substantiate the story.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the point of view of Хэттери, the gap between white and black women occurred when White free, for example, Susan B. Anthony looked at the situation in the late 1800s, and saw that the fight for suffrage will be effective only for one of the groups: Women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They decided to lay all the eggs in the basket of voting rights for women, and the right to vote for blacks would appear later," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="23">Looking back on things like this gives us a clear idea of why women of color don't trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have not done anything good.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to white women united against mob lynchings in the Women's Association for preventing mob lynchings of the South.</seg>
<seg id="27">This group has nearly 40 years after the first black women to help, "said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">From the point of view of Mitchell, the reactions of white feminists on the issues raised in the situation, "police behavior Фергюсоне, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white a feminist had to" catch up "problems with which the black women cope in several generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It is true, it would be great if women who have such a [traditional феминистическая] ideology, would seriously to bring up a child, how they relate to the right to contraception?" Asked Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="30">The second wave feminists who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to контрацептивам, now are beginning to understand what that means.</seg>
<seg id="31">Known white феминистического movement activist Gloria Стайнем two weeks after the killing of Michael Brown took Фейсбуком and sharp колумнистки Guardian published an article by Rebecca Carroll, who claimed that white Americans have more involvement in protests on issues of racism.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope that women who have a similar but different, reason to understand the danger of the body," and the point of view of the racial problems that are substantially different in surveys of the public - will be at the head of the change, "wrote Стайнем.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Стайнем guarantee for more пересекающийся feminism, which includes and issues of race, gender, and her comments about race in America still fascinate some.</seg>
<seg id="34">The American entrepreneurial institute researcher Christina Соммерс, author of "Who stole feminism?," she said She The People that young men in the United States, especially young people of color, "are much more vulnerable than their sisters," but Стайнем Фергюсоне contradict the negative criticism, which she expressed earlier.</seg>
<seg id="35">Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for the boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">But when the White House recently initiated a program, "Сторож my brother" to help the vulnerable black and испаноговорящим young men, followed the US changed remarkably from many feminists, including those from Gloria Стайнем.</seg>
<seg id="37">Police relationship with the black community is not the only problem, продвигающая best line of traditional feminism.</seg>
<seg id="38">After being arrested near the U.S. border during 1994ñ2001 unaccompanied minors at the southwestern border in the country this year, immigration reform again came to the surface - this time as a women's problem.</seg>

<seg id="40">"They speak for themselves," said China.</seg>
<seg id="41">When the vast majority of work visas are issued [иммигрантам-мужчинам], women who come to them are in position, vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the market for electric cars</seg>
<seg id="2">This week the Ministry of Economic Development will make the government a comprehensive plan for the development of clean vehicles in Russia, told the deputy director of the ministry, Oleg Плужников the Round Table, held in Moscow's Vedomosti declared - 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">The plan is drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals - reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is expected that the document will be passed in late September and early October, says Плужников, proposed measures concern the development plan for the development of electric cars and hybrids - vehicles on газомоторном fuel in Russia are already there.</seg>
<seg id="5">The plan (a copy of the Vedomosti) is designed for 2014-2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">To develop the criteria for the evaluation of electrical and hybrid vehicles and decide how to promote the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">The government report, which will be described in the tax and customs measures quality support, will be prepared by December 2014, the scheme of preferential loans and preferential hiring will appear by April 2015, and proposals to reduce the prices of cars, and the creation of service the infrastructure will be developed by October 2015</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014-2015, it is expected to make changes in regulations to ease conditions for the construction of the infrastructure charge (parking, petrol stations etc.).</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, federal officials plan for 2015 to formulate proposals for regional authorities, as well as to promote the use of clean transport - in the form of giving him the benefit of a movement and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and the expansion of government purchases of such transport.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, the Ministry of Economic Development by October 2014, on a list of indicators to assess the work of regional authorities of criteria that reflect the effectiveness of support production of environmentally clean transport, the development of the infrastructure charge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Single market in Russia is still only formed in 2013 across the country sold around 100 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the beginning of the 2014 обнулена an import duty on electric cars, so sales will be approximately 500 pieces, predicts, the chief executive of Mitsubishi Motors in Andrew's wife.</seg>
<seg id="13">But пятикратный growth does not make any noticeable: Electric cars in Russia in 2013, according to the Association of European Businesses, sold 2,78 million cars and light commercial vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="14">While electric cars in Russia imports only Mitsubishi Motors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Start import is preparing Renault - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says director for strategic planning and partnerships in Russia Renault Ремиз Nicolas.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most other manufacturers of electric transport took in relation to Russia is taking a wait-and-see approach.</seg>
<seg id="17">Development of electric cars and Russian manufacturers GAZ directors "," ",", "but the trivial.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in January - July 2014, according to the "АСМ-холдинга," Avtovaz has issued 30 rivals.</seg>
<seg id="19">Modest because of soaring prices for 2009-2014, admits director of AvtoVAZ in Latvia, Sergei Аманов, without state support the breakthrough in this segment will not.</seg>
<seg id="20">The development of the Russian market in addition to the new electric cars (those electric cars that are sold in Russia, on average, twice as much as the internal combustion engine) is an underdeveloped infrastructure charge (Higher School - units), "sighs of Автостата Sergei Целиков."</seg>
<seg id="21">Because of the soaring prices and low rates of reducing the cost of electric cars in the next 3-4 years remain нишевым segment of the Russian market, "said chief editor Mikhail Авторевю Подорожанский Целиков, agrees with him.</seg>
<seg id="22">Car manufacturers, in contrast, say that some rivals are already close to the value of the ordinary.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Russian Army market prospects, the important thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "real" электромобильность; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of the new charging stations, underscores the president of BMW's Wolfgang Шлимме.</seg>
<seg id="24">Such infrastructure projects, for example, is implementing the "Россети": In Moscow several stations, soon there will be about 80.</seg>
<seg id="25">Talks on the construction of the network and the Higher School of Economics carried out with other regions.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to the director of the department "Россетей" Vladimir Софьина, the company believes the market is ready to build electric and gas stations across the country, but there are problems: A small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric cars of various brands.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, "Россети" as the Company does not have the right to engage in the sale of electricity, to do this in relation to charge electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="28">His wife believes the most effective measure in support of Russia's market rivals обнуление customs duties.</seg>
<seg id="29">Zero rate will act before the end of 2014, its extension, expansion of preferential list.</seg>
<seg id="30">The transportation tax to environmental (the idea is being discussed and concerns all machines), too, will support the market, but not as noticeably as customs preferences, his wife said.</seg>
<seg id="31">Tax in Russia is small, said Pankov, unlike, for example, from Norway, where the reduced tax rate led to a sharp rise in sales of electric cars are now account for 12% of the market.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, and the need for stimulus measures, such as free parking in the centre of town (as it has done in Moscow), I am sure Pankov, or to move substantially in dedicated lanes, which in Russia.</seg>

<seg id="7">The weakening of the ruble is long-term in nature and, in tandem with the euro, and in tandem with the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="8">The long-term forecast assumed that mark, "says senior analyst Anna Альпари Бодрова." "</seg>
<seg id="9">All of that has to do with Ukraine, one way or another will be reflected on the courses.</seg>
<seg id="10">As long as this continues, investors will react.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, rumors about the invading troops are not confirmed nor on the one hand, but the market was very emotional.</seg>

<seg id="13">This week, according to specialist, will be closed around these levels, and the ruble 36,90 37,05 dollar.</seg>
<seg id="14">The tax period ended, oil prices, weak policies, sanctions, the problem of transit of gas through Ukraine are all links in the same chain.</seg>

<seg id="18">Still, will look at whether to impose sanctions on Saturday promised, as will meet NATO.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said the ruble weakened sharply after the tax season, then went to Ukraine, the Central Bank said last week that, until the end of the year to a fully floating exchange rate and waives any currency interventions.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you look at the daytime wobble, it is no different from the previous ones during this month, all have spooked that mark in 37 rubles, "continued the analyst.</seg>
<seg id="21">And so, in terms of the turnover of a nothing has happened.</seg>
<seg id="22">Worrying times for the foreign exchange market, I would like to remind you that at the end of January was an increased demand for the currency, as well as of March, when the Central Bank отгрузил a record number of currency.</seg>
<seg id="23">In UFS IC and see the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="24">First of all, it is the growth of the budget income from exports, as well as improving the competitiveness of domestic manufacturers at the expense of more expensive imports, says chief analyst UFS IC Alexei Kozlov.</seg>
<seg id="25">Negative moments can be attributed to the cost of imported goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, rising inflation pressures and, as a result, become more expensive for borrowing funds which, in turn, slows down the development of the country's economy.</seg>
<seg id="27">If we talk about the stock market, the rouble devaluation smoothes over a decline in stock prices, expressed in roubles.</seg>
<seg id="28">For example, the MICEX index during trading Thursday fell 1.67 per cent, while the RTS Index lost 3.27 percent.</seg>
<seg id="29">Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of reduction of indices due to a weakening of the ruble during the day more than 1.5%.</seg>
<seg id="30">The weakening of the ruble is an emotional character and can be explained by a massive desire to buy the currency.</seg>
<seg id="31">In practice, gradually go on emotion, and quotes the ruble partially or completely restore lost ground.</seg>
<seg id="32">"We believe, soon we will be able to see the value of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles to the dollar," said Alexei Kozlov.</seg>

<seg id="2">Восстанавливающаяся economy means more customers, the more sales and jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Account for taxes at the state and local level for companies across the country, moderately increased in the last year, which accelerated the recovery, according to a new study, published last week, and the company in the Washington area is no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">The company in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion in the coffers of the state and local level in fiscal 2013, to 3.8 percent more than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tax burden on business in the state and local level in the past year, rose 4.3 percent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after avoiding each other years, when accounts declined in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">State taxes, rose 4.3 percent, faster than the local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to the research, which was carried out, the professional services firm, Ernst & Young and the Center on taxation, the tax policy.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the tax revenue in the county, 56 percent, in taxes on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of tax revenue for Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the amount of tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="10">To a large extent, is caused by the growth of tax revenues to the same level of the value of real estate companies, the researchers say, that raised property taxes by 3.7 per cent this year, after three years in a row, when growth was less than 1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large proportion of those earnings in larger states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same thing is happening in the Washington area.</seg>
<seg id="12">The company in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion property taxes at the state and local level in the past year, to $9.6 billion more than in 2012, an increase of 4.2 per cent, compared with the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the return of the value of the property does not have a similar effect on the growth of tax revenue for the state and local level in Maryland, where property taxes barely exceed one-fifth of companies' tax bills.</seg>
<seg id="14">Virginia and the District of Columbia are paying about half the tax bills at the state and local level, in the form of property taxes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"What is happening in Maryland is that real estate is such a big part of their tax base, especially around the District of Columbia, belongs to either the government or nonprofit organization that does not pay property taxes," said Douglas Линдхолм, executive director of the Center on taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, Maryland forced to rely much more on personal income taxes, for example, to pay for those services that exist in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent increase in tax receipts from businesses cannot fully explain the recovery of the real estate market.</seg>
<seg id="18">Income entrepreneurs also, it seems, are on the mend, according to this data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Companies in the region, Chinese corporate income tax at a level of $2.3 billion to $2.1 billion more than in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland has collected $1 billion of corporate income tax, the most in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although trends are aimed in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase with the same speed in all three areas.</seg>
<seg id="22">The level of growth in the District of Columbia was on the same level as the average for the country of 4.3 per cent, while growth was significantly faster in Maryland, 4.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only Virginia was the rise in tax revenues, equal to the average of 4.1 per cent.</seg>

<seg id="25">In Maryland corporate rate of 8.25 percent, whereas in the District is relatively high - 9,975 percent.</seg>
<seg id="26">A similar study of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that in Virginia is lower taxes for entrepreneurs at the state and local level and, on the whole, a more favorable climate in terms of taxes for entrepreneurs, than in Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="27">The district has not been evaluated in this study.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite his advantage, Virginia is facing competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south.</seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina recently signed the statute that corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same as in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="30">If, by contrast, will continue to be targets in the next year, this law could bring income tax rate for entrepreneurs, even up to 3 per cent by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="31">Meanwhile, a small business in the Washington area, it seems, feels better and, thus, pay more in taxes at the state and local level, according to a recent study.</seg>
<seg id="32">Taxes for entrepreneurs, in the form of individual income tax paid by small business owners, a transition structure, which arranged the majority of small firms in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, with much greater speed than taxes for предпринимателй in general.</seg>
<seg id="33">The researchers say that the trend and an increase in revenues from taxes on businesses across the country are likely to persist this year, with the proceeds of the tax on turnover in the governments of the state and local level, from 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year.</seg>

<seg id="4">Their debut album, Leif even for a few months to release received 100,000 предзаказов contract, and the issue lies in the portfolio will Warner Music.</seg>
<seg id="5">Given the present situation on the market, a musical плачевную situation from dominating, because this is not about a new this or next to Lana Ray сладкоголосом representative "of the new R 'n' B ', and about the appearance of the British duo быковатых, playing with the level of volume and intensity, that the last time was in a couple of decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">In general, rates on the first album in connection with all вышеозначенными circumstances were especially high and it is quite justified.</seg>
<seg id="7">The duo has taken his name, which previously could encroach on that quite so desperate and hairy metalheads, which flows the blood of kings, how they think, they have in the veins, too.</seg>

<seg id="9">To make predictions about the success of this enterprise until, perhaps, pretty early, but you can have something to say.</seg>
<seg id="10">A dozen songs, with a small уложившихся in thirty minutes - it's not so much a demonstration of the phenomenal композиторского gifts, self-confident and a powerful statement of intent.</seg>

<seg id="14">But the truth is that each of these songs would sound great at a party of heavy rock, but when playing in a row they merge into a more or less uniform painting.</seg>
<seg id="15">And that's not necessarily bad, on the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="16">The strength of the Royal Blood in the fact that they do not claim the new Lennon and McCartney (that mark this in successors Motörhead), but many of the ghetto рок-дуэты инди-клубов.</seg>

<seg id="20">Heroes ретророка zero with great difficulty outside their postmodern paradigm, with great reluctance, then went on to admit themselves not just эпигонами and independent creative units.</seg>
<seg id="21">Royal Blood will now sound so heavily and the subsequent pressure that this successfully драпирует some вторичность твердолобость and musical material.</seg>

<seg id="2">The fact that the cost of university textbooks for many students more than $1000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move to the second course, came up with an ingenious way to reduce costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">He developed a system of how to take the books in the world, offering them старшекурсников rated compensation that they delayed their sale.</seg>
<seg id="4">"My textbook on mathematical analysis, which typically costs $180 in the semester, I got $10 and biscuits" Chick-fil-A "," says Schroeder, 19, who studies at Ковенант College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The literature on the cost would be $430 last semester, he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He spent $120.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the Council, the average college student spends $1,200 a year on books and supplies, but the students have a number of options to reduce these costs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas, such as the system ’.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rent books is becoming more and more popular, allowing students to use the book for the semester, and often is significantly cheaper than buying them.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Нибо Инкорпорейтид", which holds more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of rental books grew by half since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">Industry studies show that about a quarter of books in university book stores during the past spring semester were taken, "said vice president of Нибо" Trevor Meyer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Less than half of all books are purchased in university book stores, according to the National Association of the professional association of university shops. "</seg>
<seg id="13">Here's introductory course on the best ways to make a deal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Purchase in store</seg>
<seg id="15">Sometimes, if you'll come out with a new book on the internet, the price may be one third from the one that you'll see in the university bookshop.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis," Ron Larson ’ s Bruce Edwards and Robert Хостетлера worth about $290 on privately, but a new instance can be purchased for $239,99 site Chegg.com, which specialises in selling textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Buying a used</seg>
<seg id="18">If you don't use or damage to other people's second-hand textbooks are a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Mathematical analysis" sold for $93,49 подержанном form on to Chegg.com.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Кэсэдей, 25 years, a fourth year student at the University of Бригэм Young, says that Amazon.com paid 42 cents for a used copy of the textbook "strategic decisions in the media: An understanding of the business side of the advertising business."</seg>
<seg id="21">The book sold for $48 new.</seg>
<seg id="22">Teachers, for instance, Ingrid Брейси, director of "without walls" College at the University of Massachusetts in Эмхерсте, offers students refine their professors, not whether to use previous publications.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates are insignificant for classes.</seg>
<seg id="24">In such cases, the old editions can often be found in a very small fraction of the cost of the latest edition.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition to websites Amazon and Chegg, Half.com, "owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying second-hand books.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hire</seg>
<seg id="27">About taking rent textbooks, you need to think, if you're good enough to deal with them, don't forget to return them and don't want to leave them yourself after the course is completed.</seg>
<seg id="28">You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, a student could rent a "Математический analysis" for a semester for about $20.</seg>
<seg id="30">Find out what the rules of the store, where you take books, including any fines that you can write a check for, and the damage.</seg>
<seg id="31">If you take a book, remember: If you do not give the book, fines may even exceed the cost of the new instance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Electronic books</seg>
<seg id="33">Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks is another option.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sometimes, these books take the rent, buying electronic license for a certain period for retailers, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Rent" on the site Chegg.com Mathematical Analysis for six months will cost about $61.</seg>
<seg id="36">Брейси says that students who study literature, can often find the cheapest price, because many of the classics, you can now add the literature on natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.</seg>
<seg id="37">Despite everything, осмотритесь.</seg>
<seg id="38">Joe Who, 29 years old, which is going to start their studies in high school, and recommends Legal Пеппердин use ISBN numbers to find out in a book, as this will ensure that you are looking for precisely the right you text.</seg>
<seg id="39">But before you order online, says, "Who will check whether a book is in stock.</seg>
<seg id="40">To him this lesson Hemsedal is not easy.</seg>

<seg id="40">On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of specific economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which is basically food sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="41">The country banned the import of beef, pork, meat and offal names from poultry, meat, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cheese, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausage and sugar syrups.</seg>
<seg id="42">Restaurants have begun jockeying seems with suppliers: Food prices have increased, we need urgently to counterparts from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="43">This will affect the most expensive restaurants with монокухней France, Italy, Spain, in which products supplied directly from "motherships" countries.</seg>
<seg id="44">Общепиту had their earlier.</seg>
<seg id="45">For example, when, at the beginning of 2014, the Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and the year before - the American and Canadian meat.</seg>
<seg id="46">In return, providers established supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="47">But sanctions лета-2014 proved to be far more serious.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the president's decree, which lifted the ban on Atlantic salmon and trout fry безлактозное seed potatoes, milk, sugar, corn, peas and onions for replanting.</seg>
<seg id="49">An Italian mistake hopes that sanctions might still смягчиться.</seg>

<seg id="53">If the strong, for him it's not going to be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="54">But we have very little such chefs, and for the development of new menu items may take two to three months.</seg>
<seg id="55">Тригель Brasserie restaurant from "The Bridge" is ready for this: The need to withdraw from 10-15%, still half the menu, recycle.</seg>
<seg id="56">In restaurants with a kitchen are starting to replace dishes, for example steak of beef - the marble бефстроганов, says Sergei Mironov.</seg>
<seg id="57">"Cheeses from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian cheeses and cheeses from Serbia, Chile, Argentina, Tunisia," lists the "East-West" Oksana Глибчук.</seg>
<seg id="58">Cream and milk products from Europe have counterparts in Russia and Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="59">Chicken from the United States may be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and salmon from Norway, the park is семгой, those from Belarus and Chile.</seg>
<seg id="60">The absence of vegetables and fruits of European production may be at the expense of domestic manufacturers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.</seg>

<seg id="62">Although it is difficult to have to establishments Ginza Project, he says.</seg>
<seg id="63">The Ginza Project a few dozen restaurants under different brands and with their menu.</seg>

<seg id="69">"The Georgian kitchen no expensive products," says Хатуна Колбая, owner of the Georgian restaurants and cafes "ensure мэ Vai!."</seg>
<seg id="70">All cheeses for us to do in Russia, the basis of many dishes - chicken, exotic herbs we don't use. "</seg>

<seg id="72">Timur colon, owner of the restaurants "Чайхона N1" with Uzbek cuisine, sanctions also might alert: He will have to change not only the новозеландскую sausages.</seg>
<seg id="73">If Russia our owned imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we even win in price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="74">From the CIS can be cheaper to get to engineering, sausages, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit.</seg>

<seg id="90">Even Georgian restaurants in the cost of food will rise by 5-10%, concedes Колбая.</seg>
<seg id="91">"East-West" denies this: "For example, the Belarusian milk products at lowest since August 10 to 15%."</seg>
<seg id="92">"Brazilian suppliers raised prices for pork almost doubled," complained Sergei Cancer, deputy director general of "Стардогс."</seg>

<seg id="7">The point is that sometimes, even with minor damage, in a situation where the accident can be "европротоколу" drivers trapped in the accident, the cause.</seg>
<seg id="8">After all, when there is a policy for the property to get reimbursement without the help of traffic police was impossible.</seg>
<seg id="9">The parameters laid out in the draft guidelines, and are designed to eliminate this obstacle in the way of implementing "европротокола" in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to them, the maximum payout for the property in connection with the accident, without the police, must not be lower than the limit on "европротоколу."</seg>
<seg id="11">But it may not be higher than the limit specified in the agreement, the property insurance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The idea, of course, useful and theoretically capable of relieving both its employees and roads.</seg>
<seg id="13">But, most likely, it didn't come in, neither insurers nor car drivers.</seg>
<seg id="14">The last now talk about a serious threat to the growth of the fraud, which can result in the introduction of new rules for payments on the property.</seg>
<seg id="15">As for the drivers, it is difficult to imagine what kind of work will have to be done to overcome as the Russian conservatism.</seg>
<seg id="16">In most cases, the driver would be hours to wait for the inspectors to make small accident, because more reliably.</seg>
<seg id="17">And we still do not know what will be easier - win or persuade drivers about the reliability of "европротокола."</seg>
<seg id="18">Savings certificate will be registered and безотзывным</seg>
<seg id="19">The Ministry of Finance wants to ban the bearer savings certificates, but will allow banks to do their own version of the безотзывного contribution.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Finance Ministry is preparing a bill that would prohibit savings certificates to the bearer.</seg>
<seg id="21">In recent times, this tool is gaining popularity, as rates here are higher than on bank deposits.</seg>
<seg id="22">The fact is that savings certificates on the bearer not the bank deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper because they don't have to make payments to the Fund Deposit Insurance Agency (pointed out).</seg>
<seg id="23">Пикантность situation that this step will be taken because of the small and medium-sized banks, spreading such certificates, and suffer from Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which, according to the pointed, control 98 per cent of demand.</seg>
<seg id="24">With the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, is about 3.5%.</seg>
<seg id="25">The problem, explains the pointed out, is that a small bank customers who bought such a certificate, in case of license revocation is trying to get money from him in pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying bearer savings certificates, may assume that their investment is insured.</seg>
<seg id="27">The absence of reasonable insurance payments on these certificated in case of license revocation in the bank can lead to misunderstandings and social tensions.</seg>
<seg id="28">In practice, the agencies were cases when предъявительских certificate holders to seek indemnities through the court, "he said in a pointed out.</seg>
<seg id="29">The problem, of course, made-up.</seg>
<seg id="30">After all, paying customers will still be nobody, because under the law they have no right to compensation from the State.</seg>
<seg id="31">If the case was that the tool is not insured in pointed, together with him and would have banned metal accounts, which means citizens are in grams of one of four metals: Gold, silver, platinum and palladium.</seg>
<seg id="32">Since these accounts do not end up in a system of deposit insurance, but their existence as long as no one takes.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is likely that the bearer certificates are very convenient, certifying that actually can act as квазиденег.</seg>
<seg id="34">The move does not control: Any bank customer can buy a certificate to any citizen, and to putting this certificate can change a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is no coincidence that the draft that savings certificate must be issued to security paper, which must be stored in depositories.</seg>
<seg id="36">And that ’ s one, banks are allowed to issue such certificates without the right to early redemption.</seg>
<seg id="37">We have introduced similar безотзывного contribution, which has long been a dream of the bankers.</seg>

<seg id="1">They met the two Union</seg>
<seg id="2">The negotiations in Minsk didn't have problems, for which were called back, but gave rise to a new format: The European Union met with the chief executives of the Eurasian future</seg>
<seg id="3">Let drift and the situation around Ukraine (отлагательств does not tolerate), the leaders of the EU and Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of "hot issues."</seg>
<seg id="4">It is capable of such a structure to work effectively, it is not clear; but it is clear who took the cream from that summit.</seg>
<seg id="5">Questions on this one evening on August 26, when the Belarusians, and after them and other евразийцы with Europeans saw the size of the new President Lukashenko.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Belarusian leader revealed an example of polished talent, it was the behavior of a man who had just caught the jackpot - and is planning a decent old age in high society.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Maidan Lukashenko helped</seg>
<seg id="8">The arrival in Minsk at the three main European commissioners (of EU ministers), who met with Mr. Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf -- not just легитимация president for the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is the subject of an application for recognition of a full European policy and the campaign of the Ukrainian crisis.</seg>
<seg id="10">A senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Studies Denis Мельянцов sure: From now on, Brussels can already speak with Minsk in the same tone as before.</seg>
<seg id="11">"What Catherine Ashton met face to face with Lukashenko, gives reason to believe that the relationship with the EU will be размораживаться and beyond," he said "Огоньку."</seg>
<seg id="12">This is the tip of a hidden part of the push, the Belarusian authorities have begun well before November Maidan in Kiev - 2013-го in summer.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The results have been achieved and the EU is the successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, conversations about modernization," lists "Огонька interlocutor," and with the United States have held talks on international security.</seg>
<seg id="14">States even took a little bit of sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="15">As for the Ukrainian events, then they and their reaction to the Belarus leadership only invoked another influx this process.</seg>
<seg id="16">Minsk, on the one hand, managed to keep relations with Ukraine are warm enough to not lose much in mutual trade, and a President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for talks.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other hand, the Belarusian leader not de jure, who admitted joining of Crimea to Russia and has urged to punish pro-Russian militia in the Donbas with the severity, and quarreled with Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="18">Minsk has not released any of the Customs Union, nor of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, and sometimes it is the Russian air base.</seg>
<seg id="19">Brussels and Washington have noticed a balanced position of Minsk to the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated her, believe the experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">How successful will be Lukashenko's political movement to diversify, will be seen by how often the Minsk should ever take meetings in the format of the EU + TC.</seg>
<seg id="21">The press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy Catherine Ashton and diplomacy have failed to answer questions about what Brussels wants from the relationship in a new format.</seg>
<seg id="22">A spokesman for Ashton said only "Mayan Косьянчич Огоньку" that decisions on issues of war and peace, this issue is not a priority.</seg>
<seg id="23">While there were reports that following a meeting on the Ukraine issue, with the participation of the people in the new format may be, and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="24">A drop of tar in Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that, for him, it turns out, personally asked the representatives of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, at the final briefing Alexander Lukashenko made it clear: All sides are not opposed to Minsk remained the central platform for meeting both Россия--ОБСЕ--Украина format, and at the level of Heads of State and high representatives of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="26">This means that "the last dictator in Europe" has the status of a European leader рукопожатного which helps to solve a global problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">Farmer's best friend</seg>
<seg id="28">Already the EU delegation included еврокомиссаров on trade and energy, pushed to the conclusion: The main underlying reason for the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbas, and economy.</seg>
<seg id="29">In fact, the meeting schedule сверстанное future negotiations for gas supply and to overcome fear of the CU in the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the EU appears to be more extensive than peace declaration without specific dates and numbers.</seg>
<seg id="30">Trade Commissioner Karl De Гюхт, nevertheless, on EU representatives: "We came to Minsk to seek a political solution to the crisis, which has economic consequences, and not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="31">It seems, however, that the economy and the crisis in Ukraine "is working" in Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its consequences - and above all reciprocal sanctions from the West and Russia, offer cut-price, who himself is under pressure until санкционное, with room for maneuver.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to the leader of the Mises Research Centre, the presidents of Belarus Yaroslav Романчука, European investors are actively interested in opportunities to Belarus for supplies of agricultural products to the Russian Federation in bypassing sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="34">The schemes, which are only designed for Vladimir Putin at the summit пожурил Minsk.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Initiated these schemes," said Romanchuk Огоньку "," are not the Belarusian businessmen and Russian companies.</seg>
<seg id="36">They worked for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes were destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Russian business is in desperate need to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of the Belarusian authorities.</seg>
<seg id="38">The second story, "the expert continues," is related to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not averse to the production of the raw material in Belarus as well as focusing on the Russian market.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Ukrainian producers about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and the Belarusian производственно-торговые scheme now could be very popular. "</seg>
<seg id="40">According to Романчука, the role of the host site for the negotiations between the EU and the CU is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of the development of economic ties with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="41">He recalls that the loss of the agricultural sector of the EU sanctions against Moscow are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the Commission is currently suggested they will only 125 million euros in compensation.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Belarusian president may offer to Brussels to work together to minimise the consequences for еврофермеров.</seg>
<seg id="43">This can raise the authority of Lukashenko in the EU on the height.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hospitality without initiatives</seg>
<seg id="45">Catherine Ashton thanked the authorities for the initiative for the summit.</seg>
<seg id="46">But the paradox is that the Minsk from his active role in the birth of the CU + открещивается EU format, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with Ukrainian counterpart emphasized that the new format and it was.</seg>
<seg id="47">"It was your suggestion to come, without any навала discuss, not with бухты-барахты decide, after signing the Association Agreement with the EU, to sort out the situation, which at that time was in Ukraine," he said in front of cameras to Peter Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, observers interpreted it as an attempt to calm Moscow, she reportedly was initially against the mediation, which greatly increases his political weight.</seg>
<seg id="49">The Belarusian diplomatic establishment try to stress that cooperation between the EU and Belarus in the organization in their own land, not the haunted lucrative goals, and the ultimate goal of this format in the future - the creation of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.</seg>
<seg id="50">"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts which, in other areas, in particular in the field of security, puts and promotes the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation," the Foreign Ministry said "Огоньку" for the agency, which in recent times words were chosen very carefully.</seg>

<seg id="13">Oh, and as an archetype and an archetype погоняет вальсирует with an archetype, it is not a movie, and read the abstract painting.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to Russian news reports about his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government has stopped fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately started negotiations on the "statehood" отделившегося region.</seg>
<seg id="3">His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later discloses that Putin had in mind the hint that восточноукраинская territory controlled by the separatists will become part of Russia, but that her status within Ukraine should be revised to give русскоговорящему region to protect their rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, Mr Putin's call for the government to start talks with local government-controlled insurgents as with equal with obvious strategy, which he follows from the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: To help take back the separatists and the Ukrainian government to force новопровозглашенной Новороссии of de facto independence, to closer ties with Russia rather than with the West.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with state television First Channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return retained in the eastern separatists of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were seized in March and April, after Moscow be much stricter in Europe the Ukrainian peninsula Crimea on March 18.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists have recently captured territory Новороссией, or New Russia, the name, which refers to the дореволюционным days of glory of the Russian Empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin has said that anyone who believes that peace talks will occur in the near future, as Ukrainian politicians to campaign for parliamentary elections on October 26, and while government troops attack peace settlement in detained separatists regions, "illusions," Itar-Tass reported's a prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We must immediately begin substantive talks and not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the status of southeast Ukraine, in order to serve the interests of the people living there," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskov said that Putin's words about the state had in mind in the context of the broader autonomy that was discussed during months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to allay fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and language rights at risk.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions, "said Peskov.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and an internal Ukrainian conflict."</seg>
<seg id="12">The intervention of the Kremlin's press secretary, to rectify incorrect "interpretation of the words" Putin stressed the decision of the Russian leadership to behave in relation to the separatist rebellion in the east in any other way than to open the seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the population are ethnic Russians 2-миллионного.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would have to endure much more than heavy battle to attach even Donetsk and eastern Ukraine Луганскую area, since most of the 6.5 million residents are Russians, and polls before the start of the conflict, showed broad support for the desire to stay within Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">Autonomy, which Russian diplomats discussed at international forums would give local governments the power to decide trade agreements and foreign policy, in effect giving the Kremlin the actual control over the territory, which would be combined with the Russian territory Крымом.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Black Sea peninsula, присоединенном five months ago, is the Russian military fleet, as well as commercial marine institutions and historical sea resorts.</seg>
<seg id="16">In regions between Russia's Rostov region and Крымом also are mines, factories and casting plants, which produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.</seg>

<seg id="19">Last call for Putin to Kiev to negotiate with the leaders of the separatists, as with equal, followed by new наступлениями rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks rolled into previously peaceful areas of eastern Ukraine along the Sea of Azov.</seg>
<seg id="20">Supported by Russia, the separatists took control of the city, the occurrence of which Новоазовск officers of the Ukrainian security services say they are afraid that he is starting a campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory to the Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="21">This led to a large-scale civilian and military efforts to strengthen port of Mariupol when, with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Новоазовском and narrow on the Crimean peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko on Saturday addressed the meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which was independent of 23 years.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We are approaching the point of default," warned Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukrainian territory.</seg>

<seg id="1">Anger has turned out to be the most versatile and functional human emotion</seg>
<seg id="2">Сердитое expression is biologically universal for mankind, and everyone involved in its creation of authority and a group of muscles is significant, and is an additional means of expressing power and threat, researchers have found in Australia and the US.</seg>
<seg id="3">About their discovery, they reported in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly, you can read about them in a press release at the University of California in Santa Barbara.</seg>
<seg id="4">Brain expression - and joined опущенные down eyebrows, lips, the thin line раздутые nostrils - equally in all cultures, and make it even blind from birth, children who don't have it, "said study lead author Aaron Селл.</seg>
<seg id="5">As part of a major research project on the nature of the anger, the scientists found that arose this emotion for the effective conduct of disputes during the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="6">The more physical damage one man can do to another, the greater the opportunity to dictate to him, while he pleads to partner with anger.</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers have confirmed their hypothesis: And another physically strong people often get angry and switch to pitch invasions, consider themselves entitled to impose other accept unpleasant conditions for them, and they prefer the methods of peaceful conflict resolution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Starting from that anger is a bargaining emotion, "first of all, the scientists decided that the movement of each of the seven groups of muscles, creating сердитое expression must represent гневающегося individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the other person, and thereby force as soon as possible to agree to its terms in order to avoid conflict.</seg>
<seg id="9">To test this hypothesis, the researchers modelled on a computer, where officials had absent or of each of the seven items гневного face, and showed their students put forth.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although опущенные eyebrow or chin forward 88-4 in isolation is not an evil person, you did this with such human traits more physically strong participants in the study acknowledged unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="11">Anger as human, and with animals, expresses a threat: An exaggerated manifestation of his own forces, in addition to agree and to obey.</seg>
<seg id="12">Man поджимает inflated nostrils and lips with the same purpose, and a frog that надувается or бабуин, which demonstrates their fangs.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Anger" runs "refusal to accept the situation, and the face immediately takes the form, effectively has demonstrated the opposite side of the consequences of this failure.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the most striking is that none of the components гневного faces is not arbitrary, they are one and the same, "said anthropologist John Туби.</seg>
