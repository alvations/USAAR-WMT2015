<seg id="1">Remembering a very American ideal that labor rights are human rights</seg>
<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have offered the bill, which is protected by the unions as a civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Where trade unions, the jobs and the middle class," says Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, who is a co-chair of the Congress of Progressive factions.</seg>
<seg id="4">That is why I am proud to represent the expanding the rights of workers, along with the symbol of the movement for civil rights by John Lewis.</seg>
<seg id="5">This innovative bill will give workers the same opportunities for legal discrimination against trade union organization, and other forms of discrimination, opponents of trade union power</seg>
<seg id="6">The change of the law on regulation of labour relations in such a way as to allow the workers encountering discrimination for participation in trade union organizations, to seek justice in the civil courts, and compensation for damages and punitive payments - a sensible and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it's certainly not radical initiative - at least by American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the best way to understand that offer Ellison, Lewis and co-authors of the bill, "recall is a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the attacks, which the unions have in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - the Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, to expand and to respect human rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">It was the time that millions of Americans still remember when this country simultaneously defend democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas MacArthur and his assistants have helped the country to adopt a constitution, compiled, so as to ensure that the command of autocracy Хидеки Тодзё was replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they have included text that explicitly admitted that "the right of workers to organize and to negotiate, and the collective action is guaranteed."</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Эйзенхауер and his assistants have helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that fascism Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recognizing that workers will have to be organized and be heard in the new state, the Germans have included an article that openly called for the right to form associations with the aim to protect and improve employment and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict or seek to diminish that right, will have no legal force; measures to this end, may be declared illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">When former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was the chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which amounted to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, will be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and included stating that "everyone has the right to organize and join unions to protect their interests."</seg>
<seg id="17">Generations of Americans take for granted our basic position that labor rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country advised by other countries about how to build a civil and democratic society, Americans have explained that the right to organize labor unions - and the fact that this union has participated as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - should be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now, when these rights are under assault in America, wise, indeed, return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to ensure that their voices were heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:</seg>

<seg id="24">Those who attack the unions, forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the U.S., a federal judge on Sunday temporarily has blocked the introduction of Louisiana law, which his supporters say he likely will close all five абортных clinics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to this measure, which was signed by the Governor of Louisiana Bobby Джинадлом in June and was due to enter into force on 1 September, the doctors who do abortions, were obliged to have powers of patients in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, the judge's decision means that, at the moment, doctors can continue to do legal abortions, while continuing to look for such powers.</seg>
<seg id="5">"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally, continuing actions to gain power," wrote in his decision, Judge John деГрэвеллз.</seg>
<seg id="6">The hearing will be scheduled within a month, at which the judge made a more permanent solution on this law.</seg>
<seg id="7">Advocates for abortion rights welcomed the decision, the latest in a succession of decisions against similar measures, saying it will give doctors more time to receive hospital authority.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today's decision ensures that the women will be protected from the League of Louisiana law, which seeks to deprive them of the health and human rights," said Nancy Нортап, president and head of the Center for reproductive Rights, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of three of the five clinics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the decision to the doctors from two clinics, which were claimants in the case, and also filed a declaration on the authority.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, and the courts recently acknowledged such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="11">Key parts of the law that would have closed техасского most of the remaining clinics in this state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fighters for the right to an abortion, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association say the law on the powers to impose enrollment restrictions, doctors are not necessary from the medical point of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, though some also noted the positive effect the closure of clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only one doctor who does abortions in Louisiana, is in the hospital, said the Center for reproductive Rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all the other doctors in the state will be forced to stop performing the procedure, the doctor, fearing for their safety, would cease to perform this procedure, the group said.</seg>
<seg id="16">Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they will not punish doctors doing abortions as long as their statements on the power of waiting for the decision.</seg>

<seg id="1">The result of the introduction of quotas for domestic products</seg>
<seg id="2">Not less than half of products for each type of product in the range trading networks should be the Russian production, says Duma deputy from Just Russia, Oleg Nilov has informed about.</seg>
<seg id="3">The MP has prepared a draft law aimed at introducing protective measures for domestic manufacturers, the newspaper Izvestia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The document will still have some points, to avoid possible discomfort to buyers.</seg>
<seg id="5">This applies to goods that are produced in Russia. <... > As the rest of the groups of products, which are produced in Russia, should be to provide: Not less than half of their shelves domestic manufacturers, "Nilov has informed about.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Together with the amendments to the article of the Russian Federation," the bill provides for the introduction of changes to the Tax Code, laying down a 10% rate of VAT in Norway with the implementation of the products produced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea to introduce a 50% quota in -процентную trade networks included in the stimulus package for Russian producers.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the shelves there will be several times more than domestic goods.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, this initiative can have both a positive and a negative effect, say the experts.</seg>
<seg id="10">Attorney Налоговик ", a member of an independent expert center" Public Duma Sergei Litvinenko for the Russian economy, as well as for the agriculture and food industries, the effect will be positive in nature, and will lead to growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">The gallery will be key, farmers, small shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">They will be able to sell more, and that means that profits will grow.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms to retailers and prices, because they will be forced to buy their goods.</seg>
<seg id="14">Russian manufacturers will be able to increase the volume of its activities and sales, which would pay higher taxes than before.</seg>
<seg id="15">This will increase budget revenues, will create new jobs, any industry will begin to expand any faster осваиваться, will be introduced to contribute to the growth of GDP.</seg>
<seg id="16">Russia's reliance on foreign food fall several times, though not immediately, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="17">Earlier, Russian companies are often unable to fight their way on to the shelves of local stores due to higher competition from foreign counterparts.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now, after the introduction of an embargo, this niche gained freedom and can breathe a sigh of relief.</seg>
<seg id="19">But do not forget that, after all the necessary approvals and sanitary inspections to the Russian market will be available food from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="20">In other words, it is now a "moment of calm", when the players have already left, and the new has not yet come.</seg>
<seg id="21">Almost a month later, we can say the demand for Russian raw materials, as well as rising prices for finished products, "said Vice President АиФ.ru first all-Russian organization the Russian club financial directors," Tamara Kasyanov.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clearly, the idea to sell in each category at least 50% of the Russian food products will be the sector for local producers.</seg>
<seg id="23">In that case, they will be competing with each other, and not with goods that subsidies at the expense of another state, are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="24">In other words, the buyer will unfold between the companies working on one of the industry.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, says Kasyanov, Russian producers are able to meet 50% of domestic needs compatriots not on all items.</seg>
<seg id="26">And in this situation commercial networks will have to "дотягивать" share of Russian goods up to half of the range.</seg>
<seg id="27">In this regard, increasing fears that the forward will be available on the shelves.</seg>
<seg id="28">Perhaps, in the guise of produced in Russia, will be delivered to foreign products with перебитыми labels, "adds an expert.</seg>
<seg id="29">The impact of the introduction of quotas will feel large trading networks, especially those which выгодней cooperate with importers.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is logical that they will suffer and the foreign suppliers, because the demand for their products will decrease.</seg>
<seg id="31">Litvinenko did not rule out that the law on quotas on domestic goods may impact on consumers.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fact is that some of the Russian-made products can yield in the quality of imported ones, while shops will be boosting prices on the second as a scarce commodity.</seg>
<seg id="33">The single idea in the early 2000s import substitution economists started talking again in February this year because of the ongoing devaluation of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="34">Now, against the background of the difficult relations with the West, the question of the import of products becomes even more urgent.</seg>
<seg id="35">The law is designed to oblige suppliers to retailers in the formation of orders from domestic producers.</seg>
<seg id="36">Then we are much faster and more confident we will go on the path of import substitution, and the planning system to produce the necessary products in a shorter period of time, "says the MP Oleg Nilov has informed about.</seg>
<seg id="37">Especially effective mechanism will be staying for the agricultural sector, where the potential is especially high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.</seg>
<seg id="38">Our farmers are able to fully cover the shelves in Russian shops.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition, a powerful impulse, may receive aid and production.</seg>
<seg id="40">As is known, the biggest share of imports remains on offer - from 30% to 35%.</seg>

<seg id="2">Whether Russians feel a sharp increase in the price</seg>
<seg id="3">As a result, cross the Russian sanctions and the inflation accelerates in Russia and not in forecasts уложится, analysts believe, "VTB Capital."</seg>
<seg id="4">According to the experts, the delayed effects of the антисанкций will lead to inflationary ever in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the latest forecast, the Economic Development Ministry in 2014, inflation will be 6,5-7,5% the following year - less than the 6.5 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to the newspaper, "Kommersant," the commentary this week should make a "small but significant" changes in macroeconomic forecast up to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the publication, the agency might lower assessment of inflation in 2015, which will eliminate the expected progeSOFT revenue growth of the population.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the forecast, it was assumed that the Russian food sanctions apply a year - until August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">In such a situation, you could assume such high inflation?</seg>
<seg id="10">The current situation is a shock, but during понижательный trend of inflation will not change, "said a source working in the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="11">Economists from VTB Capital "is not shared by expectations that the government's forecast of inflation and unit price growth in 2014 at the level of 8%.</seg>
<seg id="12">The main effect of product bans will come together with the introduction of the regions of the Russian Federation in sales tax (GAP) in 2015, the experts are convinced.</seg>
<seg id="13">Inflationary in the peak of 9% in February, after which the annual pace of price growth will decline, some experts believe.</seg>
<seg id="14">By the way, last week brought the first inflation results Rosstat, Russia introduced a "neat sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="15">АиФ.ru interviewed experts and found out their inflationary expectations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Artem Деев, head of research at FC AForex:</seg>
<seg id="17">Already there has been a rise in prices for the main segments of goods.</seg>
<seg id="18">More than that, they appreciate products, the government was forced to launch measures of monitoring systemic risks to price stability, in order to prevent unreasonable price increases in the short term.</seg>
<seg id="19">Suppliers and retailers already report on a daily basis before the regulatory authorities, so that the authorities knew exactly who was where and for what reason will trigger an increase in prices.</seg>
<seg id="20">The key consumer price index growth continues to be tremendous pace of capital flight, excessive refinancing the banking sector from the Russian мегарегулятора, internal convert because of the flight of foreign currency, and also an embargo on the import of food from countries that joined the sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="21">If inflationary pressures remained under control, the cost of a minimum basket of products have not jumped 12% in only one quarter.</seg>
<seg id="22">A ban on the import of food products provoked shock proposals on the internal market and led to a higher cost of логичному.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because at this stage we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, and increase self-sufficiency of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production, no sanctions will continue to be part of the growth of the inflationary risks.</seg>
<seg id="24">If you include another and fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as ухудшенными prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year, inflation could exceed 8%.</seg>
<seg id="25">Alexander Разуваев, director of the analytical department "par"</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20 to 30% per month to zero, it was also higher than current levels, another thing that then it is offset by rapid economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="27">I think, at the end of the year inflation will be 8-8,5%.</seg>
<seg id="28">Plato Магута, managing assets of the Criminal Code, "the Fund Магута"</seg>
<seg id="29">An external factor associated with sanctions against Russia, while successfully contained, but if there is a further increase of the pressure, first of all, in the financial sector - this can lead to a certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations, which are traditionally in purchases of currency to protect their savings.</seg>
<seg id="30">It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance will try to smooth the weakening rouble, as methods and government regulation.</seg>
<seg id="31">But prices traditionally begins after a lull over the summer and, possibly, this fall will become more pronounced.</seg>
<seg id="32">The target level of consumer inflation in Russia to 7.5%, most likely, because Russian выстоит has another financial savings.</seg>

<seg id="16">It is no secret that, thanks largely to the госзаказу стройрынок develops.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the Chairman of the Board of the NP "expert opinion" Catherine Лезиной procurement professionals community, today the state is the most effective customer.</seg>
<seg id="18">The deputy director of the pharmaceutical industry ’ s capital construction Vladimir Малахов drew attention to the fact that, today, the market can be divided into the companies, which have access to a portfolio of contracts, and the companies that own монопольными competence and does not allow for this field of competitors.</seg>
<seg id="19">He believes that the creation of a transparent market is only possible when access to contracts will be as someone's manager of the Turkey is ready.</seg>
<seg id="20">The expert council was asked to form a government in such a way that one and the same performer may not receive more than one contract for more than $1 billion or more contracts for more than $1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="21">In минстрое believe that this approach must be evaluated from the point of view of the impact on the business, as well as construction management efficiency.</seg>
<seg id="22">As explained by Elena Zhukova, in this case, you will need to empower customer functions, which will lead to an increase in the number of budget and spending on its content.</seg>
<seg id="23">The customer will need to have the knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by contractors, as well as their security.</seg>
<seg id="24">Often with this by, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the security of an object as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of highly skilled players should be in connection with the Federal government order for part-time work and a small amount of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="26">The deputy head of the Institute of procurement экспертно-консультационного Alexander Евсташенков believes that the government is now in the business of the game as good as they possibly can.</seg>
<seg id="27">And this example: "A participant when completing the application must specify" specific performance "without the words" or equivalent "," should "," "," "more," "less than," "similar" "or", "type", "a similar type," "not," "lower," "higher," "can," "may," "could," "before", "no", not "higher," "not allowed" and so on.</seg>
<seg id="28">Thus, customers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of applications, of contractors.</seg>
<seg id="29">Another problem, according to 44-ФЗ Евсташенкова, was the need to assess the quality of the work of the "paper" proposal.</seg>
<seg id="30">An application by a participant, really can be assessed only a qualified contractor, but not the quality of the works, for which not even started, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="31">The quality of the works can be assessed only on their acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="32">The expert council also was asked to take a margin income from the top to the lower train had disappeared to intermediate contractors.</seg>
<seg id="33">The chairman of espionage, State Secretary, FAS Andrei Цариковский believes that it is not worth it, as responsible for the order should генподрядчик.</seg>
<seg id="34">But otherwise, as in the famous репризе of Arkady Raikin normalises sleeping: "Пуговицам claims to have?"</seg>

<seg id="3">The house since the 18th century buildings never changed, if not considered ветхость.</seg>
<seg id="4">People here go, on excursion, and residents are more than delighted, from his privilege - the right to live in the house, the walls of which Ufa старейшем remember Alexander Suvorov.</seg>
<seg id="5">The date of construction of the house amongst others, historians point to the two dates - 1730 and 1737.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in any case, it turns out that the nearly 300 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The old yard, always open the door, the squeaky staircase.</seg>
<seg id="8">The doors in the apartments are located near each other, the walls, the chair covers were cracked and peeling plaster просветы places visible from the street.</seg>
<seg id="9">It seems all the honest word....</seg>
<seg id="10">But local residents are told: "You don't think it is."</seg>
<seg id="11">To live in a wooden house of the 18th century is very difficult, "says Tatiana (1961, a resident of apartment # 3.</seg>
<seg id="12">The object is on госохране, but it does not allocate money to dozens of years, and we feel museum artifacts, which the authorities simply have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="13">The last renovation was 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The walls still худо-бедно stay, but the foundation of the entire прогнил.</seg>
<seg id="15">Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, and comes out from shower once a week in a public bath.</seg>
<seg id="16">How can you be content in such conditions?</seg>
<seg id="17">The road passes directly under the windows, even a pedestrian zone.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tatiana will put off behind.</seg>
<seg id="19">You can see now that, prior to this had only heard: Under the windows of the car rushes.</seg>
<seg id="20">You see, glass дребезжат constantly, can't open a window, and got used to the noise.</seg>
<seg id="21">A man gets used to the same, for good and bad.</seg>
<seg id="22">Our apartment is still a top, thanks to her husband, he has golden hands.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, two of the three of us, to live with her son.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for other families, the conditions are much worse on the second floor ceiling at a little more than one and a half metres tall.</seg>
<seg id="25">In contrast to Tatiana offers guests the roommate out of the apartment, No. 6 Lyudmila Старостиной.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nice friendly woman with threshold offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile said:</seg>
<seg id="27">We have a one-bedroom apartment, 14.5 m ² for four people, and we live with my husband and daughter, with her granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="28">I am here with the birth, another boundary was not never, "Lyudmila обводит eyes 3028-IV room: Sofa, two of the letter" g "; one of them was granddaughter with laptop.</seg>
<seg id="29">Very closely and are little different from the usual domestic interior: Only ceilings, beautiful "historical."</seg>
<seg id="30">But with the ceiling regularly flows: Tap system worn.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lyudmila says of his apartment and at the same time as, simply, the house which stands on the Roman ruins.</seg>
<seg id="32">It brings in a very old one, and the recent everyday and legendary:</seg>
<seg id="33">Water spent about 40 years ago during the last repair.</seg>
<seg id="34">Then we had a tiny kitchen and bathroom in закутке чулана from the former.</seg>
<seg id="35">We live just there where квартировал Demidov family lived on the second floor of the servant.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our apartment is privatized, and why?</seg>
<seg id="37">So they say in real estate, the privatization.</seg>
<seg id="38">It will get only apartment, can't apply for more.</seg>
<seg id="39">Already four months ago promised us расселить, but further promises to answer.</seg>
<seg id="40">And I won't complain.</seg>
<seg id="41">In this apartment (room!) lived for an entire dynasty: My grandparents, my mom and dad, I'm with my husband and my daughter, with her granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="42">Things happened during that time.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, здоровенные rats ran in the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="44">Look at the walls, they флигеля meters in thickness.</seg>
<seg id="45">They say the solution was involved in eggs, so long rests.</seg>
<seg id="46">The house built thoroughly Демидовым, thank you.</seg>
<seg id="47">Perhaps, but so far no one is killed with a ceiling or сваей.</seg>
<seg id="48">Only construction still slowly dying in front of us: Boards and home are rotting logs, floors have repeatedly failed, pouring cement, but all it takes is a solution to the earth, as well.</seg>
<seg id="49">They say and have, under our room the concealed лаз and move to the river White, who had once lived here, the old Believers to hide from danger, in which case....</seg>
<seg id="50">Persecuted them.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lyudmila NAME Stappel Allard Starostina said, came to him as a historian, he begged, he started to wield the excavations.</seg>
<seg id="52">And then urged to give them the house in exchange for its однушку in October.</seg>
<seg id="53">Lyudmila historian refused:</seg>
<seg id="54">Where are we in однушку вчетвером?</seg>
<seg id="55">And here at least a tiny hope is that will give housing more spacious.</seg>
<seg id="56">We agree on the exchange, would not have won.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, the family Старостиных nothing and not won.</seg>
<seg id="58">The biggest dream of Lyudmila to Suburban Region, and daughter gave his granddaughter of one 16-year-old from a separate room.</seg>
<seg id="59">The two families have identified two-room apartment instead of the majestic ruins, in which two generations living now.</seg>
<seg id="60">Pretty, Olesya Карсакова миниатюрная girl from No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.</seg>
<seg id="61">There close squeezed into airless apartments in two of 23 m ², apartments, lives her big family.</seg>
<seg id="62">We just seven people, two children.</seg>
<seg id="63">See for yourself, what conditions.</seg>
<seg id="64">Butt falls off with pieces of plaster and window frames, the walls in the kitchen, and the cross-cutting holes.</seg>
<seg id="65">The water in the кране only cold all year.</seg>
<seg id="66">Walking about the house, the old apartments, you can see that most of the spouses lucky Лаврентьевым No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="67">They occupy the most spacious rooms of the first floor.</seg>
<seg id="68">You are right, a lot of places.</seg>
<seg id="69">The 75 square, directed three people.</seg>
<seg id="70">We live in those rooms, where legend has it stopped the police during his stay in Ufa, the head of the family, "said Aleksandr Dmitrievich Lavrentyev.</seg>
<seg id="71">High ceilings, spacious.</seg>
<seg id="72">One bad - all around the train wreck that is collapsing, falling apart at the seams.</seg>
<seg id="73">Neighbors probably already told.</seg>
<seg id="74">The more suffering we have with floors, wooden boards сгнили, literally walked out from under the feet of the ground.</seg>
<seg id="75">I подпорки, wedges, anything in the room and, in another room, as we walk on a seesaw качаемся, so all of you.</seg>
<seg id="76">The merchant's house Евдокима Демидова Aleksandr Dmitrievich can tell you better than any guide.</seg>
<seg id="77">The золотопромышленнику refers to the native, speaks of it with admiration.</seg>
<seg id="78">Indeed, the personality and the owner was fantastic: Кагинского Узянского plants built houses, отливал guns and bells, kept Ural mines.</seg>
<seg id="79">Merchants take pride in an ancestor of the property, but to live under one roof with no longer want.</seg>
<seg id="80">I lived here as a child, in the 1940s, the 20th century, "said Aleksandr Dmitrievich.</seg>
<seg id="81">Then stood around the stables and wooden sentry boxes and, subsequently снесенные.</seg>
<seg id="82">In 1968, wanted to remove, and our home, but something prevented....</seg>
<seg id="83">Later in 2014: Поманили again with new housing.</seg>
<seg id="84">We, as a team, gathered all the necessary documents, обегали, and suddenly learned that moving to an apartment in 2015 or 2016.</seg>
<seg id="85">Something already doesn't believe in all this....</seg>
<seg id="86">Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan, to know the fate of homes.</seg>
<seg id="87">Officials of the occupier was not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="88">Sent from one desk to another, and then, as in mockery, issued without the signature of paper and printing: "The Ministry of Culture did not object to the resettlement of its residents."</seg>
<seg id="89">Even I have a feeling that our house is not in terms of the city since he was at number 57, then became 57 A, now 57 / 1.</seg>
<seg id="90">As if he had been demolished in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="91">"A planet" contacted the head of sector informational-analytical work management in Ufa Vladimir Барабашу.</seg>
<seg id="92">A house on the street of the October Revolution 57 / 1 is included in the resettlement of dilapidated housing.</seg>
<seg id="93">I can't be responsible for the actions of officials in the 1970s, only know that at the time there was a plan for the demolition of old buildings, despite the historical significance.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the authorities is to rebuild the old house on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value, "successfully.</seg>
<seg id="95">Tenants in the apartments are planned for the new расселить.</seg>
<seg id="96">According to Барабаша, restore Демидова House will be Italian experts who were involved in the restoration of buildings in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="97">Now Italy is architectural, and project "Old Ufa" presented there, among others.</seg>
<seg id="98">I hope that by 2016 all former Old Kazan Street will be the best Western Hotel Tigra was renovated, "said the official.</seg>
<seg id="99">Will the main house, which was earlier, three centuries ago.</seg>
<seg id="100">The house Демидова, is likely to become a museum, open to all comers.</seg>
<seg id="101">In addition, the government decided to make pedestrian street at the weekend.</seg>
<seg id="102">In everyday life, unfortunately, too much workload of roads in the city.</seg>
<seg id="103">People from the future museum расселить Vladimir Barabas promises in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="104">However, it is unlikely they will be: Their new apartments will be of the same area, and that the current....</seg>

<seg id="4">His father, who died when Henry was 19, he worked in a factory, and their relationship has been limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry репетирует comedy, "Редкие records Rudi," which is partially based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of programmes on Radio 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mix of 199.4 million euros and rap, and the melodies - жизнерадостны.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, Henry had to get through some difficult memories of childhood.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the death of his mother was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often mused about the relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was very inaccessible.</seg>
<seg id="10">You never saw his face, you only hear his voice: "Don't make noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Отстань from sisters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Шевелись!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch the cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were older, when I was a child, walked with him in the pub and talk about these things, as a form of beer glasses, the beauty of the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">I have not talked to him since.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was so неулыбчивым guy in the corner, who was reading the newspaper for most of my life.</seg>
<seg id="17">Henry recently opened the studio are in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in the days of his father, he was able to look at what must have been his life.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now there's a little bit better, but it's dark, дымные have depth of Hell, with outbreaks of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father залезал in a bathtub and just lay there, and you have heard, as he slowly begins to sing to myself, because he wanted the отмыться till from the shop.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I came back, I realised that he was doing it years and years to get us to the other, and I began to appreciate it more.</seg>
<seg id="21">However, Henry came out of childhood devoid of parental love.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never hugged, ever said, "I love you."</seg>
<seg id="23">Only when her mother became ill at the end of her life, we have to say, "I love you, I love you, I love you.</seg>
<seg id="24">The birth of her own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love that he lacked as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">You can stop it, "I love you"?</seg>
<seg id="26">Just don't hug me.</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I'm 22!</seg>
<seg id="28">With Dawn French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why would I not be friends with her?</seg>

<seg id="36">He was the one that killed her.</seg>
<seg id="37">So, when I was very, very recovered and I had symptoms of diabetes, and my doctor said, "You have to take radical measures.</seg>
<seg id="38">Then I began serious training фитенсом, and I also had to sit down on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="40">And that's boring.</seg>
<seg id="41">No one eats carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">A change of career trajectories of Henry reflected, perhaps, in his noble, briefly подстриженной beard....</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he received the recognition of critics for his Othello, he completely immersed in theatre.</seg>
<seg id="44">It was followed by "Комедия errors," and then "Заборы Огаста Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="45">This work is different from sitcoms and comedies that were неотъемлимым attribute his busy professional life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He began his career, when he was 16 and worked in a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">DJ noticed as he parodies on the stage, and wrote about it in "The new faces."</seg>
<seg id="48">His career in television began in the mid seventies: "Quite a long time I was the only black пародистом / comic on television."</seg>
<seg id="49">He was learning on the job.</seg>
<seg id="50">I not only had to grow up in front of the public, I had to learn how to be an effective vehicle for delivering jokes between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working in television, and it was very hard.</seg>

<seg id="52">As his manager had the rights to the show, "Black and white minstrels," light entertainment program, in which people "чернили themselves face," Henry found that is in it for five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">My family didn ’ t like it.</seg>
<seg id="54">I want to, like, this never happened to me, but I don't regret that I did it.</seg>
<seg id="55">Though it was a strange, worthy of condemnation, I worked on large venues and learned to work the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="56">But the fact that it was "a classic light entertainment awards given to years and years," and it was "a grotesque parody of black people."</seg>

<seg id="59">Commercials, documentaries, television series and roles in the movies: The ten years of his life, but, after his TV series on the BBC in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "what are you going to do next, Len, for a little while, it seems that you're тянешь сворачиваешь or quietly to the side."</seg>
<seg id="60">Next was a series of documentaries for Radio 4 called "What's good in...?"</seg>
<seg id="61">The first was about (0-9).</seg>
<seg id="62">I was a genuine allergy to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">We cannot say to me it's taught at school, and I thought that this is, in many ways, the prerogative of white middle class people with колготками and cabbage at the bottom of the front.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I was afraid of him.</seg>
<seg id="65">Everything, from whom we took in an interview, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Денч said: "You have to try.</seg>
<seg id="66">Not ругай it, until you know what you are talking about.</seg>
<seg id="67">24 aloud some of those words, and you will understand why we still love Shakespeare.</seg>

<seg id="71">"That's what it is, this is a serious case, Treat this seriously, your text style, a little research.</seg>
<seg id="72">So, the process of rehearsals was tough, and I read this play for months and months before we got her.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">It seemed that they were waiting for a disaster, but it has not happened.</seg>
<seg id="75">Soon we began "Комедию mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I was at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you have changed."</seg>
<seg id="78">There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that his job is to entertain the public.</seg>
<seg id="79">"The Pacific voice inside me said: 'You have to work 10 minutes while they чинят computer". "</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead, the assistant director, announced that the service will resume as soon as the problem will be solved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I walked away from the scene and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."</seg>
<seg id="82">It is not my duty.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can let someone else deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="84">"You play by play, stay in the role of". "</seg>

<seg id="90">So I держусь this.</seg>
<seg id="91">I really love it.</seg>
<seg id="92">I love being in the репетиционном hall.</seg>
<seg id="93">By the way, Henry is still thinking comic - all the way our conversation перебивают flashes his humor, when it starts, it finishes to parody.</seg>
<seg id="94">I just decided not to work in стендапе, because this thing with the instant gratification of a room full of strangers, I think, quite dangerous.</seg>

<seg id="99">This is his new incarnation?</seg>
<seg id="100">I think so.</seg>
<seg id="101">I like to be an actor.</seg>

<seg id="88">Though not like you very much.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was sorry her and because of the excessive brutality of his words, and because of fear, who appeared in her eyes when she gave him.</seg>
<seg id="90">Did she, that he hit her?</seg>
<seg id="91">She has not talked to him about life in the cold of the northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that, in basic terms, it was like a здешнюю.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same huge icy ocean to both of them.</seg>
<seg id="93">Those same half-distracted with men, even more sensitive and capricious after ВООБЩЕ IF THAT happened, happened, than their ancestors, smugglers and разрушители, shopped in fury from pub to pub, ready to raise a hand on any woman, посмевшую поддразнить or to deny them their....</seg>
<seg id="94">Amounts to pointless head?</seg>
<seg id="95">They showed her a fist, if it was not careful.</seg>
<seg id="96">Would be first kissed, kiss now became the most common erotic expression of irritation between a man and a woman; an antidote from fresh ballads, which Google is the first to kiss her, and then hit.</seg>
<seg id="97">Excessive clarification, according to Кеверна because the kiss itself was already хулиганством.</seg>
<seg id="98">Эйлинн Соломонз case showed, however, that he needs to leave.</seg>
<seg id="99">He rose from the lounger, as an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She herself felt the lead weight, but the weight of his grief surprised her.</seg>
<seg id="101">This was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They barely knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">She looked, as he goes, and out of an upper window was watching how he goes, her companion, a man, himself взваливший on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam, the garden, she thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">She felt a stab of sympathy towards him and men in general, even though some of them and raised her hand.</seg>
<seg id="106">The man, from the pulpit, отвернувшийся back пристыженный ’, and the ability to fight left him - why it seemed to her that she knew it so well, if she could not recall a single case, to this day, when she saw this?</seg>
<seg id="107">Again one Эйлинн Соломонз looked at their feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">For 20 years before the events described above or so Эсме Нуссбаум, intelligent and energetic 32-летняя исследовательница Офнау, which worked in "service", an informal control over Community mood, has prepared a report on the low and medium levels of violence in most parts of the country, where it was expected that it will be reduced, if not lifted entirely, given the means and the forces that were allocated to its eradication.</seg>
<seg id="109">"A lot has been done, and a lot is being done," she wrote, "to moderate the innate aggressiveness of people who fought in wars and won most of them, especially among children and narrow спутанных расселин area, where, despite hovering over изгородями spires of churches, gentle breath of human kindness was rarely in the history of the....</seg>
<seg id="110">However, some quality, it turns out, неискоренимы.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher the spire, it would seem, the низменнее those passions that he зарождает.</seg>
<seg id="112">The population of the sheds tears over the sentimental stories of drinking, skipping преодоленных obstacles and announces his enthusiastic international faith in the virtue of marriage and family life, however, not only the old rudeness retains its strong grip as in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is evidence that a new depth and an angry задиристость in homes, in the workplace, on roads and even in playgrounds.</seg>
<seg id="113">"You have досадная habit of writing too much," said her supervisor, having read the report as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="114">I think you should read shorter novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">Эсме Нуссбаум lowered her head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask you: You атеистка?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I think that is not obliged to answer," replied Эсме Нуссбаум.</seg>
<seg id="118">Are you lesbian?</seg>
<seg id="119">Эсме again insisted on his right to privacy and silence.</seg>
<seg id="120">Feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Again silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I ask," said Luther Рабиновиц, "not because I am against atheism, лесбийства or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">Here we have no prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="124">We are the servants of society without prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="125">But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely reasonable and a good in themselves, they may sometimes distort the results, such as those that you have shown me.</seg>
<seg id="126">It is obvious that you yourself предубеждены against the church, and what you call "malevolent" and "rude", others would be interpreted as an expression of natural healthy and intensity.</seg>
<seg id="127">About THAT THE INJURY нудеть continue to happen, IF ANY ВООБЩЕ happened, as if it had happened, if at all, has happened yesterday, it means depriving the country needed her life force.</seg>
<seg id="128">The Эсме Нуссбаум огляделась until Рабиновиц said.</seg>
<seg id="129">Over his head, and pink as gimmicks, led the letter repeated advice that "Офнау" gave the country the last quarter of a century or more.</seg>
<seg id="130">His neighbour, улыбайся energy of his spouse, listen to ballads, walk, talk on the phone, organise, talk, listen, объясняй соглашайся, извиняйся.</seg>
<seg id="131">The conversation is better than silence, word of the song better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I fully understand that you want to say," quietly replied Эсме Нуссбаум, when satisfied that her supervisor had finished talking, "and I don't want to say nothing, except that we not излечились as efficiently as we convince ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">I am concerned about is that if we do not, we will find that repeat mistakes that initially led to ТОМУ ВООБЩЕ IF THAT happened, happened.</seg>
<seg id="134">Only this time we выбросим their anger and distrust, not on the other.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Рабиновиц joined the tips of his fingers in a sitting.</seg>
<seg id="136">This gesture would mean an infinite patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"You go too far," he said, "calling" mistakes "actions that made or not made our grandfathers.</seg>
<seg id="138">You come too far and when talking about what they have put their "anger" and "mistrust" in the "other."</seg>
<seg id="139">In your place, people should not need always to remind that the understanding of the past, that is, in the present, we are not talking about "us" and "them."</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "us" and no "other."</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of turmoil - that's about all we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"For that, to be honest with ourselves," ventured Эсме insert, "no part of society may well justify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am not accusing anyone.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it's bad or good, what is done is done.</seg>
<seg id="145">Then it was back then.</seg>
<seg id="146">No need to say anything more - here we agree.</seg>
<seg id="147">And don't blame anyone, not excuses, and if this was appropriate, or if there was something you can fix.</seg>
<seg id="148">But why, if not to learn "</seg>
<seg id="149">New past to be forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I can add to that one word -</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther's Great Pyramid Рабиновица fallen apart.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I'll review your report", he said, by letting go of her.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, on the way to work, which left her knocked мотоциклист, on the sidewalk, passersby have described as "a vicious rage."</seg>

<seg id="2">Growth in the eurozone slowed to the lowest in 13 months in August, according to the study.</seg>
<seg id="3">The business index (PMI) for the eurozone manufacturing sector of the public fell to 50.7 in August, dropping from 51.8 in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">The value of the above 50 indicates growth.</seg>
<seg id="5">New orders and business opportunity, were among the growing tension between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The values were received before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Markets will wait for the bank from a clear plan of how to cope with a recovery in the eurozone, as well as the threat of deflation, with inflation of just 0.3 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi later this week may give further signals that he is contemplating a scheme of quantitative easing in the eurozone, similar to those that have used the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Although some growth is better than no growth, and the braking effect of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on manufacturers becomes more obvious," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at public.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany's PMI manufacturing sector, a major trade partner of Russia in the EU, has fallen to the lowest level in 11 months of 51.4.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the meantime, the bloc's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to an additional 46.9.</seg>

<seg id="14">The industry is most likely still would add fuel to the fire, analysts are anticipating the introduction of additional monetary or tax-based incentives.</seg>
<seg id="15">One positive piece of news was from Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since the end of 1999.</seg>
<seg id="16">Howard Арчер, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that can be said about the August survey index of business activity in the eurozone manufacturing sector, is that it shows that the sector is still growing."</seg>
<seg id="17">He added: "Eurozone manufacturers, obviously, are finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension - particularly associated with Russia / Ukraine, adds uncertainty still difficult conditions in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">This increasing tension, apparently hit by business - and especially on the confidence of consumers, and is likely to lead to the fact that some orders delayed or avoided, especially large orders.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said that "increasingly likely" that the ECB, in the end, of course, will have to conduct some kind of crumble, "although we suspect that it will be limited."</seg>

<seg id="82">He is not looking for revenge, for example, he did not just fixed on it in this last nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not like to remember it, but they are very close with six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and burn candles there.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember he was lying on the sofa, facing away from us, for hours.</seg>
<seg id="85">Did not sleep, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I also remember how he threw all their weapons and other military toys. Дамиру now 17, he is above me, nice, smart and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">To me it is hard to believe that a few hours I was so sure that he is dead and that I never see him no more.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I was able to recover from the explosion and rose to his feet, I огляделась, I saw hell around himself, when parts of bodies were lying everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely convinced that it is not possible to my little boy could survive in this hell.</seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember what I shouted to him:" Damir, Run, убегай ", but again I was so sure he had heard me.</seg>
<seg id="91">But he heard, and ran off.</seg>

<seg id="112">George says now: "It is important that this never happened.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I doubt that we ever learn the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">People continue to investigate this tragedy and will never know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">Now they investigate this collapse at Boeing in the Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Will we ever know what it was?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world is going to something very bad.</seg>
<seg id="118">"I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, no one wants a war, because it is happening?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing for this pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need to have a little bit of tens of years to forget it.</seg>
<seg id="121">It has affected my health, and I still feel it.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips, how to achieve a better quality of underwater photos and video</seg>
<seg id="2">If you want to take pictures or shoot video under the water, you have a number of options.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option, is a waterproof "Point and Shoot," for example, the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or, for example, GoPro Hero3 экшн-камера + Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I took these pictures on a family holiday with the help of a few cameras, all for the price of about $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">No matter what equipment you are using, you need to follow a few rules, in order to achieve the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Перепроверяйте your equipment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the case of the camera and other branches of the tightly closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, the camera for the type of photos or videos that you shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some cameras and camcorders shoot or object type is regimes that exposure to optimise затемненных underwater conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in the water, understand how deeply your equipment can fall.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some of the camera is only 5 feet, others - 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Look at our leadership and the ratings of digital cameras for both traditional and catalog models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Remove a few frames - because many of them never get.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Have essentially have" increased LCD that can help you, whereas your экшн-камер them usually don't.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have LCD, it will be difficult to see under the water, and the layout of the frame is a random process.</seg>
<seg id="16">So do a few frames.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also, if your camera is serial shooting mode, which takes several shots with a slightly different view, use them.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">The amount of light is significantly reduced, the deeper you нырнете under water.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, stay at the surface, when you're shooting in a swimming pool, a river or ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">It will also allow you to transfer more colour in photographs; the deeper you get you, the less you see color.</seg>
<seg id="22">Подплывайте closer to shooting.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is excellent advice for shooting on the land, but it is even more important under the water because of затемненных light conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is especially important if you're shooting on экшн-камеру: This equipment often is equipped with a fixed, широкоугольной Backwards, which means that you have to get close to it, if you want to fill the frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was such a man, whose force of personality could shake things around, even in such a giant organization like the National Health Service.</seg>
<seg id="2">Консультирующий such an attack, he dedicated his career needs of patients suffering from the disease and the treatment of remorse.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among those who spoke to him, recalls his wife, was an MI6 officer who had to live with devastating effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that as long as Dr. passionate about being diagnosed diseases and treatment for those who are mainly concerned about something completely different - the pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, however, he found himself, who began to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I did not feel, as usual," he wrote in May last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I found it hard to find strength in herself.</seg>
<seg id="8">Struggling with symptoms similar to flu, he found that his wife Джулиет reproaches irritably.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want all happened sooner rather than later," he said.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Джулиет went on for a week, Lawson found that unusual and it is not clear why he was upset.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked a colleague to chest X-rays.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks before he went skiing in the French Alps.</seg>
<seg id="14">The results of the X-rays came.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was mesothelioma, a terminal cancer, which affects плевру shell, or lungs.</seg>
<seg id="16">For most cancers, it is difficult to determine an exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although some people became ill with cancer of the lungs, for example, not all cancer patients smoking lung.</seg>
<seg id="18">But with mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases the cause is contact with asbestos, волокнистым construction material, who once called a "miracle," but which, as we now know, mortally dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us is disease mesothelioma, which can be not to pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos, after all, is the stuff from the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in the UK since the 1960s, when these industrial ban came into force.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even when it has been used, only people from specific sectors worked in close contact with him: Трубоизолировщики, builders, carpenters and employees of a download, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">Industrial toxin from another era, he is hardly cause for concern today.</seg>
<seg id="25">But such a calm.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it turns out, is now at the peak of the epidemic мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="27">Here мезотелиомы dies from more people than in any other country on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="28">The annual death rate at about 2500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease than as a result of road crashes.</seg>
<seg id="29">The annual number of deaths from мезотелиомы since 1980 and projected the number of deaths in the UK in the future</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason we feel its deadly consequences right now, is that, although the use of asbestos it is illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), for the development of мезотелиомы are usually tens of years.</seg>
<seg id="31">And attack мезотелиомы is not limited to veterans of specialties.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was and, in many cases, remains in the house where we live, where we work, schools, where we learn, and shops, where we go shopping.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention in class, the level of prosperity, profession or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">Избранности bastions of fashionable London department stores, before the private schools, as it turned out, not salvation.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parliament building is riddled with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even hospitals, which are meant to treat us, turned out to be reservoirs of this fatal a carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was not трубоизолировщиком.</seg>
<seg id="39">In fact, he had to think about where he could enter into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he realized.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It seems that there could be a lot of asbestos in tunnels in the hospital Guy, where I spent six years on an internship," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">All are students, nurses, doctors and грузчики - used these тоннелями.</seg>
<seg id="43">I wonder how many of my peers expect the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">It was a question, to which, unfortunately, he was able to give a partial response.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Of the four doctors, who in the hospital and Guy have subsequently developed mesothelioma for the past five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I alone remained alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us expect this disease?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Лоусону was diagnosed with mesothelioma, "" when he was 48 years old.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">To live so long.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty percent of patients die from mesothelioma eight months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">She always lethal.</seg>
<seg id="52">So, now, we can only repeat Лоусона question: "How many of us expect this disease?"</seg>
<seg id="53">According to a leading expert in the UK, Professor Julian мезотелиоме Пито, most likely assume that the years between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain should изжить himself, by a man about to die.</seg>
<seg id="54">Now most are not, and that will die in this way.</seg>
<seg id="55">Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada with</seg>
<seg id="56">A quick review of reports from the halls of the court, where victims are often seek compensation, shows how far мезотелиомы spread attack.</seg>
<seg id="57">In June, for example, Marks & Spencer acknowledged that the three Джэнис Ellen contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, wildfires clothing departments at two sites, one of which was the store on Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs Ellen was only 18 years old, when she started working at M & S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now her two children are older than 20 years old.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Before this happened," she says, "I had never heard about мезотелиоме, I barely knew about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="62">And in my head I could not come to that, it will affect me.</seg>
<seg id="63">Few people really know a lot about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="64">In fact, asbestos is not one substance, and a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">They get their name from the word "асбестиформ", which means the fibrous structure, which tells them the strength and flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="66">Of those six, three were often used in the construction.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotile asbestos, widely known as white, more often found in other buildings today.</seg>
<seg id="68">It has been used in roofing panels, напольной thermal insulation, boilers, pipes and toilets, even the brake колодках cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">He смертелен less than other forms of asbestos, but still recognised by the European Union and the World Health Organization is "a source of serious health damage," which can lead to death.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, brown asbestos (амозит) and blue asbestos (крокидолит).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts suggest that "there are good, though indirect reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with mesothelioma [in the UK]."</seg>
<seg id="72">A worker was exposed to asbestos in the main store on Oxford Street, with London</seg>
<seg id="73">Джэнис Ellen may not have thought of themselves as a victim, but Julian Пито мезотелиомы work suggests that her story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that "a significant percentage of мезотелиом when there is no known exposure at work or at home, were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment."</seg>
<seg id="75">Most of the time, he says, is "normal" and the impact of weather on our building.</seg>
<seg id="76">No one, it seems, can't be sure that he is safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">The report Goddard Consulting, which was Westminster Palace, demonstrates how people, even in the heart of the government, could be exposed to unconsciously.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009, Goddard said that technical mines and pipelines for the premises of parliamentary committees were infected with deadly asbestos fibers, which could have given in the movement, something so harmless as "strong currents of air."</seg>
<seg id="79">Members of the parliament often blame the fact that they are pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.</seg>
<seg id="80">Although the Agency for maintenance of Parliament insisted that Westminster Palace received a "clean bill," and now she recognized that it is necessary to work on the £1 billion for the reconstruction of the Parliament, by upgrading electrician and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, members of parliament, will meet in the conference centre close to their fertility rates collapse, not on the green benches was....</seg>
<seg id="81">The report Goddard said that "the situation with the asbestos was not in accordance with the various rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">It is impossible to know whether this error management cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All we can do is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">One of those who failed to reveal their exposure to asbestos - it cost Graham, general practitioner.</seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson, cost, 50, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I was working at the hospital, which has successfully brought claims associated with asbestos," he says, "But I can't prove that, in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It's so hard to remember all the places where he worked, and the date.</seg>
<seg id="88">He remembers clearly the day in early December 2009 when his wholly overcame something that was like the flu.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly were shaken as me.</seg>
<seg id="91">It started very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terrible.</seg>
<seg id="93">I thought I can't drive all the way to homes.</seg>
<seg id="94">As a doctor, we knew that the pain comes from, including checking for iframe loads, wrapping around the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="95">However, like Джэнис Ellen, he just did not have reason to suspect мезотелиому.</seg>
<seg id="96">In the end, he could not walk to work a month.</seg>
<seg id="97">Operation doctors were doing chest x-rays and put плевральные катетеры to suck the fluid out of the lungs and send it for analysis.</seg>
<seg id="98">And yet his condition оставлось without the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">Gradually, his health has improved, and he went back to work.</seg>
<seg id="100">But from time to time the same symptoms return, often after he was involved in sport, and he breathed heavily.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, one of the patients came to him in the office – resonate grimly with similar symptoms, and he was later diagnosed with mesothelioma. "..."</seg>
<seg id="102">But even then we are not linking this with his own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">In the end, it was the patient for dozens of years older and worked with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">The connection was obvious in this case.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011, the state has worsened again – resonate grimly, and listened to his doctor showed him the results of the CT and X-ray images of the group.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, just two years after we started to feel ill, sensor, equipped with a camera, was introduced into his chest cavity between the shell, and the shell of his lung.</seg>
<seg id="107">I'm an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I usually just go further, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="109">I'm not too upset about it, to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife, has experienced.</seg>
<seg id="111">The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year, "they told me that this is mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham: Cost of mesothelioma diagnosis</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly we sank in meeting with Macmillan nurses, one of which suggested he contact a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">It was then that he realised the scale of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turns out that asbestos is widely used, especially in large public buildings, and where quite often there was asbestos once on the pipes," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, now succumb to the disease.</seg>
<seg id="117">Thus, mesothelioma now affects more young people below.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous asbestos pipes isolated in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely that affected patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees, who were on the pedestrian tunnels connecting nearby landmasses can bring together to get from one building to another (as Andrew Lawson), or eat in canteens basements (how often did we Graham) almost certainly really were exposed to toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">For several decades after the war, as it turns out, the hospital was a place where, in theory, legalistic поциентов for life, but the place, which constituted a threat to life for doctors who treated them.</seg>
<seg id="121">It still continues to remove today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students set their burners Бунзена speaker stands on asbestos</seg>
<seg id="123">And it's not just hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and мэриях due to their amazing and fire-resistant insulating characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="125">The schools, too.</seg>
<seg id="126">In fact, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the classroom for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="127">Across the country, to the countless lessons, students set their Бунзена burner on asbestos speaker stands.</seg>
<seg id="128">There were websites highlighting the problem of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as floor tiles or roof сараев usually contained asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"This is an industrial poison in a huge number of our buildings," says Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Лоусона in a case against the hospital Guy.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case the only contact, the woman could remember was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So be careful, снося garden sheds.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effect of the diagnosis, when we know that the disease is incurable, is huge.</seg>
<seg id="134">"To realize it, is quite a lot of time," says Graham cost.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to continue, but realized that I could not focus on what I'm doing.</seg>
<seg id="136">I spent two weeks in surgery.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I realized that I would have to go out and deal with them.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I did not meet Christmas</seg>
<seg id="139">One of the most difficult things was the transition from doctor to patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">As countless patients before him, he remembers, was confused as the amount of information that had to be taken.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was difficult to understand," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked my doctor," How much do I have time? "</seg>
<seg id="143">I had about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember, as I thought, "Well, I'm not a Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's all. "</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, as it is the mechanics of how we are in life, "the very act of breathing, raises cancer, which kills.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most of the cases of мезотелиомы caused by contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos is composed of tiny fibers.</seg>
<seg id="149">When asbestos is being destroyed and the carcinogenic fibers, they can get stuck in плевре, shell.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibers are annoying плевру and can cause mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem is due to the inhalation of asbestos fibers of the needle," Professor Tom Трежер кардиоторакальный, surgeon, who came to the hospital in 2001, Guy.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is the hospital, where Andrew Lawson, as suspected, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="153">Трежер Лоусона knew and had treated some of the others who, perhaps, was exposed to while in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">When иголочки asbestos in the lung tissue, "says Трежер unload their breath on the periphery, where the shell.</seg>
<seg id="155">It is, in its essence, invasive process from the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="156">Conventional treatments of other forms of cancer is much less effective at мезотелиоме.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is controversial.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some think it is worth trying.</seg>
<seg id="159">Трежер disagrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">"You can't cut плевру," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">It is good with a knife.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, this cancer chemotherapy is "not very well", which "acts", but not people.</seg>
<seg id="163">"From time to time there are patients who live a long time," says Трежер.</seg>
<seg id="164">But in the end, they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some patients are living much, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">Writer Stephen Jay Гулд died 20 years after he was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years after diagnosis, Graham cost continues to fight.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he became ill, mesothelioma – resonate grimly acquainted with Andrew Лоусоном, which, four years after diagnosis, single-handedly turned into offices of support and advice for patients.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Yes, Раковая Central," he said cheerfully, as they are called....</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," says cost.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was diagnosed with four years ago, and he still is very energetic.</seg>
<seg id="172">First Эбботту offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and would have prolonged his life only a month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was in despair," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, "managed to a more positive agenda."</seg>
<seg id="176">Meeting with several specialists, we decided to continue treatment with Professor Лоиком Ланж-Лаздунски institutes. At the hospital, Professor Guy.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had the advantage that I don't need it, I just called them and they took me," admits Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">Likely the patient would have to get the direction and approval for funding.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money plays a decisive role for patients with mesothelioma, to get the best available treatments.</seg>
<seg id="180">But when such treatments become ineffective, finally, inevitably, many patients still face a financial reason for concern "about the future of the families that they would leave.</seg>
<seg id="181">And then they ask the courts for compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan, of Field Fisher Price Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It has been known that asbestos is harmful to health, in 1898," said Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But that changed in the 1960s, is that it became clear that even very small amounts can put their health at risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">It was then spoke about the bad faith of companies.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and hospital Guy, ultimately, resolve the case, but it was not "the full cost of the settlement," according to Morgan, as Lawson could not clearly prove that his mesothelioma was the result of exposure to asbestos at Guy Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation into his death, hospital spokesman Guy is confirmed, however, that the "asbestos in its basement, mentioned above, was removed in the 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="188">It was too late for Andrew Лоусона.</seg>
<seg id="189">How to remove asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">In fact, tie a contact with asbestos to one company or place of work - usually through dozens of years after that, it turned out to be a big problem for patients with mesothelioma, demanding compensation.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have the owner or shut down.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance archives could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who are protected from lawsuits, knows that time is on their side, plaintiffs have, of course, no.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, this year took serious new legislative acts which facilitate patients with mesothelioma compensation for the recovery of their former employers, even if it is impossible to track down.</seg>
<seg id="195">In accordance with this law, was £350-миллионный fund of funds, which is financed by the insurance industry, for those who had been diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove to the contact, but who are not with whom to sue.</seg>
<seg id="196">In such cases, patients will receive 80 percent of the amount that the court could award in a case about the compensation of about £120000.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful claims under this scheme is expected to be every year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with mesothelioma, believes that the £350 million represent a "very good work" for the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"This is the deal, insured for insurers," he says, hinting that the sum is a quarter of that, insurers would have to pay, if not intervened time and patients with mesothelioma could track the company and file a lawsuit in the usual way.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even Mike Пеннинг, formerly the minister of labour and pensions, acknowledged that the law "imperfect."</seg>
<seg id="201">But Пеннинг, and Morgan acknowledged that, with seven people die every day, rapid action was needed.</seg>
<seg id="202">"People suffer so much, and they need help now," said Пеннинг during the second reading of the Bill about мезотелиоме in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">By the time Graham cost was in the hands of Professor Лоика Ланж-Лаздунски 19 months.</seg>
<seg id="204">After the initial consultation Ланж-Лаздунски recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Трежера, he believes to be effective.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was followed by радиотерапия тритерапия and chemotherapy - in which the entire Ланж-Лаздунски boasts 40 per cent of patients surviving for five years.</seg>
<seg id="206">We felt a surge of strength.</seg>
<seg id="207">"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says cost.</seg>
<seg id="208">You see these patients all the time.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is a force that supports you.</seg>
<seg id="210">When сдаешься, condition can deteriorate very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham went to the cost of the operation in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">By the end of August he finished the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">The scan showed no trace of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had a scan in March [2014].</seg>
<seg id="215">There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I just had to be fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="217">This is not a threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="218">This is the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="219">And once again we went through six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now there is no trace of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="221">However, this process is both physically and emotionally heavy.</seg>
<seg id="222">You can think about practical things - about finances, and when I die, for example, or about the fact that we need to show his wife, works as a timer to бойлере.</seg>
<seg id="223">When you get bad news, you become безрадостным.</seg>
<seg id="224">You need to look forward.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose their leaders; protesters promise revenge</seg>
<seg id="2">China's parliament decided Sunday to not allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reforms.</seg>
<seg id="3">Such a move would likely mark the beginning of a long time ago being protests in Hong Kong as activists have begun planning and mobilization in a matter of hours after that statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the 11th National People's Congress, in fact, communist leaders to remove all the candidates not loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's not обмануло our expectations, but still leads in rage," said lawmaker Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's not that Beijing had promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">They lied to the people of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defending the decision of China, Li Fei, the deputy general secretary of the Standing Committee of the 11th National People's Congress, said that to allow national elections to Hong Kong's leader would be too "erratic behavior."</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing promised to allow residents to vote by the head of the government, starting in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">Chinese leaders have made the decision as a democratic step forward, since it gives a direct vote гонконгцам right; however, the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process in its hands with the help of the Commission on the appointment of candidates, rigidly controlled from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, according to a new article that only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision was taken after the summer, when there have been some of the most extensive and unprecedented protests in Hong Kong for many years.</seg>
<seg id="14">After a big part of the campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, which threatened to cut off the financial district in Hong Kong if Beijing does not guarantee of universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday night, several hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central gathered in the rain to Hong Kong government headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="16">The organizers of the demonstration said that their movement is shifting to a new phase of civil disobedience and that they rise up on the waves of protest in the following weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, they have not reported the details, obviously, to avoid problems with state authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In онлайн-заявлении, the organizers said the movement "обдумывало any capture of the central district only as an exceptional measure, action that can be taken only if all the possibilities of the dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We regret to inform you that today, all possibilities have been exhausted and the seizure of the dialogue will take place.</seg>
<seg id="20">Authorities in Hong Kong were preparing to Beijing a few days, and on Sunday the government had strengthened security measures involving police and barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">The unrest is the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their own city.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of residents from mainland increases competition in the area of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement, saying that his demonstration to jeopardize the businesses - the lifeblood of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protest, which they say, it can lead to great economic damage, depending on how many people will participate, and for how long," said lawmaker Regina Yip, who has long been critical of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="26">We don't want to spread concern about the fact that Hong Kong is getting out of hand.</seg>
<seg id="27">This view, which is harmful for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chinese state media have also reported in recent days, activists of the democratic movement in Hong Kong which they were considering Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral law, which drew 7th - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.</seg>
<seg id="30">In July tens of thousands came out to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists brought up the issue of race and the conduct of the police after Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">A police officer was killed in Фергюсоне, Missouri, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">Coming raise hands, chanting: "Hands up, don't стреляй" while they wait in line in the....</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Missouri, Фергюсоне, associated with the murder of teenager Michael Brown, blogger безоружного зоила Miriam Perez noticed the shift in интернет-разговоре among white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">In her experience, the white feminists, men comments put gender above race, when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, as the tension grew in the Midwest and attracted national attention, Peres saw the white women who focused 100 percent on the race.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared with the reaction of black women shortly after the killing on 9 August, personal essays with such titles as "thoughts about Фергюсоне from white women" and "Феминизм is not only about the example of women" came relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Perez, they demonstrated a significant shift.</seg>
<seg id="9">"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who are talking about white skin and Privileges on such a high level," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People feel the need to say something about what has happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is a very symbolic for the crisis with which we are faced, and because of the situation in Фергюсоне) is so tied to race, they feel that at this point.</seg>
<seg id="12">For Professor of English at the University of Ohio Кориты Mitchell Ferguson has laid bare problems that blacks face every day, but one which is not perceived as a "women's problems" in the cultural sphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can write something funny on Facebook about what is going on with me and my partner, and get 150 лайков from everywhere," says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">When I write something about how the colored people are under assault in his own country, silence Duper.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Why are women so to speak publicly about the relationship, but not about the security in the public sector?" She asks.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women, like Mitchell, who studied questions of race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between matters relating to race and gender.</seg>
<seg id="17">From her point of view, blacks, women are in a position to clearly separate the problems; they are faced with a complex reality every day.</seg>
<seg id="18">At the time, as white women now bring together issues of race and gender in feminist мейнстриме, Энджела Хэттери, professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that its predecessor did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 1865 and 1890 линчевали for years, at least 10,000 black men, and it is almost always served as the rape of white women," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="20">Need a white woman, Ufa in the story to justify линчевание.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the point of view of Хэттери, the gap between white and black women, white суфражистки occurred when, for example, Susan B. Anthony looked at the situation in the late 1800s, and saw that the fight for suffrage will be effective only for one of the groups: Women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They have decided to lay down all the eggs in the basket voting rights for women, and the right to vote for blacks was to appear later," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="23">Look back on things like this gives us a clear idea of why colored women don't trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have not done anything good.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to white women united against mob lynchings in the South during the Women's Association to prevent mob lynchings.</seg>
<seg id="27">The group appeared nearly 40 years after the first was asked to help blacks, women, said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mitchell, from the point of view of the reactions of white feminists on the issues raised in the conduct of the police, "Фергюсоне, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white a feminist had to" catch up "with blacks, women cope in several generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"It is true, it would be well if the female, which have such a [traditional феминистическая] ideology, so the law would seriously raise the child as they relate to the right to contraception?" Asked Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="30">The second wave feminists who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to контрацептивам, now are beginning to understand what that means.</seg>
<seg id="31">Known white activist Gloria Стайнем феминистического movement in two weeks after the killing of Michael Brown took advantage of Фейсбуком and published a sharp колумнистки Rebecca Carroll, Guardian article which claimed that white Americans were more participation in protests on issues of racism.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope that women who have a similar, but there is another reason to understand the danger of the body," and the point of view of the racial problems that are substantially different in surveys of the public - will be at the head of the change, "wrote Стайнем.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Стайнем guarantee for more пересекающийся feminism, which includes and issues of race and gender, her comments about race in America still are surprised by some.</seg>
<seg id="34">The American entrepreneurial Institute researcher Christina Соммерс, author of "Who stole feminism?," she said She The People, that young men of color in the United States, especially young people, "is much more vulnerable than their sisters," but Стайнем Фергюсоне contradict the negative criticism, which she expressed earlier.</seg>
<seg id="35">We now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women, but almost nothing for the boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, when the White House recently initiated a program, "Сторож my brother" to help the vulnerable black and испаноговорящим young men, followed the US changed remarkably from many feminists, including those from Gloria Стайнем.</seg>
<seg id="37">Police relationship with the black community is not the only problem, продвигающая best line of traditional feminism.</seg>
<seg id="38">After U.S. immigration officials arrested during 1994ñ2001 unaccompanied minors about the southwestern border of the country this year, immigration reform came to the surface again, this time as a women's problem.</seg>
<seg id="39">Andrea Меркадо, co-chair of a singularly ineffective policy, the organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to make this issue as important for women, it was just to share stories of immigrant women.</seg>
<seg id="40">"They speak for themselves," said Меркадо.</seg>
<seg id="41">When the vast majority of working visas are issued [иммигрантам-мужчинам], women who come to them, find themselves in a position, vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="42">"These stories will resonate with women's organizations," she said.</seg>

<seg id="2">This week the government would contribute the Economic Development Ministry in a comprehensive plan for the development of clean vehicles in Russia, told the deputy director of the Ministry of Oleg Плужников the Round Table, which held the newspaper Vedomosti declared in Moscow - 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">The plan is drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals - reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is expected that the document will be passed in late September and early October, says the proposed measures concerning Плужников, electric cars and hybrids - a plan for the development of vehicles on газомоторном fuel in Russia already have.</seg>
<seg id="5">(A copy of the plan by Vedomosti is designed for 2014-2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">To develop assessment criteria electricity and hybrid vehicles and decide how to promote the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">A report to the government, the tax and customs measures quality support, will be prepared by December 2014; concessional lending scheme and preferential leasing will appear by April 2015, and proposals to reduce the prices of cars, and encourage the creation of service the infrastructure will be developed by October 2015</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014-2015, it is expected to make changes to regulations to ease conditions for the construction of the infrastructure charge (parking, petrol stations etc.).</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, federal officials plan for 2015 to formulate proposals for regional authorities, as well as to promote the use of clean transport - in the form of the benefits of the move and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and proposals on the expansion of the government purchases of such transport.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, the Economic Development Ministry already by October 2014 will depend on the evaluation of the activities of the regional authorities of criteria that reflect the effectiveness of the support for the production of clean transport, the development of the infrastructure charge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Vehicle market in Russia, while only formed in 2013 across the country sold about 100 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the start of the 2014 обнулена import duty on electric cars, so sales will be approximately 500 pieces, predicts, the chief executive of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey wife.</seg>
<seg id="13">But 56 does not any obvious: Electric cars in Russia in 2013, according to the Association of European Businesses, sold 2,78 million cars and light commercial vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="14">While electric cars in Russia imports only Mitsubishi Motors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Start import is preparing Renault - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says director for strategic planning and partnerships in Russia Renault Nicolas Ремиз.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most other manufacturers of electric transport took in respect of Russia taking a wait-and-see approach.</seg>
<seg id="17">Vehicle development and Russian manufacturers GAZ directors "," ",", "but the trivial.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in January - July 2014, according to the "АСМ-холдинга," Avtovaz has issued 30 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="19">Demand is also degrading because of soaring prices, admits director of AvtoVAZ engineering Sergei Аманов, without state support the breakthrough in this segment will not...</seg>
<seg id="20">The development of the Russian market, in addition to the new electric cars (those electric cars that are sold in Russia, on average, twice as much as analogues with internal combustion engines) holds an underdeveloped infrastructure charge (retails sites - units), "sighs Автостата general Sergei Целиков.</seg>
<seg id="21">Because of the high cost and low rate of electric cars in the next 3-4 years remain нишевым segment of the Russian market, "said chief editor Mikhail Подорожанский Авторевю Целиков, agrees with him.</seg>
<seg id="22">Car manufacturers, in contrast, say that some models are close to the cost of a conventional vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Russian market between good prospects, the important thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "real" электромобильность; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of the new charging stations, president of BMW's Wolfgang Шлимме.</seg>
<seg id="24">Such infrastructure projects, for example, is the "Россети": In Moscow several stations, soon there will be about 80.</seg>
<seg id="25">Talks about building a network of retails sites is underway and with other regions.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to the director of the department "Россетей" Vladimir Софьина, the company believes the market is ready to build electric and gas stations across the country, but there are problems: A small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging different brands.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, "Россети" as the Company does not have the right to engage in the sale of electricity, the ability to do this in relation to charging.</seg>
<seg id="28">Wife says the most effective measure of state support for vehicle market in Russia progeSOFT customs duties.</seg>
<seg id="29">Zero rate will act before the end of 2014, the possibility of its renewal, expansion of the preferential list.</seg>
<seg id="30">The transportation tax to environmental (the idea is being discussed and concerns all machines), too, will support the market, but not as noticeably as customs preferences, says wife.</seg>
<seg id="31">Vehicle tax in Russia is small, said Pankov, unlike, for example, from Norway, where the reduced tax rate led to a sharp increase in electric sales - now they account for 12% of the market.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, and the need for stimulus measures, such as free parking in the centre of the town (as has been done in Moscow), I am sure Pankov, or any movement of dedicated lanes for electric cars, which are not yet in Russia.</seg>

<seg id="6">On the night of August 29, the White House said that President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel discussed the possibility of additional sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The weakening of the ruble is long-term in nature and, in tandem with the euro, and in tandem with the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="8">The long-term forecast assumed that mark, "says senior analyst" par "Anna Bodrov's.</seg>
<seg id="9">All of that has to do with Ukraine, that will be reflected on the courses.</seg>
<seg id="10">As long as this continues, investors will react.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, rumors about the invasion of troops not confirmed nor on the one hand, but the market was very emotional.</seg>
<seg id="12">All the talk about the fact that he has been stable for such news, yesterday were перечеркнуты.</seg>
<seg id="13">A week, according to forecasts, will be closed around these levels - 36,90 37,05 and the ruble to the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="14">The tax period ended, oil prices, weak policies, sanctions, the issue of gas transit through Ukraine are all links in the same chain.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also, the forecast is for inflation to fall by end-2010 from 5 to 10%.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon, by the end, seasonal vegetables and fruits, and there will be a vacuum, so long as the network переориентируются on other suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The dollar went up to 37 roubles, went through it and came back, some kind of a hysteria," said head of markets "Broker" Konstantin Bushuev.</seg>
<seg id="18">Still, will look at whether to impose the penalties, as promised, will meet NATO.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said the ruble weakened sharply after the tax season, then went to the news on Ukraine, the Central Bank said last week that, until the end of the year to a fully floating exchange rate and waives any currency interventions.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you look at the daytime wobble, it is no different from earlier in the month, all have spooked that mark in 37 rubles, "continued the analyst.</seg>
<seg id="21">And so, in terms of the turnover of anything powerful has not happened.</seg>
<seg id="22">Worrying times for the currency market were, I remind you that at the end of January, shows an increased demand for the currency, as well as a third of March, when the Central Bank отгрузил a record number of currency.</seg>
<seg id="23">In UFS IC see the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="24">First of all, the growth of revenue from export operations, as well as to increase the competitiveness of domestic manufacturers at the expense of more expensive imports, says chief analyst UFS IC Alexei Kozlov.</seg>
<seg id="25">Negative moments can be attributed to the cost of imported goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency to significantly reduce the attractiveness of the investment in the Russian economy, rising inflation pressures and, as a consequence, are the cause of more expensive borrowing money, which, in turn, slows down the development of the country's economy.</seg>
<seg id="27">If we talk about the stock market, the rouble depreciation smoothes over a fall in share prices, expressed in roubles.</seg>
<seg id="28">For example, the MICEX index during trading Thursday fell 1.67 per cent, while the RTS Index lost 3.27 percent.</seg>
<seg id="29">Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of reduction of indices due to the weakening of the ruble during the day more than 1.5%.</seg>
<seg id="30">The weakening of the ruble is an emotional character and a desire to buy the currency.</seg>
<seg id="31">In practice, gradually emotions go, but not at the price of the ruble partially or completely restore lost ground.</seg>
<seg id="32">"We believe, soon we will be able to see the value of the dollar and the Russian currency is near the level of 36 rubles to the dollar," said Alexei Kozlov.</seg>

<seg id="2">Восстанавливающаяся economy means more customers, the more sales and jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Account for taxes at the state and local level for companies across the country, moderately increased in the last year, which accelerated the recovery, according to a new study, published last week, and the company in the Washington area is no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">In the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion in the coffers of the state and local level in fiscal 2013, to 3.8 percent more than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tax burden on business in the state and local level in the past year has increased by 4.3 per cent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after overtaking each other years when smaller accounts, in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">State taxes, rose 4.3 percent, faster than the local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to the research, which was conducted by professional services firm, Ernst & Young and the taxation of the taxation policy group.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the tax revenue in the county, 56 percent, in taxes on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of tax revenue for Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia, with 28 percent, is the lowest in proportion to the amount of tax revenue from businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">To a large extent, is caused by the growth of tax revenues to the same level of the value of real estate companies, the researchers say, that raised property taxes by 3.7 per cent this year, after three years in a row, when the growth rate was less than 1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large proportion of those earnings in larger states, such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same thing is happening in the Washington area.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion property taxes at the state and local level in the past year, to $9.6 billion more than in 2012 - an increase of 4.2 per cent, compared with the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the return of the value of the property does not have a similar effect on the growth of tax revenue for the state and local level in Maryland, where the property taxes just more than one-fifth of the companies' tax bills.</seg>
<seg id="14">Virginia and the District of Columbia are paying about half the tax bills at the state and local level, in the form of property taxes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"What is happening in Maryland is that such a large part of its property tax base, particularly around the District of Columbia, belongs to either the government or nonprofit organization that does not pay property taxes," said Douglas Линдхолм, executive director of the Center on taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, Maryland is forced to rely far more on income taxes to pay for those services that exist in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent increase in tax receipts from businesses cannot fully explain the recovery of the real estate market.</seg>
<seg id="18">Income entrepreneurs also, it seems, are on the mend, according to this data.</seg>

<seg id="2">The group's debut album Royal Blood - the new hope of British rock, рок-дуэты synthesis of clubs straight to stadiums.</seg>
<seg id="3">The duo Royal Blood all year on the stage, but already has the nomination for the BBC, a tour opening spot for Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the New York concert from the doorframe Пейджа Jimmy.</seg>
<seg id="4">Their debut album, Leif even for a few months to release received 100 thousand предзаказов contract, and the issue lies in the portfolio will Warner Music.</seg>
<seg id="5">Given the present situation on the market, a musical плачевную situation of lambasted, because this is not about new Lana del Ray, or another сладкоголосом representative "of the new R 'n' B ', and about the appearance of the British duo быковатых, playing with volume and intensity, that the last time was in a couple of decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">In general, rates on the first album in connection with all вышеозначенными circumstances were especially high and it is quite justified.</seg>
<seg id="7">It took the duo, before it could prejudice isn't that quite so desperate and hairy metalheads, which flows the blood of kings, as they think, they have in the veins, too.</seg>
<seg id="8">It is, of course, primarily about the heroes of the last level of Led Zeppelin, and the great quartet, Royal Blood are shaken застоявшуюся blood of British rock, to a new level.</seg>
<seg id="9">To make predictions about the success of this enterprise until, perhaps, the thought of, but you can have something to say.</seg>
<seg id="10">A dozen songs, with a small уложившихся in thirty minutes - it's not so much a demonstration at the phenomenal gifts, how many sea and a powerful statement of intent.</seg>

<seg id="15">And this is not necessarily bad, on the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="16">The force of the Royal Blood in the fact that they do not claim the new Lennon and McCartney (rather too mark in successors Motörhead), but made numerous рок-дуэты инди-клубов from the ghetto.</seg>

<seg id="20">Heroes ретророка zero mistakenly with great difficulty in the postmodern paradigm, with huge reluctance to admit to itself not just эпигонами, and independent creative units.</seg>
<seg id="21">Royal Blood, now sound so heavily and the subsequent pressure that this successful драпирует some вторичность твердолобость and musical material.</seg>

<seg id="2">Amazon has just confirmed what said Information on Friday morning: Shopping online - and видеопродюсер and another a hundred other things - buys видеовоспроизведения streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).</seg>
<seg id="3">The news was a surprise, not because no one was waiting for that Twitch would be sold, and because of that, many expected that YouTube will be a buyer.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago, the sale of a billion for Twitch видеосервису Google looked completely finished, and this combination was a natural.</seg>
<seg id="5">Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set a goal to be потоковым service general nature - version of YouTube in real time.</seg>
<seg id="6">Instead, he quickly turned into a platform where gamers aired their внутриигровые moments; "YouTube for games in real time," according to Business insider.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Twitch.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Let's play," genre movies, in which всезнайки give (mainly old) games, as in "Таинственном theatre", already popular on YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="9">The fact is that YouTube is mentioned often as Twitch, so the news that YouTube is buying Twitch was without much interest, a classic example of a well-established technology companies, выкупающей potential competitor.</seg>
<seg id="10">It is a mystery why the deal with YouTube has failed, given that, reportedly, he was willing to pay not less than Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">All that we have at the moment is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmett work: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term objectives, and they want to help us reach them more quickly."</seg>
<seg id="12">Another secret, to be honest, this is an incredible success, Twitch.</seg>
<seg id="13">Снобам like me, who say that it will be better than watching him, it is difficult to understand the attraction to watch the games instead of in the hands of a joystick.</seg>
<seg id="14">It is one thing to look over his shoulder, at 3 a.m., while creeping through Resident Evil, another to look like some sort of an outsider gets 20 shots in the head in a row as Call of Duty.</seg>
<seg id="15">The game, which you can watch right now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so to watch them shoot, not controlling the angle of view, can be a recipe for headache, a worthy by Right.</seg>
<seg id="17">I agree that the high-speed passing, in which Роджеры Бэннистеры of our electronic age the whole game in record time, entertain.</seg>
<seg id="18">But if it is not about виртуозе game or humour, it is unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.</seg>
<seg id="19">But they know that skeptics like me?</seg>
<seg id="20">Twitch had 55 million unique visitors per month, and it is the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic.</seg>
<seg id="21">How Amazon works on this?</seg>
<seg id="22">It is difficult to imagine that Twitch свернется in Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube would simply absorb Twitch.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, Twitch is that with pleasure would have received any company: The crowd of young men, of whom dream of advertisers.</seg>
<seg id="24">As the head of the Twitch Шир, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming," and the channel has signs, even "ouch" as a kind of sport.</seg>

<seg id="2">Given that the cost of university textbooks for many students more than $1000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move to the second course, devised a clever way to reduce costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">He developed a system of how to take the books in the world, by offering them старшекурсников rated compensation that they delayed their sale.</seg>
<seg id="4">"My textbook on mathematical analysis, which usually costs $180 for the semester, I got $10 and" Chick-fil-A "cookies," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying in Ковенант College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The literature on the cost would be $430 last semester, he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He spent $120.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the Council of the colleges, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on books and supplies, however, students have a range of options to reduce these costs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Students often select online stores, and creative ideas such as the guests.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rent books is becoming more popular, allowing students to use a book during the semester, and often is significantly cheaper than buying them.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Нибо Инкорпорейтид", which holds more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of rental books has increased by half since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">Industry studies show that about a quarter of books in university book stores during the past spring semester were taken, said the vice president "Нибо" Trevor Meyer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Less than half of all books are purchased in university book stores, according to the National Association of the university's professional union shops. "</seg>
<seg id="13">Here's introductory course on the best ways to make a deal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Buying in online store</seg>
<seg id="15">Sometimes, if you will, the price of a new book may be one third from the one that you'll see in the university bookstore.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" Ron this, Bruce Edwards and Robert Хостетлера worth about $290 privately, but a new instance can be purchased for $239,99 site Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Buying used</seg>
<seg id="18">If you don't mind other people's notes or damage, second-hand textbooks are a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Mathematical analysis of" sold for $93,49 подержанном form on to Chegg.com.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Кэсэдей, 25, a fourth year student at the University of Бригэм Young, said that paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of the textbook "strategic decisions in the media: An understanding of the business side of the advertising business."</seg>
<seg id="21">The book sold for $48.</seg>
<seg id="22">Teachers, for example, the Ingrid Брейси, director of "without walls" College at the University of Massachusetts in Эмхерсте, offers to students with their professors, could use the previous editions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates are insignificant for classes.</seg>
<seg id="24">In such cases, the old editions can often be found for a very small share of the cost of the latest edition.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition to websites Amazon and Chegg, Half.com, "owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying second-hand books.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hire</seg>
<seg id="27">To take textbooks, you need to think, if you are good enough to deal with them, do not forget to return them and does not want to leave them yourself after the course is completed.</seg>
<seg id="28">You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, a student could rent a "Математический analysis" for a semester for about $20.</seg>
<seg id="30">Find out what the rules of the store, where you take the books, including any fines that you can write for the markings, underscore and damage.</seg>
<seg id="31">If you take a book, remember: If you do not give the book, fines may even exceed the cost of the new instance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Electronic books</seg>
<seg id="33">Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks is another option.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sometimes such books are actually hire as an electronic licence for a specific period for retailers, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Rent" on the site Chegg.com Mathematical Analysis for six months will cost about $61.</seg>
<seg id="36">Брейси says that students who study literature, can often find the most advantageous prices, as many of the classics can now be free, whereas literature on natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.</seg>
<seg id="37">No matter what, осмотритесь.</seg>
<seg id="38">Joe reports, 29, who is about to begin studies at the Law School, the ISBN number Пеппердин recommends the book to find out, as this will ensure that you are looking for it you text.</seg>
<seg id="39">Before the Internet, says reports, be sure to check whether a book is in stock.</seg>
<seg id="40">He дался this lesson is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="41">The book, which he bought, was postponed for four weeks, and, in the end, he paid the full price at the bookstore.</seg>

<seg id="39">Санкционное menu</seg>
<seg id="40">On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of specific measures to ensure the security of Russia, which is basically food sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="41">The country banned import of beef, pork, a by-product from meat and poultry, meat, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cheese, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausage and sugar syrups.</seg>
<seg id="42">Restaurants have begun jockeying seems with suppliers: Food prices have increased, we need to urgently seek counterparts from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="43">This will affect the most expensive restaurants with монокухней France, Italy, Spain, in which products supplied directly from the "maternal" countries.</seg>
<seg id="44">Общепиту had to re-organize and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="45">For example, when, at the beginning of 2014, the Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and the year before - the American and Canadian meat.</seg>
<seg id="46">In return, the suppliers of established supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="47">But sanctions лета-2014 proved to be far more serious.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the president's decree, which lifted the ban on Atlantic salmon and trout fry high dimension, milk, seed potatoes, corn, peas and onions social for replanting.</seg>
<seg id="49">The Italian phone hopes that sanctions may even смягчиться.</seg>
<seg id="50">As long as there is uncertainty in terms of restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="51">According to the company's "East-West", one of the largest suppliers of beverages, the proportion of imported products in the premium segment accounted for up to 70%.</seg>
<seg id="52">"Expensive restaurants will have to change the menu under the produce of local farmers and other countries," says Sergei Mironov, AL, owner of the agency "Рестконсалт."</seg>
<seg id="53">If the strong, for him it's not going to be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="54">But we have very little of these chefs, and for the development of a new menu may take two or three months.</seg>
<seg id="55">From the restaurant Brasserie Тригель "The Bridge" prepared: Refuse to pay 10-15% of dishes, even half of the menu - recycle.</seg>
<seg id="56">In restaurants with a mixed cuisine are starting to replace dishes, for example steak of beef - on marble бефстроганов, says Sergei Mironov.</seg>
<seg id="57">"The cheeses from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian cheeses and cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," lists the "East-West" Oksana Глибчук.</seg>
<seg id="58">Cream and milk products from Europe have counterparts in Russia and Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="59">Chicken from the United States may be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus, and salmon from Norway - salmon, семга семгой, those from Belarus and Chile.</seg>
<seg id="60">The absence of vegetables and fruits of European production may be at the expense of domestic manufacturers, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.</seg>
<seg id="61">According to Mironov, budget restaurants gear up for the network will be easier than премиальному segment: Hardly went to 16-year-old Italian mozzarella is able to distinguish from the Russian.</seg>
<seg id="62">Although it is difficult to have to establishments Ginza Project, he says.</seg>
<seg id="63">A dozen restaurants in the Ginza Project under different brands and with their menu.</seg>
<seg id="64">The replacement will take plenty of time, "said Mironov.</seg>
<seg id="65">In Ginza refused to comment, citing the absence of owners in the country.</seg>
<seg id="66">The owners of the Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine stress that products from the former Soviet republics ароматнее European</seg>
<seg id="67">But a lot of restaurants, and that sanctions are not affected.</seg>
<seg id="68">They include institutions with CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.</seg>
<seg id="69">"The Georgian kitchen no expensive products," says Хатуна Колбая Saperavi, owner of the Georgian restaurants and cafes "Vai мэ!."</seg>
<seg id="70">All cheeses for us to do in Russia, the basis of many dishes - chicken, exotic herbs we don't use. "</seg>
<seg id="71">In Колбаи establishments not yet removed from the menu of a single cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="72">Timur colon, owner of the restaurants "high-born N1" with Uzbek cuisine, sanctions also might alert: He will have to change not only the Norwegian of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="73">If Russia our owned imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we even win in price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="74">From the CIS can be cheaper to get engineering, Norwegian, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit.</seg>
<seg id="75">While that brought from Central Asia, far better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="76">The Uzbek tomatoes all know that they are delicious, sweet.</seg>
<seg id="77">The Spanish one doesn't say so.</seg>
<seg id="78">After the introduction of sanctions the catalogue of Uzbekistan Олимбой Артыков said that plans to increase export плодовоовощной products to Russia twice by 2016.</seg>
<seg id="79">Of its intention to replace the European imports in Russia almost immediately after the introduction of sanctions said Belarus and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="80">Restaurants now that responded to the request "Денег", also quite calmly respond to sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="81">McDonald's press service said that localization exceeds 85% and the network is working with 160 Russian suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="82">According to Tatyana Богдановой, Head of the Charles Bridge on work with suppliers, about 80% of the food network buys in Russia, although there may be temporary, with supplies of vegetables and rising prices for meat products that produce from the imported raw materials.</seg>
<seg id="83">In "Теремке санкционные" "products" in general were not more than 4%.</seg>
<seg id="84">"The sanctions have not and лапшичную Воккер."</seg>
<seg id="85">KFC, Burger King and "Крошка Картошка" on request "Денег" not responded, but other market participants said that the degree of localization of Burger King is substantially less than the McDonald's.</seg>
<seg id="86">In the absence of Norwegian fish рестораторы ready to buy rather than an end, glad to present you our excellent Russian</seg>
<seg id="87">At its горбуше</seg>
<seg id="88">Meanwhile рестораторы complain that because of increasing demand, prices are rising even on local products.</seg>
<seg id="89">"On products for" sticking "prices increased on average by 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant" Cherry M & E "- two times," said AL Roman Рожниковский.</seg>
<seg id="90">Even Georgian restaurants in the cost of food will rise by 5-10%, concedes Колбая.</seg>
<seg id="91">"East-West" denies this: "For example, the Belarusian milk products since the beginning of August, the lowest 10% -15%."</seg>
<seg id="92">"Brazilian suppliers raised prices for pork almost doubled," complained Deputy General Director Sergei Cancer, "Стардогс."</seg>
<seg id="93">Chicken legs rose by 35%.</seg>
<seg id="94">Expect prices from China, can they остудят hot Brazilian head.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the near future in "Стардогсе" will increase the prices by 8%.</seg>
<seg id="96">Now, and so very undesirable to raise prices, "says Cancer.</seg>
<seg id="97">According to statistics, catering revenue growth for the second quarter of 2014, just 1.8%.</seg>
<seg id="98">This is the smallest rate since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="99">Retail prices will rise further, he admits, but it is not clear how quickly: While most work запаслось products over the next two months, hoping to wait out their purchase prices.</seg>
<seg id="100">But that will be in two months, no one knows.</seg>

<seg id="110">We are catching it and нерку горбушу чавычу, "royal salmon."</seg>
<seg id="111">Yes, they are not as fat as the Norwegian salmon, because it is wild fish.</seg>
<seg id="112">Norwegian salmon is the same aquaculture.</seg>

<seg id="11">But it can't be above a certain limit, the treaty has insurance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The idea, of course, useful and, in theory, is capable of relieving both Smith and roads.</seg>
<seg id="13">But, most likely, it will not delight in any car drivers, nor insurers.</seg>
<seg id="14">The last now talk about a serious threat to the growth of the fraud, which can result in the introduction of new rules on payments has.</seg>
<seg id="15">As for the drivers, it is difficult to imagine what kind of work will have to be done to overcome исконный Russian conservatism.</seg>
<seg id="16">In most cases, the driver would be hours to wait for the inspectors to arrange small accident, because it was new.</seg>
<seg id="17">And we still do not know what will be easier to convince drivers to win - or about the reliability of "европротокола."</seg>
<seg id="18">Savings certificate will be registered and irrevocable offer</seg>
<seg id="19">The Finance Ministry wants to block savings certificates to the bearer, but will allow banks to make them equivalent безотзывного contribution.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Finance Ministry is preparing a bill that would prohibit savings certificates to the bearer.</seg>
<seg id="21">In recent times, this tool is gaining popularity, as rates are higher than on bank deposits.</seg>
<seg id="22">The fact is that savings certificates to the bearer not the bank deposit insurance system, and cost less, since they do not have to make payments to the Fund Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA).</seg>
<seg id="23">Successfully situation that is expected to take this step because of the small and medium-sized banks, spreading such certificates, and suffer from Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which is estimated to have pointed out, the control 98 per cent of demand.</seg>
<seg id="24">And the share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, is about 3.5%.</seg>
<seg id="25">The problem, explains pointed out, is that a small bank customers, who bought such a certificate, in case of withdrawal of the license is trying to get money in the DIA.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates to the bearer, may assume that their investment is insured.</seg>
<seg id="27">The absence of reasonable insurance payments on these certificated in case of license revocation the bank can lead to misunderstandings and social tension.</seg>
<seg id="28">In practice, the agencies were cases when предъявительских certificate holders to seek insurance redress through the court, "said a DIA.</seg>
<seg id="29">The problem, of course, made-up.</seg>
<seg id="30">The certificates pay buyers still nobody will, because under the law they have no right to compensation from the State.</seg>
<seg id="31">If the case was not an instrument that is insured in the DIA, together with him and would have banned metal accounts, which means citizens are taken into consideration in grams of one of four metal - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.</seg>
<seg id="32">Since these accounts do not fall into a system of deposit insurance, but their existence as long as no one deprives.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is likely that the bearer certificates are a very convenient comprising, in fact, can act as квазиденег.</seg>
<seg id="34">With almost no control of their movement: Any customer of the bank can buy a certificate to any citizen, and bacteria can change a certificate to a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is not by chance that the draft that savings certificate must be issued in paper value, which must be stored in depositories.</seg>
<seg id="36">But Putin, added that banks are allowed to issue such certificates without the right to early repayment.</seg>
<seg id="37">That is a similar безотзывного contribution, which has long been a dream of the bankers.</seg>

<seg id="1">Met two Union</seg>
<seg id="2">The talks in Minsk is not solved the problems for which were called back, but gave rise to a new format: The European Union met with the chief executives of the future European</seg>
<seg id="3">If lifestyle changes have fuelled an alarming about the situation around Ukraine (отлагательств does not tolerate), the leaders of the EU and Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of "hot issues."</seg>
<seg id="4">It is capable of such a structure to work effectively, it is not clear; but it is clear who took the cream from that summit.</seg>
<seg id="5">Questions on this score fell away in the evening on August 26, when the Belarusians, and after them and other евразийцы with Europeans saw to 45 new President Lukashenko.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Belarusian leader showed an example of polished talent, this was the behaviour of a man who had just caught the jackpot - and is planning a decent old age in high society.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Maidan Lukashenko helped</seg>
<seg id="8">The arrival of the three main European commissioners (of the EU), who met with Mr. Lukashenko and allowed him to perform on the final briefing on their behalf -- not just for the past легитимация president.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is the subject of an application for recognition of a full European policy and the main медиатором Ukrainian crisis.</seg>
<seg id="10">A senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Studies Denis Мельянцов sure: From now on, Brussels will not have to deal with Minsk in the same tone as before.</seg>
<seg id="11">"What Catherine Ashton met face to face with Lukashenko, gives reason to believe that the relationship with the EU will be размораживаться and beyond," he said "Огоньку."</seg>
<seg id="12">This is the hidden part of the iceberg: The breakthrough the Belarusian authorities began long before November Maidan in Kiev - in summer 2013-го.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The results have been achieved and the EU is the successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues about modernization," lists interlocutor of Ogonyok which had - and with the United States held talks on international security.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even the United States took a little bit of sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="15">As for the Ukrainian events, they and the response to them, only Belarus invoked another influx of this process.</seg>
<seg id="16">Minsk, on the one hand, managed to keep relations with Ukraine are warm enough, not much to lose in mutual trade, and a President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for talks.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other, the Belarusian leader, who admitted not de jure joining of Crimea to Russia and called for punishing pro-Russian militia in the Donbass region with all severity, and quarreled with Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="18">Minsk came from neither the Customs Union nor of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, and to be a Russian air base.</seg>
<seg id="19">Brussels and Washington have noticed a balanced position on the issue - a Ukrainian and Belarusian experts assessed her, sure.</seg>
<seg id="20">How successful will the movement's political diversification, will be seen by how often the Minsk should ever take meetings in the format of the EU + TC.</seg>
<seg id="21">The press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy Catherine Ashton and diplomacy have failed to answer questions about what Brussels wants from the relationship in a new format.</seg>
<seg id="22">A spokesman for Ashton said only "Mayan Косьянчич Огоньку" that, against the background of the issues of war and peace the issue is not a priority.</seg>
<seg id="23">While there were reports that following a meeting on the Ukraine issue, with the participation of the people in the new format may be, and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="24">Drop tar to Belarus was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that, for him, it turns out, personally asked the representatives of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, the final briefing Alexander Lukashenko made it clear: All sides not against that Minsk has remained the central platform for meeting both Россия--ОБСЕ--Украина format, and at the level of heads of states and representatives of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="26">This means that "the last dictator in Europe" becomes a quite рукопожатного European leader who helps to solve a global problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">The farmer's best friend</seg>
<seg id="28">The EU delegation, which included еврокомиссаров on trade and energy, pushed to the conclusion: The main underlying reason for the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbas, and economy.</seg>
<seg id="29">In fact, the meeting schedule сверстанное future negotiations for gas supply and to overcome fear of the CU in the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the EU appears to be more extensive than peace declaration without specific dates and numbers.</seg>
<seg id="30">Trade Commissioner Karl De Гюхт, however, identified the: EU officials "arrived in Minsk to seek a political solution to the crisis, which has economic consequences, and not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="31">It seems, however, that the economy and the crisis in Ukraine "is working" in Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its consequences - and above all reciprocal sanctions from the West and Russia - give Minsk, who himself is under pressure, санкционное until the room for maneuver.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to the leader of the Mises Research Centre, the presidential Belarus Yaroslav Ramanchuk, European investors are actively interested in opportunities for supplies of agricultural products to Russia in bypassing sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="34">The supplies are schemes by which Vladimir Putin at the summit пожурил Minsk.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Billions of these schemes," said Romanchuk Огоньку "," are not the Belarusian businessmen and Russian companies.</seg>
<seg id="36">They worked for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today the scheme destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Russian business badly needs to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of the Belarusian authorities.</seg>
<seg id="38">The second story, "the expert continues," is associated with the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not away to Belarus from Ukraine in the production of raw materials as well as focusing on the Russian market.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Ukrainian producers about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and the Belarusian производственно-торговые scheme now could be very popular. "</seg>
<seg id="40">According to Ramanchuk, the role of the host site for the negotiations, the EU and the CU is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of the development of economic ties with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="41">He recalls that the loss of the agricultural sector of the EU sanctions against Moscow are estimated at 10 billion euros, and the Commission is currently proposed аграриям only 125 million euros in compensation.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Belarusian president could offer to Brussels to work together to minimise the consequences for еврофермеров.</seg>
<seg id="43">This can raise the authority of Lukashenko to the EU to unprecedented heights.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hospitality without initiatives</seg>
<seg id="45">Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative for the summit.</seg>
<seg id="46">But the paradox is that the Minsk from his active role in the birth of the format, and the TC + открещивается Belarusian leader at a meeting with Ukrainian counterpart emphasized that the initiator of a new format and it was.</seg>
<seg id="47">"It was your suggestion to come, without any навала discuss, not with бухты-барахты decide, after the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU, to sort out the situation, which at the time was in the Ukraine," he said, before the cameras to Peter Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, observers interpreted it as an attempt to reassure Moscow, it is rumoured, was initially against the mediation, which greatly increases its political weight.</seg>
<seg id="49">In the Belarusian diplomatic establishment carefully emphasize that cooperation between the EU and Belarus in the organization on its soil does not pursue a lucrative goals, and the ultimate goal of this format in the future - the creation of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.</seg>
<seg id="50">"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts which, in other areas, in particular in the field of security, puts and promotes the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation," the Foreign Ministry said "Огоньку" in Belarus, where the words were chosen very carefully.</seg>

<seg id="4">However, Mr Putin's call for the Government to start negotiations with non-uniform government-controlled insurgents as with equal with obvious strategy, which it should be from the start of the bloodshed five months ago: To help take back the separatists and the Ukrainian government to force новопровозглашенной Новороссии of de facto independence, to move closer to Russia, and not with the West.</seg>

<seg id="3">About their discovery, they reported in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly about them can be found in a press release at the University of California in Santa Barbara.</seg>
<seg id="4">Гневное expression - joined by climbing in and down eyebrows, lips, the thin line of 2030 nostrils - equally in all cultures, and make it even blind from birth, children who had seen it, said study lead author Aaron Селл.</seg>
<seg id="5">As part of a major research project on the nature of the anger, the scientists found that arose this emotion for the effective conduct of disputes during the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="6">The more physical damage one man can do to another, the greater the opportunity to dictate the message, and he is to partner with anger.</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers have confirmed their hypothesis: Physically and other powerful people more likely to get angry and pitch invasions, consider themselves entitled to impose other disadvantageous conditions for them, as well as the power to resolve conflicts by peaceful methods.</seg>
<seg id="8">Starting from that anger is a bargaining emotion, "first of all, the scientists decided that the movement of each of the seven groups of muscles that create сердитое expression must represent гневающегося individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor, and thereby get as quickly as possible to agree to its terms in order to avoid conflict.</seg>
<seg id="9">To test this hypothesis, the researchers modelled on a computer, where each of the seven had or was absent гневного elements, and showed them информантам.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although by climbing in eyebrow or chin individually by forward did not do the face of evil, the Club features a man with such a strong physically, the study participants acknowledged unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="11">Anger as human, and with animals, expresses a threat: An exaggerated manifestation of his own forces, the reaffirmation to agree and to obey.</seg>
<seg id="12">Man поджимает inflated nostrils and lips with the same purpose, and a frog that надувается or бабуин, which demonstrates their fangs.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Anger" runs "refusal to accept the situation, and the face immediately takes shape, effectively has demonstrated the opposite side of the consequences of this failure.</seg>
<seg id="14">But the most striking is that none of the components гневного faces is not arbitrary, they are one and the same, "said anthropologist John Туби.</seg>
