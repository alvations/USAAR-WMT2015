<seg id="1">Reconnecting With the Very American Ideal That Labor Rights Are Human Rights</seg>
<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed legislation to the organization of and to join trade unions as a civil etablieren to.</seg>
<seg id="3">"As go unions, such as, the Minnesota Democrat who serves so go middle-class jobs," says Ellison, a Congressional Progressive Caucus co-chair.</seg>
<seg id="4">That's why I'm proud to introduce Empowerment Act with civil rights icon John Lewis the Employee Empowerment Act.</seg>
<seg id="5">This ground-breaking legislation will give workers the same legal options for union organizing discrimination as for other forms of discrimination - stopping anti-union forces in their tracks</seg>
<seg id="6">Amending the National Labor Relations Act to a discrimination ausgesetzte organization to give workers Gewerkschaftsvertretung a union organizing to sue for justice in the civil courts - and to collect compensatory and punitive damages - is a sound and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">But it in certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">Indeed, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the cosponsors of their Gesetzesvorlage vorschlagen a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the battering that unions have taken in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and states across the country - Americans once encouraged countries around the world to embrace, extend and respect labor rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time, within the living memory of millions of Americans, when this country championed democracy, freedom of speech Pressefreiheit, and the right to organize in the same breath.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his aides encouraged the country to adopt a constitution designed to assure that Hideki Tojo's militarized autocracy would be replaced with democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fully aware that workers and their unions had in shaping the new Japan had a role to play, they included language that explicitly recognized that "the right of workers to organize and to bargain and act collectively is guaranteed."</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides urged the Germans to write a constitution that would assure that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced with muscular democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">That workers would need to organize Recognizing and make their voices heard in the new nation, the Germans included a provision that explicitly declared: "The right to form associations to safeguard improve working and economic conditions shall be guaranteed and to every individual and to every occupation or profession.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that this in answer to a presentation given by the einschr√§nken or seek to impair null and void; measures directed to this end shall be unlawful.</seg>
<seg id="16">When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that would in 1948 be adopted by the United Nations as a global covenant, Roosevelt and the drafters included a guarantee that "everyone has the right, there is no obligation to join trade unions for the protection of his interests to form and to join trade".</seg>
<seg id="17">For generations, Americans accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country counseled other countries on how to forge civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize a trade union - and to have that trade union engage in collective bargaining as an equal partner with corporations and government agencies - had to be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">After those rights under in America Beschuss gerieten does it is very weise that he should get in touch with the American Ideal again, when it comes to questions about technology, to demzufolge, the American ideal that working people must have a right to organize and make their voices heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:</seg>
<seg id="21">History is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now everyone knows that the labor movement did not diminish the strength of the nation but enlarged it.</seg>
<seg id="23">But with the Anhebung Lebensstandards of the people of millions, labor miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to undreamed of levels of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack labor forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.</seg>
<seg id="25">History remembers, as should we.</seg>
<seg id="26">The formal recognition of labor rights as human rights - and the extension of civil rights protections to prevent discrimination against labor organizing - is long overdue.</seg>
<seg id="27">Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing ideals that have historically enlarged America and made real the promise of democracy.</seg>

<seg id="7">Abortion rights activists applauded the decision, the latest in a string of rulings against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to seek hospital privileges.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today's ruling ensures Louisiana women are safe from an underhanded law that seeks to strip them of their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, president and chief executive of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which sued names of three of the state's five clinics to block the law aufzuhalten.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the ruling applied to doctors from the two clinics who were not plaintiffs in the suit and have also applied for admitting privileges.</seg>

<seg id="12">Abortion rights campaigners, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say admitting privileges laws impose medically unnecessary requirements on doctors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Anti-abortion advocates have countered that the measures aim to protect women's health, though some have also lauded their effect of shuttering clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has hospital admitting privileges, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all other doctors in the state are forced to stop performing abortions, would, are already staying at home for fear that doctor, fearful for his safety the procedure, the group said.</seg>
<seg id="16">In arguing against the ruling, Louisiana officials said they will not punish doctors performing abortions said they would not, while their applications for admitting privileges were pending.</seg>

<seg id="10">Until a cease-fire halted the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad remained indoors or left their homes for safer areas further away from Gaza to escape rocket and mortar fire.</seg>
<seg id="11">Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community close to the Gaza frontier where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are hesitant about coming back.</seg>

<seg id="21">Israel disputes the figures and estimates that at least half of those killed were militants, has not provided firm evidence to back its claims.</seg>
<seg id="22">On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians, including a Thai worker, were killed.</seg>
<seg id="23">Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mortars at Israeli cities during the fighting, mostly in the south.</seg>
<seg id="24">The Israeli military, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.</seg>
<seg id="2">Never said "I love you"</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was one of seven children born to Jamaican immigrants in Dudley in the Midlands in 1958.</seg>
<seg id="4">His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry is rehearsing a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and has grown out of the Radio 4 series.</seg>
<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap and the tunes are upbeat.</seg>
<seg id="7">But Henry has had to work through some difficult memories of childhood.</seg>
<seg id="8">There was "a lot" of therapy after his mother died and Henry is reflective about his relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was very unknowable.</seg>
<seg id="10">You never saw his face, you just heard his voice: 'Stop the noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Leave your sister alone.</seg>
<seg id="12">Move!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch the cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were grown-up when I was a kid - went with him in the pub and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass the beauty of the stroke cricket.</seg>
<seg id="15">I never had a conversation with him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He for a lot of my life was this unsmiling bloke in the corner, reading the paper for a.</seg>
<seg id="17">Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in his father's day, he got a snapshot of what life like for him must have been.</seg>
<seg id="18">It's a bit brighter now but they're dark, smoky, Stygian labyrinthine depths with bursts of flame and smoke and lots of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My dad used to get in the just Wanne and you'd hear him slowly start to sing to himself because he would wash the foundry off him,.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I walked round it, I realised that he had done that for years and years to put food on the table, and my estimation of him went up.</seg>
<seg id="21">None the less, Henry emerged from a childhood stripped of parental affection.</seg>
<seg id="22">My dad never did hugging, never said, 'I love you'.</seg>
<seg id="23">It wasn't until my mum was poorly near the end of her life that we started saying 'I love you, I love you, I love you.</seg>
<seg id="24">Having a daughter of his own, Billie, with Dawn French, enabled him to share the love he missed as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">Could you stop with the "I love you"?</seg>
<seg id="26">Just stop hugging me!</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I'm 22!</seg>
<seg id="28">With Dawn French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why wouldn't I be friends with Dawn?</seg>
<seg id="30">She's a great mum.</seg>
<seg id="31">He's still very good friends with French, to whom he was married for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="32">Dawn's a good person.</seg>
<seg id="33">Why wouldn't I be friends with Dawn?</seg>
<seg id="34">She's a great mum.</seg>
<seg id="35">Henry's own mother was diabetic.</seg>
<seg id="36">It was one of the things that killed.</seg>
<seg id="37">So when I became very, very overweight and started getting diabetic symptoms, my doctor said, 'You've got to be radical.</seg>
<seg id="38">So I went on a big fitness thing, and I also had to go on a drastic diet to the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It's very hard.</seg>
<seg id="40">And it's tedious.</seg>
<seg id="41">Nobody likes eating carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">Henry's change in career trajectory is, perhaps, reflected in his distinguished, close-cropped beard.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he won critical acclaim for his Othello, he has become engrossed in the theatre.</seg>
<seg id="44">Comedy of Errors followed, as did Fences by August Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="45">It's a different experience from the sitcoms and comedies that have upholstered his busy working life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He started out when he was just 16 and working at a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">A DJ spotted him on stage doing impressions and wrote to New Faces about him.</seg>
<seg id="48">His TV career was launched in the mid-Seventies: "For quite a long time I was the only black impressionist / comedian on telly."</seg>
<seg id="49">He learnt on the job.</seg>
<seg id="50">I had not only up in the public eye, but also have to grow to learn how to I would have to be an efficient joke-delivering mechanism between 1975, a star, being on television and it was really difficult.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny on New Faces in 1975</seg>
<seg id="52">Because his manager owned the stage rights to The Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment programme in which people "blacked up," Henry found himself performing his comedy in it for five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">My family were very uncomfortable about it.</seg>
<seg id="54">I sort of wish it had never happened, but I don't regret that I did it.</seg>
<seg id="55">It was a weird, reprehensible position to be in, I was working in huge venues and learning how to work a crowd.</seg>
<seg id="56">But what was an "award-winning light entertainment staple of British television for years and years" was also a "grotesque parody of black people."</seg>
<seg id="57">Introducing characters who the, who both lampooned and celebrated black British culture, Henry worked alternative comedy circuit in the Eighties.</seg>
<seg id="58">The first series of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the Nineties he was known as, among other things, chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.</seg>
<seg id="59">Advertisements, documentaries, TV series and parts in films consumed his next decade but after his BBC-Serie a LennyHenry.tv, he thought: "What are you going to do next, Len, because it all feels a bit like you're marking time or you're slightly going sideways."</seg>
<seg id="60">What came next was a Radio 4 documentary series called What's So Great About...?</seg>
<seg id="61">The first was on Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="62">I had a real allergy to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">I wasn't really taught it at school never middle-class gelernt and thought it was very much the reserve of white people with tights and a Kohlkopf vorne we could.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I was very frightened of it.</seg>
<seg id="65">Everybody we interviewed on that show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, 'You should try it.</seg>
<seg id="66">Don't slag it off if you don't know what you're talking about.</seg>
<seg id="67">Get some of the words in your mouth and then you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry delivered 20 lines of Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was hooked.</seg>
<seg id="69">It gave me the feeling that I could do it.</seg>
<seg id="70">It's almost like I had my head put on straight for me.</seg>
<seg id="71">'This is what it's about, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your lines, do some research.</seg>
<seg id="72">So the rehearsal process was brutal and I las monatelang piece this, before we did it.</seg>
<seg id="73">And it was a success.</seg>
<seg id="74">They seemed to expect a car crash and it didn't quite happen.</seg>
<seg id="75">Soon he was starring in Comedy of Errors.</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I'm at the National Theatre and I just couldn't quite believe it.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was one moment where I thought, 'Oh, you've changed. ""</seg>
<seg id="78">There was a technical fault and Henry instinctively felt that it was his job to keep the audience entertained.</seg>
<seg id="79">"A little voice inside me said, 'You're going to have to do 10 minutes while they fix the computer." "</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead the performance verk√ºndete that would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I walked off the stage and something in me went, "Oh, thank God".</seg>
<seg id="82">It's not my responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can let somebody else sort it out.</seg>
<seg id="84">'You're in a play, stay in character. ""</seg>
<seg id="85">Henry appearing in Fences at the Duchess Theatre</seg>
<seg id="86">Learning his lines for Fences was challenging.</seg>
<seg id="87">Panic's quite good, it stiffens the sinews.</seg>
<seg id="88">That was well received too, so it's like a big sign from the gods, saying, 'This is what you should be doing. ""</seg>
<seg id="89">He says this, of course, in a BOOMING voice.</seg>
<seg id="90">So I'm sticking with it.</seg>
<seg id="91">I'm really loving it.</seg>
<seg id="92">I love being in a rehearsal room.</seg>
<seg id="93">Henry still has a comedian's brain, though - the mechanics of how we conversation is broken with flashes of his humour as he slips in and out of impressions.</seg>
<seg id="94">I'm just choosing not to do stand-up because that thing of getting instant gratification from a room full of Fremder is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="95">If you're constantly seeking that it can lead to a brick wall.</seg>
<seg id="96">I do Live at the Apollo sometimes when I want to, but generally it doesn't float my boat like it used to.</seg>
<seg id="97">I ask whether he'll ever do another stand-up tour.</seg>
<seg id="98">The joy of sitting in a room with a director who, who is helping to shape a beginning, middle and end of a journey - I don't think I'll ever want to give that up.</seg>
<seg id="99">So this is his new incarnation?</seg>
<seg id="100">I think so.</seg>
<seg id="101">I like being an actor.</seg>
<seg id="102">It's good fun.</seg>
<seg id="103">You're always telling a story and that's a great place to be.</seg>
<seg id="104">I love stories.</seg>
<seg id="105">People love stories.</seg>

<seg id="3">During his teaching time, Manfred Richter got to know many gestandene Petershausener and Kollbach.</seg>
<seg id="4">His methods were sometimes unconventional, but they were always based on his desire to see the adult in the child.</seg>
<seg id="5">Mount Snƒõ≈æka is one of the best-known peaks in the Czech Giant Mountains.</seg>
<seg id="6">Manfred Richter loves this painting of a picture from his childhood home.</seg>
<seg id="7">Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau / Nordb√∂hmen, today's Trutnov.</seg>
<seg id="8">He was interested in the age of 14, after he had been a secondary school pupil for four years ago, as well as the in becoming a teacher as early as.</seg>
<seg id="9">One year later the Germans living in the Sudetenland were dispossessed.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.</seg>
<seg id="11">After a few months spent in a holding camp, they moved to Bavaria in 1946 - in a goods train.</seg>
<seg id="12">That was how he came to live in Senkendorf, in Upper Franconia.</seg>
<seg id="13">The teacher training course was in Bamberg.</seg>
<seg id="14">In order to get to the school, Manfred Richter had to go six times per week on foot to the Bahn to Bamberg; from there walk three kilometres right across the town to the school; and then make the return journey home.</seg>
<seg id="15">After two months. Manfred Richter was given the Red Cross Home in Bamberg, a bed that he shared with 15 to sleep at the Schlafsaal in a.</seg>
<seg id="16">In 1951, he took his first state exam, and 1954, after spending three further years as a teaching candidate second.</seg>
<seg id="17">With Oberfranken for him freie don't Lehrerstelle, he applied to Upper Bavaria and received a post on 1 November 1954 at a school in Kollbach.</seg>
<seg id="18">The "Young Women's Room" was his first "Service Flat" in the school building.</seg>
<seg id="19">In 1958, he moved into the new-build teacher accommodation next door to the school, into a three-room service flat.</seg>
<seg id="20">Manfred Richter bought this house in 1980, after the school in Kollbach was closed in 1968.</seg>
<seg id="21">Until then, there are in Kollbach the school district association of Petershausen-Kollbach had three Klassen and five in Petershausen.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the school year of 1968 / 69, these classes were accommodated in Petershausen, in today's town hall.</seg>
<seg id="23">When the Indersdorf Schools Association was founded, the only school left in the locality was the primary school.</seg>
<seg id="24">Order to avoid a deranking of position in the now smaller school, the then dean, Georg Sigl decided to move to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.</seg>
<seg id="25">However, Petershausen continued to grow, and so the children and their teachers, from September 1982 onwards, could move into the present-day building, which has since been extended, after Richter took his retirement.</seg>
<seg id="26">Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated manner and spirit of generosity of the then Mayor, Ludwig G√∂tz, who was able to secure municipal funds to build an additional work-room and extra rooms in the cellar as part of the 1997 extensions - although the council guidelines governing school-building work did not allow subsidies to be used to.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Mayor G√∂tz was a great friend of the school," recalls Richter, with gratitude.</seg>
<seg id="28">Throughout his whole career, Manfred Richter never forgot a reply given the, in a speech by a government representative to a presentation given by law and justice: "One should never forget to love". Manfred Richter duly implemented what he had heard as a young teacher.</seg>
<seg id="29">"One has to give children two things: Roots and wings," says the 84 year-old.</seg>
<seg id="30">But experience has also taught him that: "One doesn't always achieve that." Whether by that he means his pupils or his own six children, is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="31">In any case Richter was Tun sometimes unconventional.</seg>
<seg id="32">If school children got into fights, they were not given punishments like, for example, for example, writing out lines or serving a Strafarbeit, and also were not the Nachsitzen verdonnert.</seg>
<seg id="33">At the cost of the council, Richter bought two pairs of boxing gloves, and then let the two antagonists fight it out, even if this did occasionally produce a black-eye.</seg>
<seg id="34">For the benefit of the school, Richter nurtured a good relationship with the then Mayor, Ludwig G√∂tz (CSU).</seg>
<seg id="35">Following his retirement, Richter, who had no political allegiances, was encouraged by the Mayor to run for election onto the local council as a candidate for the CSU in 1996.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, Richter finished in sixth and joined the CSU.</seg>

<seg id="15">Kevern had been sitting holding hands with Ailinn on broken deckchairs in the long grass, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, the pair of them absent-mindedly plugged into the utility console that supplied the country with soothing music and calming news, when the sight of her crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song by a long-forgotten black entertainer his father liked listening to with the cottage blinds.</seg>
<seg id="16">Your feet's too big.</seg>
<seg id="17">On account of their innate aggressiveness, songs of that sort were no longer played on the console.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not banned - nothing was banned exactly - simply not played.</seg>
<seg id="19">Encouraged to fall into desuetude, like the word desuetude.</seg>
<seg id="20">Popular taste did what edict and proscription could never have done, and just as, when it came to the people chose rags-to-riches memoirs, cookbooks and romances, so, when it came to music, they chose ballads.</seg>
<seg id="21">Carried away by the day, Kevern began to play at an imaginary piano and in a rudely comic voice serenade Ailinn's big feet.</seg>
<seg id="22">Ailinn didn't understand.</seg>
<seg id="23">"It was a popular song by a jazz pianist called Fats Waller," he told her, automatically putting two fingers to his lips.</seg>
<seg id="24">This his father had always done to stifle the letter j before it left his lips.</seg>
<seg id="25">It had begun as a game between them when he was small.</seg>
<seg id="26">His father had played it with his own father, he'd told him.</seg>
<seg id="27">Begin a word with a j without remembering to put two fingers across your mouth and it cost you a penny.</seg>
<seg id="28">It had not been much fun then and it was not much fun now.</seg>
<seg id="29">He knew it was expected of him, that was all.</seg>
<seg id="30">He had to explain what jazz was.</seg>
<seg id="31">Ailinn had never heard any.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jazz, too, without exactly being proscribed, wasn't played.</seg>
<seg id="33">Improvisation had fallen out of fashion.</seg>
<seg id="34">There was room for only one "if" in life.</seg>
<seg id="35">People wanted to be sure, when a tune began, exactly where it was going to end.</seg>
<seg id="36">Wit, the same.</seg>
<seg id="37">Its unpredictability unsettled people's nerves.</seg>
<seg id="38">And jazz was wit expressed musically.</seg>
<seg id="39">Though he reached age of 10 without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, one of, when it comes to have a bit Kevern knew of jazz from his father of his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.</seg>
<seg id="40">But at least he didn't have to tell Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">Given her age, she was unlikely to have remembered a time, when popular singers weren't black.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again, no laws or duress.</seg>
<seg id="43">A compliant society meant that every section of it consented with gratitude - the gratitude of the providentially spared - to the principle of group aptitude.</seg>
<seg id="44">People of Afro-Caribbean origin were suited by temperament and physique to entertainment and athletics, and so they sang and sprinted.</seg>
<seg id="45">People originally from the Indian subcontinent, electronically gifted as though by nature, undertook to ensure no family was without a functioning utility phone.</seg>
<seg id="46">What was left of was left of the Polish community plumbed; what of the Greek smashed plates.</seg>
<seg id="47">Those from the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents hadn't quickly left the country while WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED was happening, when it comes to be accused of having stoked fearing, indeed, that the Flammen they would consume them next - opened labneh and shisha-pipe restaurants, kept their heads down, and grew depressed with idleness.</seg>
<seg id="48">To each according to his gifts.</seg>
<seg id="49">Having heard only ballads, Ailinn was hard to understand how the insulting words Kevern, who had just sung to her ever have been, could be.</seg>
<seg id="50">Music was the expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">"They're not really insulting," Kevern said.</seg>
<seg id="52">Except maybe to people whose feet are too big.</seg>
<seg id="53">My father never insulted anybody, but he delighted in this song.</seg>
<seg id="54">He was saying too much, but the garden's neglect gave the illusion of safety.</seg>
<seg id="55">No word could get beyond the soundproofing of the giant cabbage-like leaves.</seg>
<seg id="56">Ailinn still didn't comprehend.</seg>
<seg id="57">Why would your father have loved something like that?</seg>
<seg id="58">He wanted to say it was a joke, but was reluctant, in her company to put two fingers to his lips again.</seg>
<seg id="59">She already thought he was strange.</seg>
<seg id="60">"It struck him as funny," he said instead.</seg>
<seg id="61">She shook her head in disbelief, blotting out Kevern's vision.</seg>
<seg id="62">In the whole wide world but Nothing to see, but her haystack of crow-black hair.</seg>
<seg id="63">Nothing else he wanted to see.</seg>
<seg id="64">"If you say so," she said, unconvinced.</seg>
<seg id="65">But that still doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.</seg>
<seg id="66">She seemed in genuine distress.</seg>
<seg id="67">Are my feet too big?</seg>
<seg id="68">He looked again.</seg>
<seg id="69">Your feet specifically, no.</seg>
<seg id="70">Your ankles, maybe, a bit...</seg>
<seg id="71">And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?</seg>
<seg id="72">Hate you?</seg>
<seg id="73">Of course I don't hate you.</seg>
<seg id="74">That's just the silly song.</seg>
<seg id="75">He could have said, "I love you," but it was too soon for that.</seg>
<seg id="76">"Your thick ankles are the very reason I'm attracted to you," he tried instead.</seg>
<seg id="77">I'm perverse that way.</seg>
<seg id="78">It came out wrong.</seg>
<seg id="79">He had meant it to be funny.</seg>
<seg id="80">Meaning to him, often, in a mess because he, like his father, as well as the reassuring charm necessary to be funny landed, the cruelty that lurked in jokes.</seg>
<seg id="81">Maybe his father intended to be cruel.</seg>
<seg id="82">Maybe he, Kevern, did.</seg>
<seg id="83">Despite his kind eyes.</seg>
<seg id="84">Ailinn Solomons flushed and rose from her deckchair, knocking over the console and spilling the wine they'd been drinking.</seg>
<seg id="85">Elderflower wine, so drink wasn't his excuse.</seg>
<seg id="86">In her agitation she seemed to tremble, like the Palmwedel in the Sturm.</seg>
<seg id="87">"And your thick head's the very reason I'm perversely attracted to you," she said...</seg>
<seg id="88">Except that I'm not.</seg>
<seg id="89">He felt sorry for her, both on account of the unnecessary unkindness of his words and the fear that showed in her eyes in the moment of her standing up to him.</seg>
<seg id="90">Did she think he'd strike her?</seg>
<seg id="91">She hadn't spoken to him about life on the chill northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he didn't doubt it was in all essentials similar to here.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same vast and eiskalte Ozean brach to find intelligent solutions, as has in recent pelvis injury, such as the Ufer.</seg>
<seg id="93">The same befuddled men, even more thin-skinned and peevish in aftermath of WHAT HAPPENED than their smuggler and wrecker ancestors had been, roamed angrily from pub to pub, ready to raise a hand to any woman, who dared to refuse or twit them.</seg>
<seg id="94">Thick head?</seg>
<seg id="95">They'd show her a thick fist, if she wasn't careful!</seg>
<seg id="96">Snog her first - the snog having become the most common expression of erotic irritation between men and women; an antidote to the bland ballads of love the console pumped out - snog her first and cuff her later.</seg>
<seg id="97">In Kevern's view it was a unnecessary Verfeinerung, snog itself an act of thuggery.</seg>
<seg id="98">Ailinn Solomons made a sign with her body for him to leave.</seg>
<seg id="99">He heaved himself out of the deckchair like an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She felt leaden herself, but the weight of his grief surprised her.</seg>
<seg id="101">This wasn't the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They barely knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">She watched him go - as at an upstairs window her companion watched him go - a man made heavy by what he'd brought on himself.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam leaving the garden, she thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">She felt a pang for him and for men in general, no matter that some had raised their hands to her.</seg>
<seg id="106">A man turned from her, his back bent, ashamed, defeated, all the fight in him leaked away - why was that a sight she to well, when she refused to a't recall a single instance, she knew so today, of seen it?</seg>
<seg id="107">Alone again, Ailinn Solomons looked at her feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">A score or so years before the events related above Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher employed by Ofnow, the non-statutory monitor of the Public Mood, a short paper on the continuance of low- and medium-level violence of the country where its reduction, if not its cessation, on uprooting it expected, given the money and energy, which is based in the expended prepared.</seg>
<seg id="109">"It has been done, and much continues to be done," she wrote, "to soothe the native aggressiveness of a people who Much has been have fought a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in those twisted knarls and narrow crevices of the country, the though where spires of churches soar above the hedgerows, the sweeter breath, historically, been rarely felt.</seg>
<seg id="110">But some qualities are proving to be ineradicable.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher the spire, it would seem, the lower the passions it goes on engendering.</seg>
<seg id="112">The populace weeps to sentimental ballads, gorges on stories a, ardently in the virtues of marriage and Familienleben believe to, but not only does the pertinacious hold equally on rural communities as on our st√§dtischen Gef√ºge for in the, evidence suggests the emergence of a new and vicious quarrelsomeness in the home, in the workplace, on our roads and even on our playing fields.</seg>
<seg id="113">"You have an unfortunate tendency to overwrite," her supervisor said when he had read the whole report.</seg>
<seg id="114">May I suggest you read fewer novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also enquire: Are you an atheist?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I believe I am not obliged to say," Esme Nussbaum replied.</seg>
<seg id="118">Are you a lesbian?</seg>
<seg id="119">Again Esme protested her right to privacy and silence.</seg>
<seg id="120">A feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Silence once more.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I don't ask," Luther Rabinowitz said at last, "because I have an objection to atheism, lesbianism or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">This is a prejudice-free workplace.</seg>
<seg id="124">We are the servants of a prejudice-free society.</seg>
<seg id="125">But certain kinds of hypersensitivity, while entirely acceptable and laudable in themselves can, may sometimes distort findings such as you have presented to me.</seg>
<seg id="126">You are obviously yourself prejudiced against the church; and those things you call "vicious" and "brutish," others could as soon interpret as expressions of natural vigour and vitality.</seg>
<seg id="127">To still be harping on about WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED, as though it happened, if it happened, yesterday, is to sap the country of its essential life force.</seg>
<seg id="128">Esme Nussbaum looked around her while Rabinowitz spoke.</seg>
<seg id="129">Behind his head a flamingo pink LED scroll repeated the advice Ofnow, the country for the last quarter of a century or more had been.</seg>
<seg id="130">Smile at your neighbour, cherish your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your telephone, converse, explain, listen, agree, apologise.</seg>
<seg id="131">Talk is better than silence, the sung word is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I fully understand the points you are making," Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice, once she was certain her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I am saying no more than that we are not healed as effectively as we delude ourselves we are.</seg>
<seg id="133">My concern is that, if we are Vorwarnung without wom√∂glich us wiederfinden it was also a means to explain why we will find ourselves repeating the mistakes that, which led to WHAT HAPPENED, IF IT HAPPENED place.</seg>
<seg id="134">Only this time it will not be on others that we vent our anger and mistrust.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Rabinowitz made a pyramid of his fingers.</seg>
<seg id="136">This was to suggest infinite patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"You go too far," he said, "in describing as" mistakes "actions which our grandparents might or might not have taken.</seg>
<seg id="138">You go too far, as well as well, in speaking of the their "anger" and "mistrust" on "others have ausgelassen".</seg>
<seg id="139">It should not be necessary to remind someone in your position to we that in understanding the past, as in protecting the present, do not speak of "us" and "them."</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "we" and there were no "others."</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of disorder, that is all we know of it.</seg>
<seg id="142">"In which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to interject, "no section of society can claim to have acquitted itself well.</seg>
<seg id="143">I make no accusations.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it was done ill, or done well, what was done was done,.</seg>
<seg id="145">Then was then.</seg>
<seg id="146">No more needs to be said - on this we agree.</seg>
<seg id="147">And just as there is no blame to be apportioned, so there are no amends to be made, were amends appropriate and were there any way of making them.</seg>

<seg id="2">The rise in the Manufacturing growth in the eurozone slowed to in August, as well as the, according to a closely-watched survey.</seg>
<seg id="3">The final Markit's Eurozone Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) dipped to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">A figure above 50 indicates expansion.</seg>
<seg id="5">New orders dwindled and factories suffered amid rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">The figures come ahead of the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">The will be a clear plan from Markets looking for the bank to deal with a stalled eurozone recovery, as well as the threat of deflation with inflation standing at just 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation that ECB boss Mario Draghi could offer further indications later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone, similar to those taken by the UK and US during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Although some growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effect of rising economic and geopolitical Unsicherheiten for the Hersteller deutlicher geworden," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.</seg>
<seg id="10">The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's biggest trade partner in the EU, fell to an 11-month low of 51.4.</seg>
<seg id="11">Meanwhile, in the bloc's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.</seg>
<seg id="12">France remains a real concern, as does Italy's descent from solid expansion to stagnation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Signs that growth impetus waned in the key industrial engine of Germany, and in Spain and the Netherlands too, is also less than reassuring, "Mr Dobson said.</seg>
<seg id="14">The slowdown in industry is the likely to add further fuel to the fire expecting additional monetary or fiscal stimulus to be implemented.</seg>

<seg id="2">Ten years ago over 1,000 people were hostage by Chechen militants at a school in in Beslan, southern Russia</seg>
<seg id="3">More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day ordeal that shocked the world.</seg>
<seg id="4">We went back to Beslan Russia to find some of the victims who cheated death in the classroom atrocity.</seg>
<seg id="5">Exactly a decade after the appalling Beslan school siege in which 334 perished, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="6">When fanatic Islamic terrorists kidnapped and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the start of a new term, it seemed like the nadir of all evil.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tragedy united east and west in revulsion, which amazingly then turned to action and hope for the future in the direst misery.</seg>
<seg id="8">Ten years on we went back to Beslan in southern, Russia to find some of the victims who cheated death in the classroom atrocity.</seg>
<seg id="9">We discovered amazing young people, who have defied adversity, though the memory of this terrorist hell will live with them forever.</seg>
<seg id="10">Their greatest hope?</seg>
<seg id="11">That the war now scarring Ukraine - in which children like them are dying - will now stop.</seg>
<seg id="12">The girl pictured trying to climb back inside the blitzed school gym</seg>
<seg id="13">She was famously snapped by top Russian photographer Dmitry Beliakow fotografiert famously and by the time she only her underwear tried to climb back inside the blitzed school gym after a mine exploded.</seg>
<seg id="14">Bewildered, Aida was desperately searching for her mother, Larissa, now 40.</seg>
<seg id="15">Both were feared dead, but in fact they survived.</seg>
<seg id="16">'A woman told me to run for my life but I couldn't, 'said Aida at the time.</seg>
<seg id="17">My legs were covered in blood.</seg>
<seg id="18">I got up and climbed back in to look for my mum.</seg>
<seg id="19">A soldier plucked her to safety.</seg>
<seg id="20">After a series of surgeries, she thought she had totally recovered but said yesterday, however,: 'Three months ago, the pain came back.</seg>
<seg id="21">I fear I may need more surgery.</seg>

<seg id="23">Her aim now is to become a dentist, to help people as she has been aided by medics.</seg>
<seg id="24">'This tragedy changed my life but it surely did not break it, 'she said defiantly.</seg>
<seg id="25">'It happened to me and you can't change this fact.</seg>
<seg id="26">Once a year I always go to the gym to recall those who remained there.</seg>
<seg id="27">My friends and I try on other days not to talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="28">The pain is too much.</seg>
<seg id="29">My best friend and my classmate-to-be Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.</seg>
<seg id="30">We played together when we were small and dreamed of going to school together.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I don't want to marry until I finish my studies and start my career.</seg>
<seg id="32">I will think about a family later.</seg>
<seg id="33">She says the siege a little always with her though the memory every year remains.</seg>
<seg id="34">I am pleased that many people in the world still remember our troubles and we are so grateful for the help we got from people in Britain and everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="35">When I see online the photograph of me climbing into the school window, I think that many people will see it for the first time, understand about our disaster, and stop this from happening any more.</seg>
<seg id="36">The boy who fled through a hail of bullets believing his mother to be dead</seg>
<seg id="37">He was on his first day at (Russians start school aged 7 school) and survived the three day siege hugging his mum Tamara.</seg>
<seg id="38">Then seven he said: 'Mummy told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand.'</seg>
<seg id="39">After one explosion he thought she was dying.</seg>
<seg id="40">She told him: 'Run'.</seg>
<seg id="41">Fearing she was dead, he fled and the on his way he saw a crying toddler, grabbed the hand, and fled through a hail of bullets.</seg>
<seg id="42">His dad Vladimir, who scooped up his son outside, said: 'Damir told me his mother had died.</seg>
<seg id="43">He said: 'I couldn't save her' .'</seg>
<seg id="44">In fact, Tamara had stumbled free and was in hospital with leg wounds, in turn believing her son had perished.</seg>
<seg id="45">After their reunion she said: 'I wept with joy.</seg>
<seg id="46">I couldn't believe it.</seg>
<seg id="47">He ran in and hugged me.</seg>

<seg id="50">Still I can say that in my mind it is fading.</seg>
<seg id="51">I remember right afterwards, I threw away all my toy guns.</seg>
<seg id="52">But now I can play computer games with shooting and it is not a problem for me.</seg>
<seg id="53">'I'm not scared to go back in the gym but I don't think about myself.</seg>
<seg id="54">I remember those kids I used to play with in the yard, and who never got.</seg>
<seg id="55">We never say they were killed or dead.</seg>
<seg id="56">We say they stayed in the gym.</seg>
<seg id="57">I remember very good on my trip to London so, specially the toy shop where I was allowed to pick anything I wanted, and riding in an open top car.</seg>
<seg id="58">But now he fears for places like Ukraine where wars cause the kind of misery he and his friends suffered.</seg>
<seg id="59">This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop recalling it.</seg>
<seg id="60">'I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors, 'said Damir, who was last week doing voluntary work at a nunnery.</seg>
<seg id="61">I want to help so much.</seg>
<seg id="62">I want to serve in the police one day and hope they next year me to the training academy.</seg>
<seg id="63">His mother Tamara, 48, said: '37 kids were killed in our neighbourhood, can you imagine?</seg>
<seg id="64">I remember terrible silence right after the siege, there were just no children to shout and run around, and that silence lasted for many months.</seg>
<seg id="65">She vividly recalls her trip with Damir to London.</seg>
<seg id="66">People in London were crying when I told our story.</seg>
<seg id="67">I realised then how folk on the other side of the world can understand our feelings, can show their support.</seg>
<seg id="68">She was grateful to 'Cherie Blair and her foundation for that award and the opportunity to go to London in autumn 2004.</seg>
<seg id="69">I wish I could call Cherie and just say it myself that 10 years have gone but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.</seg>
<seg id="70">I remember borsch soup, when Damir wanted to eat, and they called all the local Russian restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="71">I remember how he was playing with waiters in a restaurant, Damir was shooting at them from his water pistol and they ran away and played with him.</seg>
<seg id="72">And we were just one month away from our horror then.</seg>
<seg id="73">I was amazed that the British people were so ready to share our pain and to support us.</seg>
<seg id="74">She said: 'I keep thinking this world not get better within these 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="75">Now in Ukraine the war goes on, people are dying every day, and I believe many children were killed and will be killed.</seg>
<seg id="76">They are just the same children, like ours.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think for many people the war is a news report they listen to when they are bored or busy with something else.</seg>
<seg id="78">I just know what those people feel, the horror of it.</seg>
<seg id="79">And I can't stop feeling it.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and it is so sad.</seg>
<seg id="81">Damir grew up and became a very gentle and calm boy, he is not at all aggressive or angry.</seg>
<seg id="82">He is not seeking revenge for example, he is not preoccupied with this past horror.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not like to recall it but he is very close with six classmates and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was smaller he suffered from it - I remember he used to lie down on the sofa with his face turned away from us, for hours at a time.</seg>
<seg id="85">Not sleeping, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I also remember how he threw away all his guns and other army-type toys.Damir is 17 now, taller than me, nice looking, clever and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">I can hardly believe that for some hours I so sure he was dead and I'd never see him again it was going to end.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I managed to recover after the explosion and got on my feet I looked around, I saw the hell around me, when body parts were lying everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely sure that there was no way my little boy could have survived in this hell.</seg>
<seg id="90">'I remember I was shouting to him 'Damir, run, run away' but again I was so sure he had not heard me.</seg>
<seg id="91">But he did hear, and he did run away.</seg>
<seg id="92">So life goes on the different than other vieler for us.</seg>
<seg id="93">Georgy Ilyin, 17</seg>
<seg id="94">The boy whose shocking image after the siege came to define the horror of Beslan</seg>
<seg id="95">Comfort: Beslan survivor Georgy Ilyin with his mum Fatima after the siege in 2004, while on the right is Georgy today</seg>
<seg id="96">His bloodstained face was etched with fear as he ran for his life as Chechen terrorists gunned down his classmates.</seg>
<seg id="97">His picture was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarity at Beslan.</seg>
<seg id="98">His mother Fatima, 54, a senior GP, had dropped him for his first day at school before rushing to take her elder son Vladimir to university.</seg>
<seg id="99">"I have a negative impact on left two minutes before the terrorists st√ºrmten him, so my little boy was left there alone for three days of horror, 'she recalled.</seg>
<seg id="100">Not completely alone, we had a family of relatives there but all of them were killed.</seg>
<seg id="101">Only my Georgy managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="102">The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="103">There is no single day when we do not recall this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="104">We do not feel it was long ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes from those days come to my mind all the time.</seg>
<seg id="105">Nobody will ever forget, I promise you.</seg>
<seg id="106">Haunting: The image of Georgy (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and has a statue (right) been immortalised in</seg>
<seg id="107">I remember Georgy on that day so much wanted to go to school. He wanted to, he said hug his teacher.</seg>
<seg id="108">I only got to know he was alive when I saw him TV.</seg>
<seg id="109">And now there is even a statue to crying Georgy in San Marino.</seg>
<seg id="110">Georgy does not like to look at this picture and it is hidden it in the bookcase in our home.</seg>
<seg id="111">I understand, but I also think that people from all over the world thanks to this picture feel our pain.</seg>
<seg id="112">Georgy says now: 'It's important this can never happen again.</seg>
<seg id="113">'I doubt we'll ever know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">People keep investigating such tragedies and never know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">Now they are investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Will we ever know what caused it?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world is moving to something very bad.</seg>
<seg id="118">"I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, no-one wants a war, so how does it happen?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing for such pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need dozens of years to pass in order to forget it.</seg>
<seg id="121">It affected my health and I still feel it.</seg>
<seg id="122">For about three or four years I had some nightmares because of the siege but then it got better.</seg>
<seg id="123">I went back to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.</seg>
<seg id="124">I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.</seg>
<seg id="125">This is why I keep going to the gym as each 1 September approaches.</seg>
<seg id="126">I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.</seg>
<seg id="127">It is hard for me to go inside the gym but I must do it.</seg>
<seg id="128">I do not feel myself a victim, this story is the part of my past now.</seg>
<seg id="129">I will not forget it but I do not feel sorry for myself.</seg>
<seg id="130">My life goes on.</seg>
<seg id="131">I finished school this year entered a medical university in Vladikavkaz.</seg>
<seg id="132">I will learn to be a heart surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="133">My first choice was to go in the army.</seg>
<seg id="134">I wanted to be a military man, but my health did not let me.</seg>
<seg id="135">I wanted to fight for my country but it will not happen.</seg>

<seg id="139">As the siege, he was pictured trapped inside the gym, sitting underway, at the foot of a murderous terrorist.</seg>
<seg id="140">It is truly a miracle he was not killed.</seg>
<seg id="141">'We feel as if it was just yesterday, 'said Georgy, who wanted to train as an intelligence officer in the FSB, but was due to his gesundheitlichen Sch√§den from the siege.</seg>
<seg id="142">It is still with me, this is not something I left behind.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am older now and people use to say children easily cope with bad experience - I must say this is not true.</seg>
<seg id="144">'In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I did feel a bit better afterwards but I can't forget it.</seg>
<seg id="145">And I would like to forget.</seg>
<seg id="146">2005 - the year after - was the first and the last time when I went inside the gym again.</seg>
<seg id="147">I lost consciousness.</seg>
<seg id="148">I would never ever go there again and please don't ask me to show where I sat in that well-known picture.</seg>

<seg id="150">My pain is enormous and I carry it with me every day.</seg>
<seg id="151">My friends know that I do not like to think or discuss it and they never asked me about the school.</seg>
<seg id="152">In terms of physical condition I am well.</seg>
<seg id="153">I should be careful with my knee which was injured but I walk fine now.</seg>
<seg id="154">Still my health did not let me go and study in FSB secret service academy in St Petersburg as I wanted.</seg>
<seg id="155">I sent my documents, including medical papers, and they replied it was not possible.</seg>
<seg id="156">My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have completed two years there.</seg>

<seg id="159">He said: 'I know I would never been able to children to of Erfahrungen report that it was going to end.</seg>
<seg id="160">This is not something children should know about, and of course not something they should experience erleiden not.</seg>
<seg id="161">His mother Marina, 42, said: 'This pain never leaves me.</seg>
<seg id="162">It is in my soul, worse when the anniversary gets close.</seg>
<seg id="163">I will go and attend ceremonies being held to mark it.</seg>
<seg id="164">I know Georgy won't go.</seg>
<seg id="165">It must be even stronger for him because he was there and I was not.</seg>
<seg id="166">I was waiting for him at home, not able to help.</seg>
<seg id="167">I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me.Here in Beslan the imprint is on everyone.</seg>
<seg id="168">It stays with us.</seg>
<seg id="169">Georgy is an adult now but that horror is still with him.</seg>
<seg id="170">It is hard to accept it when something so terribly unfair happens to you.</seg>
<seg id="171">He is a boy, he likes sports but he can't take part because of his knee.</seg>
<seg id="172">He had several surgeries, he walks but cannot exercise.</seg>
<seg id="173">I would say he 50% overcame this horror, but one can never completely overcome and forget it.</seg>
<seg id="174">This horrible experience will stay with us.</seg>
<seg id="175">Many friends and neighbours were killed in the siege, and it only adds to my pain.</seg>
<seg id="176">I lost many people I knew well and they were dear for me.</seg>
<seg id="177">My son is with me and this is the greatest gift God could do for me but my heart aches about those killed.</seg>
<seg id="178">I know families where new children were born, but also widows who never married again.</seg>
<seg id="179">It is hard to accept that life goes on, even if you do not want it.</seg>
<seg id="180">I will never forget my heart jumping out of my chest at the moment I saw him in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="181">Now I look at what is going on in the world - wars in different regions.</seg>
<seg id="182">What are those people fighting for?</seg>
<seg id="183">Why are they killing each other?</seg>
<seg id="184">The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.</seg>
<seg id="185">We used to be one friendly country in the past, how did it happen that we are fighting now?</seg>
<seg id="186">People and children are suffering, I am sure in Ukraine many children were already killed and many will be killed.</seg>
<seg id="187">If we could only grab all the rebels and throw them away - as far away as possible.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips for better underwater photos and video</seg>
<seg id="2">If you're interested in shooting photos or video underwater, you have a variety of equipment choices.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam, such as the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition, which both go for around $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I shot these photos at a family party using several cameras, all priced under $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">No matter what gear you use, a few rules apply for getting the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Double-check your gear.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera's battery and other compartments are tightly closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coffers your camera to the type of photos or video you aufnehmen to.</seg>
<seg id="9">Some cameras and camcorders have scene or shooting modes that will optimize the exposure for dim undersea settings.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in, know how deep your equipment can go.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are now only a collection of thought-provoking ideas rather than to to zugelassen 5 feet, others to 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Check out our buying guide and Ratings for digital cameras for both conventional and waterproof models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Take multiple shots - because many of them won't work.</seg>
<seg id="14">Point-and-shoot cameras have LCDs to help you compose photos, while action cams generally don't.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have an LCD, it's going to hard to see it underwater, and composing your shot will be a hit-or-miss process.</seg>
<seg id="16">So shoot multiples.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also, if your camera has a bracket mode, which shoots a burst of shots at slightly different, take advantage of it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay near the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">Light falls off dramatically the deeper you dive underwater.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, stay close to the surface when you shoot in a pool, a lake or the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">This will also allow you to capture more color in your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you'll see.</seg>
<seg id="22">Get close to your subjects.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is great advice for shooting on dry land, but it is even more important underwater because of the dim lighting conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It's particularly important if you're shooting with an action cam: These devices often have a fixed, wide angle lens, which means you have to get closer to your subjects if you want them to fill the picture frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was the kind of man of personality could things character. Whose changed, even in a gargantuan organisation like the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="2">A An√§sthesiearzt widmete he his career to sparing the sick both the agonies of illness and the torments of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among those who sought him out, his wife remembers, was an MI6 officer who had to live with the crippling after-effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson understood that while doctors captivated by diagnoses and diseases, are those being treated are overwhelmingly concerned with something else entirely: Pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I have not felt myself," he wrote in May that year.</seg>
<seg id="7">I've had difficulty in energising myself.</seg>
<seg id="8">Struggling with flu-like symptoms, he found himself impatiently berating his wife, Juliet.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want everything to happen sooner rather than later," he noted.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Juliet went away on business for a week, Lawson found himself unusually, and unaccountably, upset.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was up.</seg>
<seg id="12">He got a colleague to perform a chest X-ray.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks earlier he had been skiing in the French Alps.</seg>
<seg id="14">The results of the X-ray came back.</seg>
<seg id="15">He had mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or lining of the lung.</seg>
<seg id="16">With most cancers, it is hard to know the exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">Though some smokers get lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer sufferers have smoked.</seg>
<seg id="18">But mesothelioma is different.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost every case, the cause asbestos - a fibrous building material once again, who once dubbed "miraculous," but now known to be mortally dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us, mesothelioma has been an easy disease to ignore.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos, after all, is a product of the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when a voluntary industry ban came into effect.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even when it was used, only people in specific industries worked closely with it - pipe laggers, builders, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">An industrial toxin from another era, it hardly seems cause for concern today.</seg>
<seg id="25">But such complacency is misplaced.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it turns out, is today at the peak of a mesothelioma epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="27">There are more mesothelioma deaths here than in any other country on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="28">With an annual toll of about 2,500 double die many people in this disease as die in accidents in motor vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mesothelioma annual deaths since 1980 and projected future deaths in Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason that we are feeling its deadly effects now, though asbestos use has been illegal for years (all types banned by law in 1999), who is that usually takes decades for mesothelioma to develop.</seg>
<seg id="31">And the mesothelioma scourge is not confined to veterans of industrial building jobs.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos has been, and in many cases still is, embedded in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the in, the schools we are educated in, and the stores we shop in.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result, mesothelioma is no respecter of class, wealth, occupation, or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">The bastions of privilege, from smart London department stores to public schools, have proved no refuge.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Houses of Parliament are riddled with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even the hospitals that are meant to make us better have been reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">Nor was he a pipe lagger.</seg>
<seg id="39">In fact, he struggled to think where he might have come into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he put his finger on it.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It seems that there may have been in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital where I spent six years training, may have been a lot of asbestos," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">Everybody - students, nurses, doctors and porters - used the tunnels.</seg>
<seg id="43">One wonders how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">It was a question to which, sadly, he was able to provide a partial answer.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Of four doctors who trained at Guy's Hospital and, which is based in the past five years subsequently developed mesothelioma," he noted in a letter in 2010, "I am the only one left alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us will get the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died, on February 17 this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">To survive so long is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty per cent of mesothelioma sufferers are dead 8 months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is always fatal.</seg>
<seg id="52">We can only echo Lawson's question: "How many of us will get the same disease?"</seg>
<seg id="53">According to Britain's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, our best guess is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain should have some people will have died, 90,000 people.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most currently have no idea that they will die this way.</seg>
<seg id="55">An asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada Alamy</seg>
<seg id="56">A quick glance at the reports from the courts, where those affected often turn for compensation, shows how far the scourge of mesothelioma has spread.</seg>
<seg id="57">This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted negligently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, supervising clothes sections at two sites - one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs Allen was only 18 when she started working at M & S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now she has two children in their 20s.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Before this happened," she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="62">I never would have dreamed that I would be affected by it.</seg>
<seg id="63">Few people do know much about asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="64">In fact, asbestos describes not one substance but a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">They get their name from the word "asbestiform" - which describes the fibrous structure which endows them with strength and flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="66">Of the six, in the Baugewerbe verwendet.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotile, commonly known as White Asbestos, is today the by far the most frequently found in buildings.</seg>
<seg id="68">It was used in roofing panels, floor tiles, pipe insulation, boiler seals, even brake linings in cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but that can kill by the EU and WHO considered a "major health hazard" m√∂glicher Todesfolge angesehen.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, are Brown Asbestos (amosite) and Blue Asbestos (crocidolite).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of Brown Asbestos, and experts suggest that "there is strong but indirect evidence that this was a major cause of the uniquely high mesothelioma rate [in the UK]."</seg>
<seg id="72">A Marks & Spencer employee was exposed to asbestos at its flagship store in Oxford Street, London Alamy</seg>
<seg id="73">Janice Allen may not have thought of herself as a typical victim, but the of work Julian Peto's that her story is far from uncommon.</seg>
<seg id="74">He has produced a study of sufferers which suggests that "a substantial proportion of mesotheliomas with no known occupational or domestic exposure were probably caused by environmental asbestos exposure."</seg>
<seg id="75">Much of that exposure, he says, is due to "normal occupation and weathering" of our buildings.</seg>
<seg id="76">It seems that there may have been, one of ausgehen, when it comes to be sure.</seg>
<seg id="77">A report from Goddard Consulting, which looked at the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the heart of government, might have been exposed unawares.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009 Goddard reported that service shafts and piping ducts behind Parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose lethal fibres disturbed by something as innocuous as "strong currents of air" could be.</seg>
<seg id="79">MPs are frequently accused of looking after their own interests, but in this case it seems the opposite may have been true.</seg>
<seg id="80">While the Parliamentary Works Services Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster had a "sauberes given", it is now accepted ¬£1bn of work lasting several years is required to overhaul Parliament, Elektroinstallationen modernisieren to the and entfernen to asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election MPs may sit in the nearby presumed that the to think nahegelegenen in the QE2-Konferenzzentrum treffen, the riders could acquire cold drinks than on the Green Benches at Westminster.</seg>
<seg id="81">The Goddard report noted that "the presence of asbestos has not been managed in accordance with the various regulations."</seg>
<seg id="82">It is impossible to know if this mismanagement will cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All anyone can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">One person who has asbestos never been able to pinpoint his exposure to is Graham Abbott, a GP.</seg>
<seg id="85">Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects that he while working in hospitals was exposed to asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I have worked at a hospital where positive asbestos claims have been made," he says, "But I can't prove it in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It's so hard to remember all the places one has worked in, and the dates.</seg>
<seg id="88">What he remembers clearly is the day early in December in 2009 when he was overcome with what felt like a fever.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and in the middle of a late evening surgery.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly I started feeling shivery.</seg>
<seg id="91">It came on very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt dreadful.</seg>
<seg id="93">I didn't think I was all the way home to be able to drive.</seg>
<seg id="94">Being a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from the pleura, the lining around his lungs.</seg>
<seg id="95">But like Janice Allen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="96">He ended up spending a month off work.</seg>
<seg id="97">Puzzled doctors gave him chest X-rays, and administered pleural catheters to draw off fluid from the lungs and send it for assessment.</seg>
<seg id="98">Yet the condition went undiagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="99">Slowly his health improved and he went back to work.</seg>
<seg id="100">But from time to time the same symptoms returned, often after he took exercise and was breathing hard.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, one of Abbott's patients arrived at his GP's surgery and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="102">But even then Abbott didn't make the connection with his own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">After all, his patient was decades older, and had worked directly asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">The link in that case was clear.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his consultant took his CT scans and X-rays to a panel of experts.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott started feeling unwell, a probe, equipped with a camera, was fed into the cavity between the lining of his chest and the lining of his lung.</seg>
<seg id="107">I'm an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I tend just to plod along, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="109">Ehrlich said, however, I hadn't worried about it too much to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife, was worrying.</seg>
<seg id="111">The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham Abbott: Diagnosed with mesothelioma</seg>
<seg id="113">Suddenly Abbott was plunged into meetings with Macmillan nurses, one of whom suggested that he should get in touch with a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">That was when he realised the scale of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turns out that asbestos was widely used, particularly in big public buildings which quite often had asbestos lagging on the pipes," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">People, the asbestos in those buildings, were exposed to get this disease now.</seg>
<seg id="117">So mesothelioma is now affecting younger people not in the typical professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous asbestos-lagged pipes in hospitals were below ground level, so patients are unlikely to have been affected.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many staff, walking in pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson), or eating in basement canteens (as Graham Abbott frequently did) almost certainly did come into contact with the toxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="120">For several decades after the war, it turns out, hospitals were potentially life-saving places for patients, but life-threatening places for the doctors who treated them.</seg>
<seg id="121">It is still being removed today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Pupils perched their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats</seg>
<seg id="123">And it is not just hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was halls for its marvellous insulating and flammhemmenden qualities frequently used in offices, shops, libraries and Stadthallen verwendet.</seg>
<seg id="125">Schools too.</seg>
<seg id="126">In fact many people will have been first exposed to asbestos in the classroom.</seg>
<seg id="127">Up and down the country, in myriad chemistry lessons, pupils have perched their Bunsen burners on asbestos mats.</seg>
<seg id="128">Websites have sprung up to address the issue of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">And so have Meanwhile, in our homes, items as floor tiles or Schuppend√§cher contained asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"It's an industrial poison built into large amounts of our housing stock," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his case against Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case was the only contact the woman sufferer could think of pulling down a garden shed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So be careful how you pull down the garden shed.</seg>
<seg id="133">The impact of diagnosis, knowing that the disease is incurable, is huge.</seg>
<seg id="134">"It takes a while to sink in," says Graham Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to carry on but realised that I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.</seg>
<seg id="136">I was at the surgery for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I realised that I would have to leave and sort myself out.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I won't see Christmas again.</seg>
<seg id="139">One of the hardest things was moving from the position of doctor to that of patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">Like countless patients before him, he remembers feeling bewildered by the amount of information to get to grips with.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was hard to take everything in," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked my consultant" How long do I have? "</seg>
<seg id="143">I was quoted about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember thinking "Well, I won't see Christmas again.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's it. ""</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly pernicious, because it mechanics of how we stay alive - the very act of breathing - is that causes the cancer that kills.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most Mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="148">Asbestos is made up of tiny fibres.</seg>
<seg id="149">When the asbestos is disturbed and the fibres are inhaled, they can become embedded in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="150">Asbestos fibres irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem comes from inhaled needle-shaped fibres of asbestos," Professor Tom Treasure, a cardio-thoracic surgeon who moved in 2001 to Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="152">The very hospital where Andrew Lawson suspected he was exposed to asbestos is now, ironically, a leading centre in treating mesothelioma.</seg>
<seg id="153">Treasure knew Lawson, and treated some others who are likely to have while training at the hospital exposed to asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="154">Once the asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, says Treasure, "the act of breathing pushes them on the periphery, which is where the lining is.</seg>
<seg id="155">It is by its nature invasive from the very beginning.</seg>
<seg id="156">The normal options for treating other Krebserkrankungen funktionieren with mesothelioma is not as well.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of surgery, for example, for example, is hotly debated.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some feel it is worth trying.</seg>
<seg id="159">Treasure disagrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">"You can't excise the pleura," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">You can't get your knife round it.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile the cancer "is not very responsive to chemotherapy," which "has an effect" but does not cure.</seg>
<seg id="163">"Every now and again you get long survivors," says Treasure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But in the end they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Happily, some patients do live far, far beyond expectations.</seg>
<seg id="166">The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two-and-a-half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still battling on.</seg>
<seg id="168">After contacting mesothelioma Abbott was put in touch with Andrew Lawson, who, four years after his diagnosis, had become a one-man support and advice bureau for fellow sufferers.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Hello, Cancer Central," he would announce cheerily when they called.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," says Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="171">He had been diagnosed 4 years before and was still very active.</seg>
<seg id="172">Initially, Abbott had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy take four months, and likely prolong his life by just one month that would.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I felt desperate," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I felt like giving up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, however, "managed to things to put a slightly better tint on".</seg>
<seg id="176">After seeing several consultants, Abbott decided to pursue his treatment with Prof Loic Lang-Lazdunski, professor in thoracic surgery at Guy's.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage in that I didn't have to be referred, I just rang them up and they saw me," Graham admits.</seg>
<seg id="178">The average patient would have to get a referral and have funding approved.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money is crucial for those with mesothelioma to pursue the best available treatments.</seg>
<seg id="180">But when those treatments eventually, inevitably, fail, many sufferers are faced with another financial worry - about the future of the families they will leave behind.</seg>
<seg id="181">And so they turn to the courts in pursuit of compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan, from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It has been unconscious since 1898 has been known that asbestos is noxious to health," says Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But what changed in the 1960s is that it was realised that even very low levels could be a risk to health.</seg>
<seg id="185">That is where company negligence came in.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and Guy's hospital eventually settled their case, but it was not what Morgan calls a "full-value settlement" since Lawson could not prove definitively that his mesothelioma to asbestos exposure at Guy's was down.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the inquest into his death, a spokesman for Guy's did confirm, however, that "the asbestos in the health systems of affected Kellerbereich in the 1990ern away,".</seg>
<seg id="188">That was too late for Andrew Lawson.</seg>
<seg id="189">How to remove asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">In fact for mesothelioma sufferers seeking compensation - has proved a huge problem, pinning lethal asbestos exposure on one company or place of work - usually decades after the fact - has proved.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have changed hands or gone out of business.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance records may have been lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And the those defending themselves from claims know they have time on their side, which the claimants certainly do not.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, this year has seen major new legislation which makes it easier for those with mesothelioma to claim compensation even if their former employers can no longer be traced.</seg>
<seg id="195">The law has created a Versicherungsindustrie by the gef√∂rderten Fonds of, for those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove exposure but have no one to sue.</seg>
<seg id="196">In these cases sufferers will be awarded 80 per cent of what a court in a normal compensation case might have awarded - about ¬£120,000.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful claims to the scheme are expected each year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan, like many involved with mesothelioma sufferers, thinks that ¬£350m represents "a very good job" for the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"It's a deal written by insurers for insurers" he says, suggesting that the sum is a quarter of, what insurers would have had to pay if the passage of time had not intervened, and mesothelioma sufferers the track down companies and sue them.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even Mike Penning, then Works and Pensions minister, admitted that the law was "not perfect."</seg>
<seg id="201">But both Penning and Morgan admit that, with seven victims dying each day, quick action was needed.</seg>
<seg id="202">"People are suffering so much, and need help today," said Penning during the Mesothelioma Bill's second reading in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">By then, Graham Abbott had been 19 months spent in the hands of Prof Loic Lang-Lazdunski for.</seg>
<seg id="204">After their initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski advised surgery, for example, given punishments like, for example, in contrast to Tom Treasure, he has a positive effect.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy - a tri-therapy for which Lang-Lazdunski advised five year survival rates as high as of years to 40 per cent to pr√§sentieren can.</seg>
<seg id="206">Abbott felt empowered.</seg>
<seg id="207">"That of course is with the Wichtigste," says Abbott.</seg>
<seg id="208">You see it in patients all the time.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is some drive that keeps you going.</seg>
<seg id="210">When you give up you can deteriorate very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham Abbott went in for surgery in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">By the end of August he had the last of his six cycles of chemotherapy, behind.</seg>
<seg id="213">Follow-up scans revealed no sign of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had my scan in March [2014].</seg>
<seg id="215">There was multiple spotting [of cancer] around my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I was just about to turn 50.</seg>
<seg id="217">It's not life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="218">It's life ending.</seg>
<seg id="219">Once again Abbott put himself through six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now there is no sign of the tumours.</seg>
<seg id="221">But the process is both physically and emotionally gruelling.</seg>
<seg id="222">You have to think about practical things - about the finances when I'm gone for example, or showing my wife how the boiler timer works.</seg>
<seg id="223">When you get bad news you start getting negative.</seg>
<seg id="224">You have to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="225">As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, that is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">"It's hard as a parent," he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It is hard to know what to say and how much to say.</seg>
<seg id="228">When I was first diagnosed I told the girls that I had a condition that meant I wasn't going to become old.</seg>
<seg id="229">They reacted very differently.</seg>
<seg id="230">Tamsin is very sociable and boisterous.</seg>
<seg id="231">She told her friends and we got lots of calls very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="232">Ellie was more reserved.</seg>
<seg id="233">She didn't say much.</seg>
<seg id="234">Such conversations are something that all cancer patients must face.</seg>
<seg id="235">But for mesothelioma sufferers such discussions are not leavened by hope, by even a glimmer of pursuit of survival.</seg>
<seg id="236">The disease carries with it (even as it did, eventually, for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim certainty.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses to give Hong Kong right to choose leaders; protesters vow vengeance</seg>
<seg id="2">China's parliament decided Sunday, despite growing agitation for democratic reform against the voters nominate candidates for the 2017 election Hong Kong W√§hlerschaft.</seg>
<seg id="3">The move is likely to spark long-promised protests in Hong Kong's business district, as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision by China's National People's Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to weed out any candidates not loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's not unexpected, but it is still infuriating," said legislator Emily Lau, chairwoman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is not what Beijing promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">They've lied to the people of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it's clear we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defending China's ruling, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the St√§ndigen Ausschusses Committee of the National, said allowing public nominations in the election for Hong Kong's leader would be too "chaotic."</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing had promised to allow the region's residents to vote for the chief executive beginning in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">The Chinese leaders presented the Sunday ruling as a democratic breakthrough because it, as well as the B√ºrgern of a Hong Kong is direktes Wahlrecht, but the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders would retain a firm hold on the process through a nominating by Beijing committee tightly controlled.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, according to a new clause, only candidates who "love the country, and love Hong Kong" would be allowed.</seg>
<seg id="13">The ruling comes after a summer that the some of the largest and most high-profile protests in Hong Kong in years stattfanden.</seg>
<seg id="14">Behind much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not grant authentic universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday night, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had assembled in the rain outside the Hong Kong government's headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the demonstration, organizers said that their movement was entering a new stage of civil disobedience and that they in the coming weeks would mount waves of protests.</seg>
<seg id="17">She However, they did not give details, apparently looking to problems with authorities.</seg>
<seg id="18">In an online statement, organizers said the movement "has considered occupying Central only as the last resort, an action to be taken only if all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We are very sorry to say that today all chances of dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of Central will definitely happen.</seg>
<seg id="20">Authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and security was tight Sunday at the government headquarters, with police and barricades deployed.</seg>
<seg id="21">Driving the unrest is a sense among many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control over their city.</seg>
<seg id="22">An influx of mainlanders is fueling competition for products and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">There is also growing fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, with those rights under increasing pressure from Beijing are beginning to bend under.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying its demonstrations put business - the lifeblood of Hong Kong - at risk.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protest they are talking about, it could result in much economic damage, depending on how many are involved and how long," said legislator Regina Ip, who has held high office over the movement has long criticized.</seg>
<seg id="26">We don't want concern to spread that Hong Kong is getting out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This is a perception that is bad for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">China's state-run media also has run stories in recent days painting Hong Kong's democracy activists as agents of subversion directed by Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights that drew 780,000 participants - more than a fifth of Hong Kong voters.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in July, tens of thousands turned out for one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region's history.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists take on race and police conduct post-Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">The unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">Attendees hold their hands up while chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot," as they wait in line before the funeral.</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo. over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in the online conversation among white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">In her experience, white feminist commenters prioritized gender above race when it came to pushing forward reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">But as tensions rose in the Midwest and drew nationwide coverage, Perez saw responses from white women that centered 100 percent around race.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared to the responses of black women soon after the shooting on August 9, the personal essays with titles like "thoughts on ferguson as a white woman" and "Feminism Is Not Just About Women's Oppression" came relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But to Perez, it demonstrated a significant shift.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I don't think you feminism in a lot of people talking about whiteness and privilege," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People felt called to voice something about what happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's very emblematic of the crisis we face and because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racialized, they have to call that out.</seg>
<seg id="12">For Ohio State University English professor Koritha Mitchell that the, Ferguson brought to light issues that black American women face every day aren't but as "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can post something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner and it will get 150 likes from all over the place," said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">When I post something about how people of color are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.</seg>
<seg id="15">"How is it safe for women to speak publicly about relationships but not about safety in the public sphere?" She asked.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women like Mitchell who race, gender and sexuality in U.S. history have studied, there is no dichotomy between issues regarding race and gender.</seg>
<seg id="17">To her, black women have not had the luxury of neatly separating the issues; they live the combined reality every day.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women are now combining issues of race and gender in mainstream feminist spheres, Angela Hattery, women and gender studies professor at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="20">You needed the white woman to be complicit in the narrative to justify the lynching.</seg>
<seg id="21">To Hattery, the breakdown between white and black women the came when white suffragists like Susan B. Anthony surveyed the landscape in the late 1800s and saw that the fight for voting rights would only work for one group at a time: Women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They made the decision to put their eggs in and for voting rights would blacks should be come later," said Hattery.</seg>
<seg id="23">To look back at things like that gives us a powerful perspective on why women of color don't trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We haven't done a good job.</seg>
<seg id="25">We haven't helped black women protect their husbands and sons ever.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took a decade for white women to organize against lynching as the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.</seg>
<seg id="27">The group came nearly 40 years after originally asked for assistance black women, said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">To Mitchell, the upswell of white feminist responses to the issues raised by Ferguson - police conduct, racial discrimination - reflect the times white feminists have had to play "catch up" to issues black women have grappled with for generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have those [traditional feminist] platforms took as seriously the right to raise a child as they did their right to have birth control?" Posed Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="30">Second wave feminists who fighting for reproductive rights and access to birth Mitteln aufbauten are now figuring out what that means.</seg>
<seg id="31">Noted white feminist activist Gloria Steinem took went two weeks after Michael Brown's shooting on Facebook and shooting to post a pointed column by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll that demanded more protest from white Americans on the issue of racism.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope women, who have a different but parallel reason for a, the body danger understanding to - and racial opinions that are measurably different in public polls - will lead the change," Steinem wrote.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Steinem has vouched for a more intersectional feminism that includes issues of race as well, for example, some of her comment on race in America still verbl√ºfft.</seg>
<seg id="34">She has launched in the American Enterprise Institute Autorin of "Who Stole Feminism?," told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are "far more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's remarks on Ferguson to are in contrast to their former criticism.</seg>
<seg id="35">We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">But when the White House recently initiated a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable black and Hispanic young men, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.</seg>
<seg id="37">Police relations with the black community is not the only issue pushing to the forefront of mainstream feminism.</seg>
<seg id="38">After U.S. border patrol apprehended nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country's southwest border this year, immigration reform surfaced once again - this time as a women's issue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization mobilizing women for immigration reform, said that for a Neubetrachtung of the Themas wesentliches as a women's issue she needed to do was share immigrant women's stories.</seg>
<seg id="40">"They speak for themselves," Mercado said.</seg>
<seg id="41">When the vast majority of employment visas are given to [male immigrants], the women who come with them are left in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="42">"These stories resonate with women's organizations," she said.</seg>

<seg id="1">Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed</seg>
<seg id="2">A British woman says she thought of shrinking bills as a Fehldiagnose over the next few years many that she was going to die.</seg>
<seg id="3">Karin Rodgers spent most of her teenage life believing that she only had years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.</seg>
<seg id="4">She actually had Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.</seg>
<seg id="5">Charity CMT UK said that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because so little is known about the condition.</seg>
<seg id="6">About 23,000 people in the UK are thought to have CMT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, an awkward gait and curled toes.</seg>
<seg id="7">Sufferers can also experience numbness or pain and the condition is incurable and progressive, meaning symptoms get worse over time.</seg>
<seg id="8">When Rodgers was 13 she was under the impression that she suffered from Friedreich's ataxia (FA) - a condition which had a very poor prognosis.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rodgers thought that she was going to be wheelchair bound by the time she was 18 and dead before she reached her 30s.</seg>
<seg id="10">The mother-of-two, who is now 51, said: "As a child I knew I couldn't do the same things as others.</seg>
<seg id="11">I was falling daily and everything took me longer to do.</seg>
<seg id="12">I could never with the other children Skateboard or Rollschuh'll go on and has at school a lot because of the what passers-by described as I walked and ran.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rodgers said when in the she was aged 13, after several operations to release her Achilles tendons and straighten out her her feet, she took notes when her consultant left the room at that she suffered from FA.</seg>
<seg id="14">"I felt guilty because I'd been nosy and so I didn't tell anybody, but I did come home, look up the condition at the library and wrote to the FA Association," she said.</seg>
<seg id="15">When I got the information back I was gobsmacked and in the worst state of panic possible.</seg>
<seg id="16">I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18 and dead by the time I was 25 and in between gradually lose all my ability.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was going through this on my own and I planned my own funeral.</seg>
<seg id="18">She said by the time she reached 17 she realised that her walking abilities hadn't deteriorated as much as the castle garden, she thought they would have and asked her surgeon.</seg>
<seg id="19">He just stood up and hugged me and said 'my dear I don't think you have it, as you w√§rst here so now to be wheelchair. "</seg>
<seg id="20">I think you have something a lot less life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="21">After some genetic testing she was found to have CMT.</seg>
<seg id="22">"When he explained what CMT was, I thought I'd drawn the lucky straw," she said.</seg>
<seg id="23">Charity CMT UK has launched CMT awareness month to try to draw attention to the condition.</seg>

<seg id="1">Washington-area business owners "tax burden mounts as economy rebounds</seg>
<seg id="2">A rebounding economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">State and local tax bills for companies across the country grew modestly last year as the economic recovery accelerated, according to new research released last week, and Washington-area firms were no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">District, Maryland and Virginia businesses collectively paid $27.6 billion to state and local coffers in fiscal 2013, an increase of 3.8 percent over the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">Businesses "state and local tax burdens last year expanded by 4.3 percent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 percent the year before, and it was the third consecutive year of growth in after back-to-back years of shrinking bills 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">State taxes rose at a faster clip, than local levies, 3.9 4.3 percent, according to the study, which was conducted by professional services firm Ernst & Young and the Center on State Taxation, a tax policy group.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the District's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from business taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from firms.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia, at 28 percent, generates the least amount of tax revenue, proportionately, from business.</seg>
<seg id="10">Much of the growth in tax revenue is being driven by a rebound companies "real estate values, researchers say, which pushed property taxes up 3.7 percent this year after three aufeinanderfolgenden Wachstumsraten with years of less than $1 percent growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large share of those gains came from big states such as California, New York and Texas, it appears to be the same story in the Washington area as well.</seg>
<seg id="12">Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively forked over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up from $9.6 billion in 2012 - year-over-year growth of 4.2 percent.</seg>
<seg id="13">But the apparent bounceback in property values isn't doing nearly in Maryland as much to inflate state and local tax revenues, where property taxes amount to barely more than a fifth of companies "tax bills.</seg>
<seg id="14">Virginia and D.C. firms pay nearly half of their state and local tax bills in the form of property taxes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"What's happening in Maryland is that so much of their property, especially the tax base surrounding the D.C. area, is owned either by the government or by nonprofits, which don't pay property taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">So Maryland is forced to rely much more heavily on, for example, its income taxes to pay for the same services you have in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent rebound in business tax revenue to the economy rebounds of the Immobilienmarktes zugerechnet, the riders could acquire cold drinks</seg>
<seg id="18">Business incomes also appear to be on the mend, according to the data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Companies in the region reported state corporate income taxes of $2.3 billion, up from $2.1 billion in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland collected $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, the most in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">While trending in the same direction, the local tax burden on businesses't growing at the same pace in all three Orten evenly take part in the banning submission.</seg>
<seg id="22">The District's rate of growth was the national average, at 4.3 percent, while Maryland's growth was substantially faster at 4.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only Virginia posted a below-average tax bill bump of 4.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="24">Virginia has the three jurisdictions the lowest corporate income tax by far in (all the three there is feste Unternehmenssteuers√§tze).</seg>
<seg id="25">Maryland's corporate rate is 8.25 percent, while the District's stands at a relatively high 9.975 percent.</seg>
<seg id="26">A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia had lower state and local business taxes, the riders could acquire cold drinks demands as a and a better Steuerklima established here than Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="27">The District wasn't evaluated in the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite the Vorteile, Virginia is bright lights during the wide range of his pressure from its neighbor to the south.</seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina recently signed legislation lowering its corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, in line with Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.</seg>
<seg id="30">If the state Einkommensziele his still in the coming year, the law could this, as well as the state's Unternehmenseinkommenssteuersatz to be widened into two lanes over to vote income tax rate as low as 3 percent by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="31">Meanwhile, it appears that the small businesses in the Washington Washington to be better and thus paying more state and local taxes, according to the recent study.</seg>
<seg id="32">Business taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business owners - the pass-through structure by which most small firms are organized - in the District, Maryland and Virginia surged 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a much faster rate of growth than overall business taxes.</seg>
<seg id="33">Researchers say that trend and the increase in business taxes nationwide are likely to continue this year, with overall sales tax revenue for state and local governments up 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared with the same period last year.</seg>
<seg id="34">However, the Washington area may lag behind as the slowdown in federal spending takes its toll on the region's labor market.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion</seg>
<seg id="2">AMAZON just confirmed what the Information reported Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a hundred other things - is buying video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).</seg>
<seg id="3">The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to be bought, but because YouTube was widely expected to be the buyer.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago, looked all wrapped up, the sale of Twitch to Google's video service for a cool billion, and the pairing seemed natural.</seg>
<seg id="5">Twitch, the only three years ago as Justin.tv, which was founded and described as was set out to be a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="6">Instead it quickly became a platform for gamers to broadcast their, Bravourst√ºcke games in feats; a "YouTube for live gaming," in Business Insider's words.</seg>
<seg id="7">Twitch's interface.</seg>
<seg id="8">And "let's play," a genre of videos in which wiseacres give (mostly older) games the Mystery Science Theater treatment, are already popular on YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="9">The point is, YouTube were a lot when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube was Twitch was greeted with a yawn comes up a lot, tech company buying out a potential competitor.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube fell through, considering it was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">All we have at the moment is this statement from Twitch CEO Emmett Shear: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us get, there faster."</seg>
<seg id="12">Another mystery, frankly, is Twitch's incredible success.</seg>
<seg id="13">To snobs like me who declare that they'd rather play sports than watch them, it's hard to see the appeal of watching games rather than taking up a controller myself.</seg>
<seg id="14">It's one thing to look over your friend's shoulder at 3 in the morning another to watch some as she creeps through Resident Evil, and quite a rando get 20 headshots in row in Call of Duty.</seg>
<seg id="15">All the games you could be watching right now.</seg>
<seg id="16">Another problem is that many of today's most popular games are first-person, so watching footage of them, without controlling the viewpoint yourself, can be a Do It Right-worthy recipe for a headache.</seg>
<seg id="17">I concede that speedruns, in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time, are entertaining.</seg>
<seg id="18">But unless someone is a virtuoso at gaming or humour, his Twitch channel isn't likely to be all that interesting.</seg>
<seg id="19">But what do sceptics like me know?</seg>
<seg id="20">Twitch has 55 million unique visitors monthly and is the fourth-largest source of peak internet traffic.</seg>
<seg id="21">And, will Amazon capitalise on this?</seg>
<seg id="22">It's hard to imagine Twitch being folded into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have just swallowed Twitch.</seg>
<seg id="23">But Twitch has something any company would love to attract: Hordes of young men, as the Werbekunden umworben.</seg>
<seg id="24">As Twitch chief Shear said, Amazon and Twitch "are both believers in the future of gaming," and the medium shows no sign of a Schrumpfung, even - gulp - as a sport.</seg>

<seg id="9">Well, you make your own fun anyway.</seg>
<seg id="10">This was already apparent early on Saturday when the first visitors set off for the open air.</seg>
<seg id="11">A festival fit for all generations organizers promised.</seg>
<seg id="12">And that is what they delivered.</seg>
<seg id="13">Around the supplies stand located in the meadows of the castle garden, people from Salzwedel, but also guests from near and far, made themselves at home.</seg>
<seg id="14">They followed the first live performance, tapped their with the feet in time, and. In short: Pure relaxation and enjoyment.</seg>
<seg id="15">And that goes for all generations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Whilst some people sprawled out on blankets placed on top of the white sand around the beach bar, which had been carted in especially, others indulged in a glass of wine in the wine store, and the kids went crazy on the bouncy castle, which was a huge attraction for the little guests.</seg>
<seg id="17">However, even the children's face painting kept the volunteers' in the strictest meaning of the word 'hands full children rushed to become men, and conjure up fanciful creations on the on their small faces.</seg>
<seg id="18">The more grown up ones played on the football table or took part in a skateboard workshop, which the Goodfoot-Crew from Salzwedel had organized.</seg>
<seg id="19">And then the rain came.</seg>
<seg id="20">Shortly before 5: 30 PM the rain pelted down onto the visitors; families did a runner in search of somewhere dry and.</seg>
<seg id="21">Despite this, the festival's attractions did not get called off.</seg>
<seg id="22">"More people than expected came", Rom Sem said, who called the event a "success all round".</seg>
<seg id="23">As such, them from repeating the big party next year, nothing is going to stop them.</seg>
<seg id="24">Even though more has to the size and content of the event, when it comes to be done in terms of the first balance sheet done on Sunday made a lot of the Volksstimme.</seg>

<seg id="26">Apparently been booked with the security company not enough security guards had.</seg>
<seg id="27">The consequence: Some people who had already paid could no longer get into the grounds.</seg>
<seg id="28">Feedback has been very good.</seg>
<seg id="29">In a preliminary and cautious estimation, the Salzwedel co-organizer estimated that around 1200 visitors attended the castle garden.</seg>
<seg id="30">There were problems with the sound engineering.</seg>
<seg id="31">The hip Hip-Hop-Band Blocks`n`Rox brach their performance somewhat unnerved by these problems.</seg>
<seg id="32">The engineers could not get a half-decent sound out of it.</seg>
<seg id="33">The geplanten Shisha-Lounges could not be built because the tents could be delivered to Salzwedel due to a Reifenpanne could not be delivered to Salzwedel after could be taken.</seg>
<seg id="34">"In next year they will be however,", according to the organizers.</seg>
<seg id="35">The premier of the Amula-Open-Airs was in terms of the number of more than they delivered.</seg>
<seg id="36">And that was with bad weather.</seg>
<seg id="37">Nevertheless, the organizers have made some mistakes, which excused as it was their first time, but which have to be avoided next time round.</seg>
<seg id="38">The social networking site Facebook organizers also had to accept criticism on.</seg>
<seg id="39">"Sorry, but for twelve euros, I really expected more", Melanie Meier commented on the event's page.</seg>
<seg id="40">"Unfortunately, you bit off more than you could chew", according to Ele Zimmermann on the same page.</seg>
<seg id="41">For others, the teething problems were not such a big issue.</seg>
<seg id="42">I think it is really good that some people are not just standing around talking rubbish, but are actually making a real effort to get something up and running.</seg>

<seg id="1">Will the Burgvereine (castle clubs) get back together again?</seg>
<seg id="2">Recently there have been a lot of disputes between both of the castle groups in Wolfratshausen.</seg>
<seg id="3">The boardroom is now contemplating the possibility of working together.</seg>
<seg id="4">As an example for the reconstruction of the castle in Wolfratshausen, the deceased Richard Dimbath, the former chairmen of Wolfratshauser Burgfreunde (Wolfratshausen castle friends), led the project in the French Gu√©delon.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up until a year ago, there was a good atmosphere among the castle club and the castle friends group in Wolfratshausen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Their points of view are now markedly different with regard to how the history of Wolfratshausen castle and the possible reconstruction of it should be handled.</seg>
<seg id="7">Now the two are coming together: There should soon be talks about a joint venture.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both members of the board, confirmed Torsten Sj√∂berg (castle club) and Herbert Piffl (castle friends), in answer to our newspaper's query.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I have rung Mr Piffl and suggested that we get together", Sj√∂berg reported.</seg>
<seg id="10">In his opinion, all members of each club could come together again in the future.</seg>
<seg id="11">This would enable quicker and more visible success to be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="12">Whereas the castle friends, and the recently deceased Richard Dimbath right up until the bitter end to their eyes on reconstructing the castle mountain forest, the castle club, with Sj√∂berg, want to the "develop and bring the" Gel√§ndes vorderster to Stelle.</seg>
<seg id="13">Herbert Piffl, the deputy chairman of castle friends, decided to set up to own after over the very Anruf gefreut.</seg>
<seg id="14">He has been presiding over castle friends since the death of Dimbath.</seg>
<seg id="15">A new chairperson will mid September during a members' meeting will be found.</seg>
<seg id="16">At the moment, the club according to the 74-J√§hrigen around 40 members of.</seg>
<seg id="17">"After the death of my friend, Richard Dimbath, we adjourned the club from's activities initially out of respect". This "Denkphase" has been necessary to "think about how it can proceed".</seg>
<seg id="18">According to Piffl, the new chairperson will then enter into discussions with the castle club.</seg>
<seg id="19">Until then, the castle friends can get on with the current atmospheric picture within their group.</seg>
<seg id="20">He candidates for the there is the moment, they still do not Piffl said.</seg>
<seg id="21">"However, I am confident that we will find someone". He himself does not want to stand for it because he lives in Bad T√∂lz.</seg>
<seg id="22">The new chairperson should be in Wolfratshausen.</seg>
<seg id="23">The man from T√∂lz would take part in the project "like to continue working with them".</seg>
<seg id="24">The different points of view subject of reconstruction will when it comes to questions about technology in the Piffls presumed that the time in n√§chster bestehen for him.</seg>
<seg id="25">He acknowledges Dimbath as a "missionary", who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Two similar projects, which are well under way in Austria and France, show that this idea is no easy task.</seg>
<seg id="27">But with a high number of participants among the population, as well as some volunteers from all over the world, it will become a tourist magnet.</seg>
<seg id="28">Piffl: "Even I was skeptical at first.</seg>
<seg id="29">However, with time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to press ahead with the project ". It could create a" unique characteristic "for the city of raftsmen.</seg>
<seg id="30">Otherwise, there is nothing here.</seg>
<seg id="31">, the project would be financed by EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.</seg>
<seg id="32">"The idea of reconstruction is, therefore, something that I personally do not want to simply abandon. He hopes that the castle club will move towards this idea somewhat.</seg>
<seg id="33">Their aim to first of all document the history "is important and good".</seg>
<seg id="34">Then, we will see.</seg>

<seg id="1">Smart ways to save on college textbooks</seg>
<seg id="2">With the cost of college for many students textbooks surpassing $1,000 a year, soon-to-be sophomore Matt Schroeder came up with a smart way to trim costs.</seg>

<seg id="21">The book was selling for $48 new.</seg>

<seg id="32">E-books</seg>
<seg id="33">Getting e-books instead of traditional texts is another option.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sometimes those books are essentially rented by providing the electronic license for a specific period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.</seg>
<seg id="35">Chegg will rent "Calculus" for six months for about $61.</seg>

<seg id="1">After its second win of the season, H√ºtteldorf is in third place on the table.</seg>
<seg id="2">2: 0 win over to an end for Rapid A bitter week came on Sunday with a Gr√∂dig.</seg>
<seg id="3">"The victory is very liberating", according to Coach Zoran Barisic, whose team interim low at the end of the Europa League on Thursday that reached.</seg>
<seg id="4">"The sense of achievement was extremely important", confirmed Kapit√§n and goalkeeper, Steffen Hofmann, who climbed up to third place with Gr√ºn-Wei√ü.</seg>
<seg id="5">Schrammel's dream goal has led Rapid on the right way to the disappointment experienced against Helsinki, and they reach the end of the international season with a road to victory. Two winning seasons show that Rapid have reacted in the heightened morale.</seg>
<seg id="6">"We wanted to show a positive reaction", the defender Thomas Schrammel said, whose magnificent and skillful corner in the 14th minute set them on a winning course.</seg>
<seg id="7">"I thought I'd build up all of the frustration from Thursday, and smashed it into the top of the net", the 26-year old said smiling.</seg>
<seg id="8">That Schrammel 13th of November 2010 was, until now, the last time had scored in a team from the Bundesliga, and that was with Ried.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first championships goal at Rapid-Dress will, therefore, always be a special memory for him.</seg>
<seg id="10">"That is something quite special for me, I am Rapid offspring", Schrammel said.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to Mario Pavelic's recent, Schrammel moved from playing left back to right back, where he also serve did a very good job.</seg>
<seg id="12">He had enough experience to be able to the that he also position spiegelverkehrt aus√ºben can.</seg>
<seg id="13">He deserved the goal has already achieved some assists this year ", Barisic stated.</seg>
<seg id="14">The team shows character. Schrammel also crossed the ball over 2: 0 bright lights during the wide range of Hofmann after the first hour, which led to the decisive to the decision.</seg>
<seg id="15">But before that, even the fans could have kept the score.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Thank God we had some luck today", Schrammel noted, alluding to the gap between the efforts made and results achieved in the past weeks: "The results were not justified, but the games were always better when compared to last year".</seg>
<seg id="17">Barisic even decided that "in other games better than before today", and against "the strongest team to play in the stadium this season this had played,".</seg>
<seg id="18">These are the first three points since 26th July, and therefore prove that the structure of the team is intact despite the setbacks: "Today, my team has shown that they have character".</seg>
<seg id="19">For him, what is just as pleasing is: "The fact that we finally played to a clean sheet again,".</seg>
<seg id="20">A lot of work was done during the internal football break. The, as well as the fact that of Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger unfortunate circumstances that led to the absence and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl, is what makes this success all the more valuable.</seg>
<seg id="21">"We must not forget that", Barisic said, who has lost players in the last three days, including Behrendt and Pavelic, "who recently were very stable".</seg>
<seg id="22">The international football break therefore has to be used "to lick wounds and to improve physically a bit", Barisic explained, who has five under 21s in his ranks.</seg>
<seg id="23">One, the break came in particularly useful one of whom, captain Hofmann.</seg>
<seg id="24">He bends over backwards for the team, ignoring any pain.</seg>
<seg id="25">Especially during these difficult times, he showed that he is a very important player for us ", Barisic stated.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before being substituted in the 68th minute, Hofmann not only gave structure to Rapid's game, but also scored the second goal.</seg>
<seg id="27">For the 33-year old, who Bundesliga-Spiel. Absolvierte, it was his first of the Treffer from game in his first goal since November 2, 2013 (4: 2 against Admira).</seg>
<seg id="28">Hofmann: "We must not think that all is now well". "I am sure we had a bit of luck on our side, but, at some point, that luck had to come back to us.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was high time ", Hofmann said.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of course, he spoke about focused and continued work: "You don't have to always see things black and white.</seg>
<seg id="31">We haven in recent weeks't been playing as badly, such as it has been made out to be.</seg>
<seg id="32">However, we mustn't think that all is now well.</seg>
<seg id="33">His importance to the team is something that he could not deny.</seg>
<seg id="34">After all, it is a very young team, which, I am able to help at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="35">They hold on to me in certain phases ", Hofmann said.</seg>
<seg id="36">Gr√∂dig's coach, Michael Baur and his team have little to blame themselves for.</seg>
<seg id="37">He is sorry about the quick counter goal, describing it as "a kind of magic goal", as well as the normal goal scored by Nutz in the 40th minute, which was wrongfully denied by the referee, Kollegger.</seg>
<seg id="38">The only criticism I can make about the team is that we were sometimes not precise enough upfield.</seg>
<seg id="39">Because we had far to few goals.</seg>
<seg id="40">Center back, Maximilian Karner thought the same: "It started off badly, but we then found our feet, and even scored a goal.</seg>
<seg id="41">All in all, we could have had more.</seg>

<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded cease battling on Sunday that the Ukrainian government against the separatists in the country's east and immediately begin negotiations on "statehood," according to the breakaway region aufnimmt.</seg>
<seg id="3">His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin didn't mean to the under separatist control of the separatists stehende territory in the eastern part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine had to be revised to give the Russian-speaking region the power to protect its rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">But Putin's call upon the Kiev government to negotiate with the pro-Russia insurgents as equals with the apparent strategy he has since the violence began five months ago he has followed since: Help the separatists take territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region virtual independence for a Allianz with Russia instead of the erm√∂glichen to Westen.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with state-run Channel One television, Putin denounced the Ukrainian military campaign to recover separatist-held territory in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions that were seized in March and April, after Moscow annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula on March 18.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists have lately branded the seized territory "Novorossiya," or "New Russia," a term that harkens to pre-revolutionary glory days of the Russian empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin said that anyone who believed in the offing as Ukrainian politicians launch campaigns for an Oct. 26 parliamentary election and while government troops are attacking civilian communities in separatist-held regions is on peace talks are in her "Illusionen," Itar-Tass reported.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We must immediately commence substantive talks and not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the statehood status of southeast Ukraine in order to serve the interests of people living there," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskov said Putin's reference to statehood was meant in the context of the broader autonomy that discussed for months with the Kiev leadership has been is due to in the Russian-speaking areas zerstreuen to that their cultural and linguistic rights are in danger.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's not a matter to be negotiated between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it was not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Kremlin spokesman's intercession to correct the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underscored the Russian leadership's approach to dealing with the separatist rebellion in the direkten Annektion of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million population is ethnic Russian.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would have a much the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine more difficult fight to annex even, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian and pre-conflict polls showed broad support for staying within Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">The autonomy that Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums would grant regional governments in Ukraine the authority to determine their own trade agreements and foreign relations to, effectively handing the Kremlin de facto control over territory that would link the Russian mainland with Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Black Sea peninsula annexed five months ago is home to Russia's main naval fleet as well as commercial maritime facilities and historic coastal resorts.</seg>
<seg id="16">The regions between Russia's Rostov area and Crimea are also home to mines, factories and foundries that produce vital components for the Russian military.</seg>
<seg id="17">The Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inauguration speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers - after new elections -- weigh constitutional amendments to give more control to the disparate regions over their finances and the status of languages.</seg>
<seg id="18">But his vision of autonomy appears to differ sharply from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels Moscow is accused of arming and instigating.</seg>

<seg id="23">"We are of close to the point," Poroshenko warned.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.</seg>

<seg id="2">The way a hard grind was Tortur for some, while others treated it as a light training session.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, everyone agreed on one thing: It was a lot of fun.</seg>
<seg id="4">Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.</seg>
<seg id="5">For the very first time in his life the head of the Oberursel Brewery took his bike up the Feldberg.</seg>
<seg id="6">And for a good cause.</seg>
<seg id="7">The on Muskelkater as he is an easy wegstecken, participation in the 8th Cycling Event on the Grosser Felberg was in aid of the 'Help for children with cancer' association, and gave him a valuable personal insight.</seg>
<seg id="8">A great thing.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I now know that I can do it - brilliant!"</seg>
<seg id="10">A little break to milk the applause?</seg>
<seg id="11">No, if I'd stopped, I'd never have been able to carry on...</seg>
<seg id="12">Like Thomas Studanski, a for the CDU in the Oberursel town council, many a member of the 718 participants struggled in the early mountain dew, coming close to exhaustion, but arriving happily on top of the summit plateau.</seg>
<seg id="13">On the other hand, some others found it much easier to complete the full eleven kilometre route between Hohemark and Feldberg.</seg>
<seg id="14">Norman Diessner, for example.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Green Politician, wearing all red, from the municipal council - red clothes, red bike - looked almost like a to be taking it gently ("Quit some professionals here, so it's all the about finishing!") - proved himself to beam out bright lights during the wide but then Berg halber as a Profi and 45 minutes later without pausing for breath.</seg>
<seg id="16">Did come along and try out one who a go, as did Nina Kuhn, press spokesperson for the Oberursel Council, who have clashed with security security services, armed with Frank Gr√ºneisen on the Weg at an overthrow.</seg>
<seg id="17">For both the triathletes the "Feldberg Cycling Event" was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This one is about charity, and that's why we're glad to be here - we'd have gone out riding anyway today," Kuhn said.</seg>
<seg id="18">Along the route they met up with Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.</seg>
<seg id="19">The boy (12) had driven down to back in to go back up to Oberusel.</seg>
<seg id="20">Florian Zierz from Frankfurt got himself into the saddle at 9 am; he "did" the Feldberg twice, before then wheeling back home.</seg>

<seg id="23">He had been sitting holding hands with his 6,5-Kilo-Rennrad angepeilt 40 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="24">A mad event.</seg>
<seg id="25">For this cause I'm very glad to be here, "commented Andreas Balzke.</seg>
<seg id="26">The well-conditioned man from Mainz said he was an "ambitious racing cyclist."</seg>
<seg id="27">And he must be, since he was riding a "Fixie-Bike" which is a bike without gears...</seg>
<seg id="28">But it wasn't only cyclists who jaunted to the top - as was evidenced not only by the 20 walkers, who climbed up via the White Wall and the Fuchstanz, but also by a jogger who pulled behind him a tyre with weights attached to him by a rope.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mountain Rescue doctor, Professor Volker Lischke, who was there with his team was equipped with a four-wheel Bully and Quad to provide safety, and drew, said: "I know him from Frankfurt, he trains for a specialist sleigh trail - it's just that he pulls the sleigh himself." The man is, therefore, in a sense his own sleigh dog.</seg>
