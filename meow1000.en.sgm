<seg id="1">Recalling the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights</seg>
<seg id="2">Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have offered the bill, on which organization is protected by unions as a civil right.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Where unions and middle-class jobs," says Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, who is co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive factions.</seg>
<seg id="4">That is why I am proud to represent Act expanding workers ’ rights, together with the symbol of the movement for civil rights by John Lewis.</seg>
<seg id="5">This bill will give workers the same legal opportunities for trade union organization, that discrimination and other forms of discrimination, opponents of trade union power</seg>
<seg id="6">Changing the Act regulating labour relations in such a way as to allow the workers encountering discrimination for participation in trade union organizations, to seek justice in the civil courts - and to receive compensation for damages and punitive payments - a sensible and necessary initiative.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, this is certainly not a radical initiative - at least by American standards.</seg>
<seg id="8">In fact, the best way to understand that offer Ellison, Lewis and co-authors of the bill, "recall is a very American idea.</seg>
<seg id="9">Despite the attacks, which the unions have in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country, Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt, to expand and to respect human rights.</seg>
<seg id="10">There was a time, which is still remembered by millions of Americans, when this country simultaneously defend democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.</seg>
<seg id="11">When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, General Douglas MacArthur and his assistants have helped the country to adopt a constitution, so as to ensure that the paramilitary autocracy Хидеки Тодзё was replaced by democracy.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included text that explicitly admitted that "the right of workers to organize and to negotiate, and for collective action is guaranteed."</seg>
<seg id="13">When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Эйзенхауер and his assistants have helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that fascism Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.</seg>
<seg id="14">Recognizing that workers will need to be organized and be heard in the new state, Germans have included an article that openly stated: "The right to form associations with the aim to protect and improve employment and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity.</seg>
<seg id="15">Agreements that restrict or seek to diminish that right, will have no legal force; measures aimed at these targets will be deemed illegal.</seg>
<seg id="16">When former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was president of the International Commission on Human Rights, which was World Declaration of Human Rights, which in 1948, will be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the guarantee included the fact that "everyone has the right to organize and join unions to protect their interests."</seg>
<seg id="17">Generations of Americans take for granted our basic position that labor rights are human rights.</seg>
<seg id="18">When this country was advised by other countries about how to create a civil and democratic society, Americans have explained that the right to organize labor unions - and the fact that this union has participated as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - should be protected.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now, when these rights are under assault in America, wisely, indeed, return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize, and to ensure that their voices were heard in a free and open society.</seg>
<seg id="20">As the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:</seg>
<seg id="21">History is a great teacher.</seg>
<seg id="22">Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has undermined the strength of the nation, but increased them.</seg>
<seg id="23">Raising the living standards of millions, unions miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to fragile level of production.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who attack on unions, forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.</seg>
<seg id="25">History remembers should and to us.</seg>
<seg id="26">Formal recognition of labour rights as human rights and the protection of civil rights, to prevent discrimination against organizations, trade unions, was long overdue.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the U.S., a federal judge on Sunday temporarily has blocked the enactment of a law in Louisiana, which his supporters say he likely closes all five абортных clinics in the state.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to this measure, which was signed by Governor of Louisiana Bobby Джинадлом in June and was supposed to go into effect September 1, doctors who do abortions, were obliged to have powers of patients in a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.</seg>
<seg id="4">Nevertheless, the judge's decision means that, at the moment, doctors can continue to do legal abortions, while continuing to seek such powers.</seg>
<seg id="5">"Complainants will be allowed to work legally, continuing actions to gain power," he wrote in his decision, Judge John деГрэвеллз.</seg>
<seg id="6">A hearing will be scheduled within a month, at which the judge bear a more permanent solution on this law.</seg>
<seg id="7">Advocates for abortion rights welcomed this decision, with the latter in the length of rulings against similar measures, saying it will give doctors more time to obtain hospital authority.</seg>
<seg id="8">"Today's decision ensures that the women will be protected from the insidious Louisiana law, which seeks to deprive them of the health and human rights," said Nancy Нортап, president and head of the Center for reproductive Rights, which filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the five clinics.</seg>
<seg id="9">It was not immediately clear whether the decision to doctors from two clinics, which are not played claimants in the case, and also filed a request for authority.</seg>
<seg id="10">Louisiana is one of 11 states that have adopted similar laws, and the courts recently acknowledged such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="11">Техасского key parts of the law, which would have shut most of the remaining clinics in this state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fighters for the right to abortion, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association say the law on the powers to impose enrollment restrictions, doctors are not necessary from the medical point of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Abortion opponents object that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, though some also noted their positive effect in the closing clinics.</seg>
<seg id="14">Only one doctor who does abortions in Louisiana, there are powers of the reception in the hospital, according to the Center for reproductive Rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">If all the other doctors in the state will be forced to cease to perform this procedure, the physician, fearing for their safety, could no longer perform this procedure, the group reported.</seg>
<seg id="16">Criticizing the decision, officials in Louisiana said that will not punish doctors doing abortions as long as their statements on the reception awaiting decisions.</seg>

<seg id="1">What will the introduction of quotas for domestic products</seg>
<seg id="2">No less than half of products for each type of product in the range trading networks should be the Russian production, says Duma deputy from Just Russia, Oleg Nilov has informed.</seg>
<seg id="3">The MP has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures in respect of domestic manufacturers, writes the newspaper Izvestia.</seg>
<seg id="4">The document will still детализироваться to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.</seg>
<seg id="5">This relates to goods which are not manufactured in Russia. <... > According to the rest of the groups of products, which are manufactured in Russia, will have to provide is: Less than half of their shelves domestic manufacturers, "said Niklas Nilov has informed.</seg>
<seg id="6">Together with the amendments, in the article "On the basis of state regulation of trading activities in the Russian Federation," the bill provides for the introduction of changes to the Tax Code, laying down a total of 10% rate of VAT on the sale of products produced in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The idea to introduce a 50% quota in -процентную trade networks included in the stimulus package for Russian producers.</seg>
<seg id="8">On the shelves there will be several times more than domestic goods.</seg>
<seg id="9">However, this initiative can have both a positive and negative effect, experts say.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to attorney Налоговик ", a member of the independent think-tank" Public Duma Sergei Litvinenko for the Russian economy, as well as for domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive in nature, and will lead to growth.</seg>
<seg id="11">The advantage will be key, farmers, and small shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">They will be able to sell more, and that means that profits will grow.</seg>
<seg id="13">In addition, they will have the right to dictate their terms and prices, retailers because they will be forced to buy their goods.</seg>
<seg id="14">Russian manufacturers will be able to increase their business and sales, which would pay higher taxes than before.</seg>
<seg id="15">It will increase revenue, create new jobs, industries will grow any faster осваиваться, will be introduced to contribute to the growth of GDP.</seg>
<seg id="16">Russia's dependence on foreign food down several times, though not immediately, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="17">Earlier, Russian companies are often unable to break into the shelves of local stores due to higher competition from foreign rivals.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now, after the introduction of the embargo, this niche liberated and sigh of relief.</seg>
<seg id="19">But do not forget that, after all the necessary approvals and sanitary inspections to the Russian market demand food products from the countries of Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.</seg>
<seg id="20">In other words, it is now "a moment of calm, when the players have already left, and new ones yet to come.</seg>
<seg id="21">Almost a month later, we can say the demand for Russian raw materials, as well as rising prices for finished products, "said Vice President of АиФ.ru first all-Russian social organization" Russian club finance directors, "Tamara Kasyanov.</seg>
<seg id="22">Clearly, the idea of selling in each category at least 50% of the Russian food products will consolidate the sector for local producers.</seg>
<seg id="23">In that case, they will compete with each other, and not with goods that subsidy at the expense of another state, are cheaper.</seg>
<seg id="24">In other words, the struggle for the buyer will unfold between the companies working on one of the industry.</seg>
<seg id="25">On the other hand, says Kasyanov, Russian producers can meet 50% of domestic needs compatriots far in all directions.</seg>
<seg id="26">And in this situation commercial networks would have to "share" дотягивать Russian goods up to half of the range.</seg>
<seg id="27">In this regard, increasing fears that some products were on the shelves.</seg>
<seg id="28">Perhaps under the guise of manufactured in Russia, will be delivered to foreign products with перебитыми labels, "adds an expert.</seg>
<seg id="29">The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will feel large trading networks, especially those which выгодней cooperate with importers.</seg>
<seg id="30">It is logical that the prime minister will suffer and foreign suppliers, because the demand for their products drop.</seg>
<seg id="31">Litvinenko did not rule out that the law on quotas on domestic goods may impact on consumers.</seg>
<seg id="32">The fact is that some of the Russian-made products can yield quality imported ones, while shops will be boosting prices on the second as a scarce commodity.</seg>
<seg id="33">The single idea in the early 2000s import economists started talking again in February this year because of the ongoing devaluation of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="34">Now, against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the question of refusal to the import of products becomes even more urgent.</seg>
<seg id="35">The law is designed to oblige suppliers to retailers under orders from domestic producers.</seg>
<seg id="36">Then we are much faster and more confident strolling along the path of import substitution and the planning system of production on necessary types of products will be created in a shorter period of time, "says MP Oleg Nilov has informed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Especially effective mechanism will introduce quotas for those agricultural sectors, where the potential is especially high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.</seg>
<seg id="38">Our farmers are able to fully cover the shelves in Russian shops.</seg>
<seg id="39">In addition, a powerful impetus may get meat and dairy production.</seg>
<seg id="40">As you know, the biggest share of imports remains on offer - from 30% to 35%.</seg>

<seg id="2">Whether Russians feel a sharp rise in prices</seg>
<seg id="3">The Russian proposal as a result of the sanctions and the inflation accelerates in Russia and not in forecasts уложится authorities, analysts believe, "VTB Capital."</seg>
<seg id="4">According to experts, the deferred effects антисанкций will lead to inflationary ever in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.</seg>
<seg id="5">According to the latest forecast, in 2014, inflation will be 6,5-7,5 percent next year and to less than 6.5 percent.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, according to the newspaper, "Kommersant," the commentary this week should make "small but significant" changes in macroeconomic forecast up to 2017.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the publication, the Office may lower estimate of inflation in 2015, which will eliminate progeSOFT expected personal income growth.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the forecast, it was assumed that the food sanctions apply a year - until August 2015.</seg>
<seg id="9">In such a situation, you could assume such high inflation?</seg>
<seg id="10">The current situation is a shock, but during понижательный trend of inflation does not change, "said the source of the newspapers in the end.</seg>
<seg id="11">Economists from VTB Capital does not share the economic bloc's expectations regarding inflation and predict price growth in 2014 at the level of 8%.</seg>
<seg id="12">The main effect of product bans will come together with the possible introduction in the regions of the Russian Federation sales tax (GAP) in 2015, experts believe.</seg>
<seg id="13">Inflation would peak at 9 per cent in February, after which the annual pace of price growth will decline, experts believe.</seg>
<seg id="14">Incidentally, last week, Rosstat summed the first inflation results, after Russia introduced "neat sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="15">АиФ.ru interviewed experts and found their inflationary expectations.</seg>
<seg id="16">Artem Деев, head of research at FC AForex:</seg>
<seg id="17">Prices have already observed in key segments.</seg>
<seg id="18">Moreover, when I began to appreciate the socially relevant products, the government was forced to launch measures of monitoring systemic risks to price stability, in order to prevent unreasonable price increases in the short term.</seg>
<seg id="19">Suppliers and retailers already report on a daily basis before regulators that the authorities knew exactly who was where and for what reason will trigger an increase in prices.</seg>
<seg id="20">The key consumer price index growth continues to be tremendous pace of capital flight, excessive refinancing the banking sector from the Russian мегарегулятора, internal convert because of the flight of foreign currency, as well as an embargo on the import of food products from the countries that joined the sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="21">If inflationary pressures remained under control, the cost of a minimum basket of food has not jumped to 12 per cent in just one quarter.</seg>
<seg id="22">A ban on the importation of food products provoked shock proposals on the internal market and led to the utterly логичному increase the final cost.</seg>
<seg id="23">Because at this stage we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, as well as increase self-sufficiency of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production, retaliatory sanctions continue to bear the risks of inflationary growth component.</seg>
<seg id="24">If you include another and fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as ухудшенными prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year, inflation could exceed 8%.</seg>
<seg id="25">Alexander Разуваев, director of the analytical department Альпари. ""</seg>
<seg id="26">In the 1990s, inflation sometimes hit 20-30% per month to zero, it was also higher than current levels, another thing that then it is offset by rapid economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="27">I think, at the end of the year inflation will be 8-8,5%.</seg>
<seg id="28">Plato Магута, managing assets of the Criminal Code, "the Fund Магута"</seg>
<seg id="29">An external factor associated with sanctions against Russia, while successfully contained, but if there is a further increase of the pressure, first and foremost, for the financial sector - this can lead to certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations, which usually manifest themselves in traditionally purchases cash currency in order to protect their savings.</seg>
<seg id="30">It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance will try to smooth the weakening rouble, as market practices and government regulation.</seg>
<seg id="31">But prices traditionally begins after a lull over the summer and, possibly, this fall will become more pronounced.</seg>

<seg id="15">"As regards the proposed settlements for the constructive elements, but in practice this is implementable, because the building has often used different technologies," he said.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is no secret that стройрынок develops thanks largely to госзаказу.</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the Chairman of the Management Board of the NP "Экспертное procurement professionals" Catherine Лезиной community, today the state is the most effective customer.</seg>
<seg id="18">The deputy director of the pharmaceutical industry for Rosatom capital construction Vladimir Malakhov drew attention to the fact that today's market is nominally divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts, and the company that owns outsourced competence and does not allow for this field of competitors.</seg>
<seg id="19">He believes that the creation of a transparent market is only possible when access to contracts that Turkey will make to someone's impact.</seg>
<seg id="20">The expert council was asked to form a government in such a way that one and the same performer may not receive more than one contract worth more than 1 billion rubles, or multiple contracts totaling more than $1 billion.</seg>
<seg id="21">In минстрое believe that this approach must be evaluated from the point of view of the business impact, and effectiveness of construction management.</seg>
<seg id="22">As explained by Elena Zhukova, in this case, you will need to endow customer functions, which will lead to an increase in the number of customer and budgetary expenditure on its content.</seg>
<seg id="23">While the customer will need to have the knowledge to assess the quality of work performed подрядными organizations, as well as their safety.</seg>
<seg id="24">Often with such by, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the security of an object in general.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition, this approach may result in the outflow of highly skilled participants in connection with the state in obtaining state indeed on part-time work and a small amount of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="26">Deputy head Alexander Евсташенков procurement экспертно-консультационного Center Institute, believes that the government has now turned into a business to Scor contractor.</seg>
<seg id="27">And this example: "A participant while completing application must specify" specific performance "without specifying the words" or equivalent "," should "," "," "more," "less than," "similar" "or", "type", "a similar type," "lower," "lower," "higher," "can," "may," "might," "earlier" and "no earlier", not "higher," "not allowed" and so on.</seg>
<seg id="28">Thus, customers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of applications supplied подрядными organizations.</seg>
<seg id="29">Another problem, according to Евсташенкова 44-ФЗ became necessary to assess the application quality of work through the "paper" proposal.</seg>
<seg id="30">An application by a participant, really can be assessed only qualified contractors, but not the quality of the work, the implementation of which has not yet even began, "said the expert.</seg>
<seg id="31">The quality of the works can be assessed only on their acceptance.</seg>
<seg id="32">The expert council also was asked to take a margin income from the upper to the lower train had disappeared to intermediate contractors.</seg>
<seg id="33">Chairman of the expert committee, espionage, FAS Andrew Цариковский believes that it should not, as responsible for the order should генподрядчик.</seg>
<seg id="34">But otherwise, as in the famous репризе of Arkady Raikin normalises sleeping: "Пуговицам claims to have?"</seg>

<seg id="1">As people live in an old house</seg>
<seg id="2">In the former home of gold and горнозаводчиков Евдокима Демидова Ivan and his son on the street of the October Revolution, 57 / 1 (former Big Kazan) 18 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="3">Since the 18th century buildings never changed, if not considered ветхость.</seg>
<seg id="4">People walk out here on tour, and residents are suffering more than delighted, from his privilege - the right to live in a house whose walls, Ufa старейшем remember leader Alexander Suvorov.</seg>
<seg id="5">The date of the house amongst others, historians point to the two dates - 1730 and 1737 years.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in any case, it turns out that the building of the nearly 300 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">The old yard, always open the door, the squeaky staircase.</seg>
<seg id="8">Doors in the apartments are located near each other, chair covers were cracked, and the walls are peeling plaster просветы places visible from the street.</seg>
<seg id="9">It seems everything rests on honest word.</seg>
<seg id="10">But local residents are told: "You don't think it is."</seg>
<seg id="11">Live in a wooden house dating from the 18th century, very difficult, "says Tatiana (1961, a resident of apartment # 3.</seg>
<seg id="12">The object is on госохране, but its content has not allocated the money for dozens of years, and we feel museum exhibits, about which the authorities simply forgot.</seg>
<seg id="13">The last renovation was 40 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="14">The walls of the great difficulties is performing well, but the foundation of the entire прогнил.</seg>
<seg id="15">Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, and Shell Extension once a week in a public bath.</seg>
<seg id="16">How can we be content in such conditions?</seg>
<seg id="17">The road passes directly under the windows, even a pedestrian zone.</seg>
<seg id="18">Tatiana dented curtain.</seg>
<seg id="19">Now see what before was only heard it: The windows of cars.</seg>
<seg id="20">You see, glass дребезжат constantly, can't open a window, and got used to the noise.</seg>
<seg id="21">As a man gets used to the good and the bad.</seg>
<seg id="22">Our apartment is still a top, thanks to her husband, hands in his gold.</seg>
<seg id="23">Moreover, we have two rooms, three of them live with her son.</seg>
<seg id="24">But for other families, the conditions are much worse on the second floor ceiling at a little more than one and a half metres tall.</seg>
<seg id="25">In contrast to Tatiana offers guests the roommate out of the apartment, No. 6 Lyudmila Старостиной.</seg>
<seg id="26">Nice friendly woman with threshold offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile said:</seg>
<seg id="27">We have a one-bedroom apartment, 14.5 m ² for four people, and we live with her husband and daughter with his granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="28">I'm here since birth, another boundary has never been seen before, "Lyudmila обводит eyes room: Sofa Measures for two of the letter" g "; one of them was the granddaughter with a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="29">Very closely and differs little from a domestic interior: Only the ceilings are pretty, "historical."</seg>
<seg id="30">But with the ceiling regularly flows: Tap system worn.</seg>
<seg id="31">Lyudmila said about his apartment at the same time, as the phone is private, the house which stands on the Roman ruins.</seg>
<seg id="32">Surely that is one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:</seg>
<seg id="33">Water spent about 40 years ago during the last repair.</seg>
<seg id="34">At the same time have made us a tiny kitchen and bathroom in закутке from former чулана.</seg>
<seg id="35">We live just there where квартировал Demidov family lived on the second floor of the servant.</seg>
<seg id="36">Our flat does not privatised, and why?</seg>
<seg id="37">In real estate loans, they say, privatization does not matter.</seg>
<seg id="38">I still get only apartment, can't apply for more.</seg>
<seg id="39">Already four months ago, we promised to provide, but promises it won't matter.</seg>
<seg id="40">Not used to complain and I will not.</seg>
<seg id="41">In this apartment (bedroom!) lived for an entire dynasty: My grandparents, mum and dad, I'm with my husband and my daughter with his granddaughter.</seg>
<seg id="42">Potential usurpers in this time.</seg>
<seg id="43">For example, здоровенные rats ran through the kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="44">Look at the walls of the outhouses, they one-meter wide thickness.</seg>
<seg id="45">They say the solution was involved in eggs, so long rests.</seg>
<seg id="46">A house built thoroughly Демидовым, thank you!</seg>
<seg id="47">Perhaps, but so far no one had killed with a crumbling battlement ceiling or сваей.</seg>
<seg id="48">Only construction still slowly dying in front of us: Boards and logs, floors are rotting house repeatedly failed, pouring cement, but it is futile - the solution goes into the ground, as well.</seg>
<seg id="49">They say, and is under our room the concealed лаз and move to the river White, who had once lived here, old Believers, so you can hide from danger, in which case.</seg>
<seg id="50">They also pursued.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lyudmila Stomatuk tells how it came some historian, pleaded to let that he started in the flat excavations.</seg>
<seg id="52">But then urged to give them housing space in exchange for its однушку prospectus in October.</seg>
<seg id="53">Lyudmila historian refused:</seg>
<seg id="54">Where are we in однушку вчетвером?</seg>
<seg id="55">And here at least a tiny hope is that will give housing more spacious.</seg>
<seg id="56">We agree on the exchange, would not have won.</seg>
<seg id="57">However, the family Старостиных anything and didn't win.</seg>
<seg id="58">The biggest dream of Lyudmila to Suburban Region, and daughter gave his granddaughter of one 16-year-old from a separate room.</seg>
<seg id="59">The two families have identified two-room apartment instead of the majestic ruins, in which two generations living now.</seg>
<seg id="60">The girl was pretty, Olesya Карсакова миниатюрная from No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.</seg>
<seg id="61">There in two cramped squeezed into airless apartments with a total area of 23 m ², called apartments, lives with her large family.</seg>
<seg id="62">We just seven people, two of them children.</seg>
<seg id="63">See for yourself what conditions.</seg>
<seg id="64">Your butt falls off pieces of plaster and window frames, the walls in the kitchen and in rooms cross-cutting holes.</seg>
<seg id="65">The water in the кране only cold all year round.</seg>
<seg id="66">Walking about the apartments of the old home, you can be sure that the most fortunate of spouses Лаврентьевым apartment No. 4.</seg>
<seg id="67">They occupy the most spacious rooms of the first floor.</seg>
<seg id="68">You're right, places a lot!</seg>
<seg id="69">The 75 square, directed three people.</seg>
<seg id="70">We live just like in those rooms, where legend has it stopped the police during his stay in Ufa, the head of the family, "said Aleksandr Dmitrievich Lavrentyev.</seg>
<seg id="71">High ceilings, spacious.</seg>
<seg id="72">One bad - all around the train wreck, falling apart, collapsing.</seg>
<seg id="73">Neighbors probably already told.</seg>
<seg id="74">The more suffering we have with the sexes: Wooden boards сгнили, literally walked out from under the feet of earth.</seg>
<seg id="75">I put подпорки, wedges, anything in the hall to another room, and as we walk, on a seesaw качаемся, so all was not cemented.</seg>
<seg id="76">The merchant's house Евдокима Демидова Aleksandr Dmitrievich can tell you better than any guide.</seg>
<seg id="77">The золотопромышленнику refers to the native, speaks of it with admiration.</seg>
<seg id="78">Indeed, the personality and the owner was fantastic: Кагинского Узянского plants built houses, отливал guns and bells, kept Romani mines.</seg>
<seg id="79">Merchants take pride in an ancestor estate heirs, but live under one roof with history no longer want.</seg>
<seg id="80">As a kid, I moved here in the 1940s, in the 20th century, "said Aleksandr Dmitrievich.</seg>
<seg id="81">Then, standing around a wooden building there, stables and sentry boxes guarding снесенные, subsequently.</seg>
<seg id="82">In 1968, wanted to remove, and our home, but something prevented.</seg>
<seg id="83">The same story was repeated again in 2014: Поманили new housing.</seg>
<seg id="84">We, as a team, gathered all the necessary court documents обегали, and suddenly learned that moving to an apartment in 2015 or 2016.</seg>
<seg id="85">Something already doesn't believe in all this.</seg>
<seg id="86">Two years ago, Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan, to learn the fate of their homes.</seg>
<seg id="87">Officials of the occupier was not accepted.</seg>
<seg id="88">Sent from one desk to another, but then, as mockery, given a piece of paper with signatures and stamps: "The Ministry of Culture does not argue against the resettlement of tenants."</seg>
<seg id="89">Even though I have a feeling that our house has long been not in terms of the city since he first was at number 57, then became 57 A, now 57 / 1.</seg>
<seg id="90">As if he had been demolished in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="91">"A planet" contacted the management of the sector, the head of Project Support Resources Ufa Vladimir Барабашу.</seg>
<seg id="92">A house on the street of the October Revolution, 57 / 1 is included in the programme for the resettlement of the old housing.</seg>
<seg id="93">I cannot answer for the actions of officials from the 1970s, only know that at the time there was a plan for the demolition of all old houses, despite its historical importance.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fortunately, this has not happened, and the decision of the authorities is to rebuild the old house on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value, "successfully.</seg>
<seg id="95">Tenants soon plans to provide for new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="96">According to Барабаша, restore House Демидова are Italian specialists who have participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="97">Now in Italy passes architectural Biennale, and the project "Old Ufa" presented there, among others.</seg>
<seg id="98">I hope that by 2016 all former Old Kazan Street will be best Western Hotel Tigra was renovated, "said the official.</seg>
<seg id="99">Purchase order, the home, which was earlier, three centuries ago.</seg>
<seg id="100">Демидова house, is likely to become a museum, open to all comers.</seg>
<seg id="101">In addition, the government decided to do on weekends, a pedestrian street.</seg>
<seg id="102">In everyday life, unfortunately, didn't get too much workload of roads in the city.</seg>
<seg id="103">People from the future to provide the museum's Vladimir Barabas promises in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="104">However, it is unlikely that they will be: Their new apartments will be of the same area, and that the current.</seg>
<seg id="105">Only from another era.</seg>

<seg id="1">Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.</seg>
<seg id="2">Never say, "I love you"</seg>
<seg id="3">Henry was one of seven children born to a family of immigrants from Jamaica in Dudley in is in 1958.</seg>
<seg id="4">His father, who died when Henry was 19, he worked in a factory, and their relationship has been limited.</seg>
<seg id="5">Henry репетирует comedy, "Редкие records Rudi," which is partially based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of programmes on Radio 4.</seg>
<seg id="6">The soundtrack is a mix of 914.9 and rap, and melodies - жизнерадостны.</seg>
<seg id="7">However, Henry had to get through some difficult memories of childhood.</seg>
<seg id="8">After the death of his mother was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often mused about the relationship with his father.</seg>
<seg id="9">He was very inaccessible.</seg>
<seg id="10">You never saw his face, you've only heard his voice: "Don't make noise.</seg>
<seg id="11">Отстань dated sisters.</seg>
<seg id="12">Шевелись!</seg>
<seg id="13">I want to watch the cricket.</seg>
<seg id="14">My older brothers, Seymour and Hilton, who were older, when I was a child, walked with him down the pub and talked about such things as a form of beer glasses, the beauty of the strike.</seg>
<seg id="15">I have never talked with him.</seg>
<seg id="16">He was so неулыбчивым guy in the corner who was reading the newspaper for most of my life.</seg>
<seg id="17">Henry opened the studio recently are in Dudley and, although conditions were better than in the days of his father, he was able to look at it, what must have been his life.</seg>
<seg id="18">Now there's a little bit better, but it's dark, дымные depth, extent of Hell with outbreaks of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot.</seg>
<seg id="19">My father залезал in a bathtub and just lay there, and you could hear, as he slowly begins to sing to myself, because he wanted to отмыться mould from the studio.</seg>
<seg id="20">When I came back, I realised that he was doing this for years and years, to earn money for food, and I began to appreciate it more.</seg>
<seg id="21">Nevertheless, Henry came from a childhood devoid of parental love.</seg>
<seg id="22">My father never hugged, never say, "I love you."</seg>
<seg id="23">It was only when her mother became ill at the end of her life, we started to talk: "I love you, I love you, I love you.</seg>
<seg id="24">The birth of her own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love that he lacked as a child.</seg>
<seg id="25">You can stop it, "I love you"?</seg>
<seg id="26">Just don't hug me!</seg>
<seg id="27">Dad, I'm 22!</seg>
<seg id="28">With Don French.</seg>
<seg id="29">Why would I not be friends with her?</seg>
<seg id="30">She's a great mother</seg>
<seg id="31">They are still great friends with the French, to whom he was married for 25 years.</seg>
<seg id="32">Don is a good man.</seg>
<seg id="33">Why don't I make friends with Don?</seg>
<seg id="34">She's a great mom.</seg>
<seg id="35">Henry was the mother of the diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="36">He was one of what killed her.</seg>
<seg id="37">So, when I was very, very recovered and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take radical measures.</seg>
<seg id="38">Then I began serious training фитенсом, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="39">It's very hard.</seg>
<seg id="40">And that's boring.</seg>
<seg id="41">Nobody eats carrots.</seg>
<seg id="42">A change of career trajectories of Henry reflected, perhaps, in his noble, briefly подстриженной beard.</seg>
<seg id="43">Since he received the recognition of the critics for his Othello, he completely immersed in theatre.</seg>
<seg id="44">"Комедия followed errors," and then "Заборы Огаста Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="45">This work is different from sitcoms and comedies that were неотъемлимым attribute his rich professional life.</seg>
<seg id="46">He began his career, when he was 16 and worked in a factory.</seg>
<seg id="47">DJ noticed how he parodies on the stage, and wrote about it in "The new faces."</seg>
<seg id="48">His career in television began in the mid seventies: "Quite a long time I was the only black пародистом / first on television."</seg>
<seg id="49">He studied at work.</seg>
<seg id="50">I not only had to grow up in front of the public, I had to learn how to be an effective vehicle for delivering jokes between 1975 and 1985, being a star, working in television, and it was very hard.</seg>
<seg id="51">Lenny in "New faces" in 1975</seg>
<seg id="52">As his manager had the rights to the show, "Black and white minstrels," light entertainment program, in which people "чернили themselves face," Henry found that acting in it for five years.</seg>
<seg id="53">My family is a very disliked.</seg>
<seg id="54">I was, like, hopefully, this never happened to me, but I don't regret that I did it.</seg>
<seg id="55">Although it was strange, worthy of condemnation position, I worked on large venues and learned to work the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="56">But what was the "which received awards of light entertainment on British television classics for years and years," was "grotesque, to black people."</seg>
<seg id="57">Introducing characters who were black culture in the UK, and her perfume, Henry worked door-to-door комедийном project in the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="58">The first season of "Show Lenny Henry" was broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as, among other things, the chef Гэрет Блэклок from the comedy series "Biased."</seg>
<seg id="59">Commercials, documentaries, television series and roles in films took the following ten years of his life, but, after his TV series on the BBC in 2008, "LennyHenry.tv," he thought, "what are you going to do next, Len, because it seems that you little time or тянешь сворачиваешь quietly to the side."</seg>
<seg id="60">Next was a series of documentary broadcasts on Radio 4 called "What the...?"</seg>
<seg id="61">The first was about figures (0-9).</seg>
<seg id="62">I had a true allergy to Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="63">That is not to say that I really have been taught this at school, and I thought that this is, in many ways, the prerogative of white middle-class people with колготками and cabbage at the bottom of the front.</seg>
<seg id="64">So I am very afraid of him.</seg>
<seg id="65">Everything, from whom we took the interview for transmission, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judy Денч said: "You need to try.</seg>
<seg id="66">Not ругай it, until you know what you are talking about.</seg>
<seg id="67">24 aloud some of those words, and you will understand why we still love Shakespeare.</seg>
<seg id="68">Henry read 20 rows last monologue from Othello for, and his зацепило.</seg>
<seg id="69">I have the feeling that I can do it.</seg>
<seg id="70">Like my head выправили.</seg>
<seg id="71">"That's what it is, this is a serious case, Treat seriously, uchi your text, make a small study.</seg>
<seg id="72">So, the process of rehearsal was tough, and I read this play for months and months before we got her.</seg>
<seg id="73">And she has had success.</seg>
<seg id="74">It seemed they had been waiting for disaster, but it didn't happen.</seg>
<seg id="75">Soon we began "Комедию mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="76">Suddenly I was at the National Theatre, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.</seg>
<seg id="77">There was one moment when I thought, "Oh, you have changed."</seg>
<seg id="78">The technical problem arose, and Henry instinctively felt that his case - to entertain the audience.</seg>
<seg id="79">"The Pacific voice inside me said: 'You have to work 10 minutes until they are computer operations."</seg>
<seg id="80">Instead, the assistant director, announced that view will resume as soon as the problem will be solved.</seg>
<seg id="81">I walked away from the scene and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."</seg>
<seg id="82">It's not my responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="83">I can let someone else deal with it.</seg>
<seg id="84">"You're playing in, stay in the role."</seg>
<seg id="85">Henry in "заборах Дачесс in theatre."</seg>
<seg id="86">Learn the "Заборов" was difficult.</seg>
<seg id="87">Panic is quite useful, she strengthens muscle.</seg>
<seg id="88">It was good, too, so it was like a sign over showing: "Here's what you need to do."</seg>
<seg id="89">He says that, of course, Громовым voice.</seg>
<seg id="90">So I держусь this.</seg>
<seg id="91">I really love it.</seg>
<seg id="92">I love being in the репетиционном hall.</seg>
<seg id="93">By the way, Henry still thinking comedian - all the way our conversation перебивают flashes his humor, when he starts something, he finishes to parody.</seg>
<seg id="94">I just decided not to work in стендапе, because this thing with instant gratification from a room full of strangers, I think is quite dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="95">If you want to do all the time, this can lead to a standstill.</seg>
<seg id="96">I sometimes work in "Прямом broadcast in Аполло", when I want, but, in the main, I don't get so much pleasure as before.</seg>
<seg id="97">I ask whether he would give стендапа tour ever.</seg>
<seg id="98">The joy of sitting in a room with the director, who helps shape the beginning, the middle and the end of the road - I don't think that will ever willingly withdraw from it.</seg>
<seg id="99">This is his new incarnation?</seg>
<seg id="100">I think so.</seg>
<seg id="101">I like to be an actor.</seg>
<seg id="102">It's pretty fun.</seg>
<seg id="103">You always tell a story, and here is a great place for this.</seg>
<seg id="104">I love history.</seg>

<seg id="4">And then she пожимала his hand.</seg>
<seg id="5">He saw in his irritability.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was колючим like hair, yes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The latest victim of this колючести was little novel, from which he waited longer than usual, deliverance from lonely and boring life, and perhaps even some sort of satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="8">Эйлинн Соломонз was as much a fragile beautiful with hair and трепещущим взлохмаченными heart of northern island villages, even more remote and harsh than Port Ройбен.</seg>
<seg id="9">She came to the south with older than myself, which I downloaded Кеверн believed her aunt, while the latter has inherited a house in crude, but like Paradise Valley under the name "joyous Райская Valley."</seg>
<seg id="10">No one lived in the house for several years.</seg>
<seg id="11">The pipes were trickling in defence were sitting motionless spiders, слизни left their footprints on all the windows, assured that the house belongs to them; garden зарос weeds, like giant кочаны cabbage.</seg>
<seg id="12">It was like a cottage from children ’ s books, simultaneously frightening and enchanting, with a garden full of secrets.</seg>
<seg id="13">Opinion of the author: Howard Джейкобсон, whose novel "J" is included in the лонг-лист Букеровской Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="14">The shortlist will be announced next week</seg>
<seg id="15">Кеверн Эйлинн and sat, holding hands, broken sun among the high grass, enjoying surprisingly warm spring day; they both absentmindedly to cheap metal console, which provided with country music and appeasing 3-zmianowy news, when, glancing at her brown crossed his legs, and he remembered the old song long forgotten black performer, which he liked to listen to his father, lowering his curtains in the house.</seg>
<seg id="16">You have too many legs.</seg>
<seg id="17">In view of the inherent aggressiveness, the type of songs to the console, no longer lost.</seg>
<seg id="18">They were not banned - nothing actually was not forbidden, just them no longer lost.</seg>
<seg id="19">They helped become архаичными, as the very word "archaic."</seg>
<seg id="20">Public taste did what would never have managed to obtain orders and injunctions, and as people choose among books of memoirs of the rich, staying in poverty, cookbooks and love the novels, of all the music they chose ballads.</seg>
<seg id="21">It happens this afternoon Кеверн began playing the piano and ideation gross comic voice praise great legs Эйлинн.</seg>
<seg id="22">Эйлинн not understood.</seg>
<seg id="23">"This was a popular song, a jazz pianist whose name was Фэтс Уоллер," he told her, mechanically placing two fingers to his lips.</seg>
<seg id="24">So did his father to stop the letter "J" before she слетит with his lips.</seg>
<seg id="25">It started with a game in which they played when he was little.</seg>
<seg id="26">His father played in it with his father, as he told him.</seg>
<seg id="27">Start with "J" word, forgetting to put two fingers to his mouth, "and it will cost you a penny.</seg>
<seg id="28">It was not very fun game then, and it was not very fun right now.</seg>
<seg id="29">He knew that people expect it from him, that's all.</seg>
<seg id="30">He had to explain what is jazz.</seg>
<seg id="31">Эйлинн never heard.</seg>
<seg id="32">Jazz is playing, even though he was not explicitly prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="33">Improvisation went out of fashion.</seg>
<seg id="34">Only one place left in life "if."</seg>
<seg id="35">When the music started, people wanted to know exactly where it will end.</seg>
<seg id="36">With wit in the same way.</seg>
<seg id="37">His unpredictability had acted on people's nerves.</seg>
<seg id="38">But jazz was wit, marked with the help of music.</seg>
<seg id="39">Though he has reached the age of 10 years, never слышав about Sammy Дэвисе Младшем Кеверн, knew about jazz from paternal полусекретной коллеции CDs.</seg>
<seg id="40">But at least he did not have to speak Эйлинн that Фэтс Уоллер was black.</seg>
<seg id="41">Given her age, it is unlikely that she remembered a time when popular singers were compelling.</seg>
<seg id="42">Again, there are no laws or pressure.</seg>
<seg id="43">Society was docile, and this meant that every segment of the agreed with gratitude - the gratitude of those spared the fate, "with the principle of group predispositions.</seg>
<seg id="44">People афро-карибского origin by temperament and physical characteristics are suitable for areas of entertainment and sport - and they sang and ran.</seg>

<seg id="48">Each according to his abilities.</seg>
<seg id="49">As she had heard only ballads Эйлинн was difficult to understand how offensive words, who had just sung her Кеверн, could be laid on music.</seg>
<seg id="50">The music is an expression of love.</seg>
<seg id="51">"They are not really offensive," said Кеверн.</seg>
<seg id="52">Except, maybe, for people who have great legs.</seg>
<seg id="53">My father never offended anybody, but he loved this song.</seg>
<seg id="54">He said too many, but launched a garden gave him the illusion of security.</seg>
<seg id="55">No word could not penetrate the soundproofing giant leaves similar to капустные.</seg>
<seg id="56">Эйлинн still did not understand.</seg>

<seg id="58">He wanted to say that this is a joke, but he never wanted it with two fingers to his lips again прижимать.</seg>

<seg id="63">Nothing, in that he wanted to watch.</seg>
<seg id="64">"Well, if you say so," she said, in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="65">But this still does not explain why you sing it to me.</seg>
<seg id="66">She seemed really upset.</seg>
<seg id="67">I have too big feet?</seg>
<seg id="68">He looked at them again.</seg>
<seg id="69">We cannot say no.</seg>

<seg id="71">And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?</seg>
<seg id="72">I hate you?</seg>
<seg id="73">Of course, I don't hate you.</seg>
<seg id="74">It's just this stupid song.</seg>

<seg id="77">I have such a perversion.</seg>
<seg id="78">It was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="79">He wanted it to be funny.</seg>
<seg id="80">Attempts joke frequently made him awkward situation, because, like his father, he was missing the soothing charm that could mitigate the cruelty крывшуюся derived.</seg>
<seg id="81">Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.</seg>
<seg id="82">Maybe he, Кеверн, wanted.</seg>
<seg id="83">Despite the good eye.</seg>
<seg id="84">Эйлинн Соломонз she blushed and stood up with the lounger, the console and the wine that they drank.</seg>
<seg id="85">Wine of intoxication from, so that he could not serve as an excuse.</seg>
<seg id="86">In his excitement, she seemed to have the lighter, as towards the leaves in the weather system.</seg>

<seg id="88">Though not like you very much.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was feeling sorry for her because of the excessive brutality of his words, and because of fear, who appeared in her eyes when she gave him.</seg>
<seg id="90">Whether she thought that he hit her?</seg>
<seg id="91">She has not talked to him about life in the cold of the northern archipelago, where she grew up, but he had no doubt that, in a fundamental sense, she was similar to здешнюю.</seg>
<seg id="92">The same huge icy ocean befell them both.</seg>
<seg id="93">American pilots could reflect the same with men, even more sensitive and capricious after IS THAT happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened than their ancestors, smugglers and разрушители, shopped in fury from pub to pub, ready to raise a hand on any woman, посмевшую поддразнить them or refuse them.</seg>
<seg id="94">Amounts to pointless head?</seg>
<seg id="95">They showed her a fist, if she wasn't careful.</seg>
<seg id="96">Would be first kissed, kiss now became the most common erotic expression of irritation between a man and a woman; an antidote from fresh ballads, which provide proper console - first to kiss her, and then hit.</seg>
<seg id="97">Excessive clarification, according to Кеверна because the kiss itself was already хулиганством.</seg>
<seg id="98">Эйлинн Соломонз corps showed that he needs to leave.</seg>
<seg id="99">He rose from the lounger, like an old man.</seg>
<seg id="100">She herself felt the lead weight, but the weight of his grief surprised her.</seg>
<seg id="101">This was not the end of the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">They barely knew each other.</seg>
<seg id="103">She looked, as he goes from an upper window and looked, as he was leaving, her companion, the man himself взваливший themselves.</seg>
<seg id="104">Adam, instead, a garden, she thought.</seg>
<seg id="105">She felt a stab of sympathy towards him and men in general, even though some of them and raised her hand.</seg>
<seg id="106">The man, from the pulpit, with отвернувшийся behind пристыженный ’, the ability to fight left him - why she felt she knew so well, if she could not recall a single case, until today, when she saw this?</seg>
<seg id="107">One Эйлинн Соломонз again looked at his feet.</seg>
<seg id="108">During the twenty years prior to the above events or so Эсме Нуссбаум, an intelligent and energetic 32-летняя исследовательница who worked in "Офнау", an informal service for monitoring Community mood, has prepared a report on the low and medium levels of violence in most parts of the country, where it was expected that it would, if not stop altogether, given the money and power, which have been allocated to its eradication.</seg>
<seg id="109">"A lot was done, and a lot is being done," she wrote, "to mitigate the innate aggressiveness of people who fought in a war and won most of them, especially among these спутанных branches and narrow расселин area, where, despite hovering over изгородями spires of churches, gentle breath of human kindness was rarely in history.</seg>
<seg id="110">However, some quality, it turns out, неискоренимы.</seg>
<seg id="111">The higher, it would seem, the низменнее those passions that he зарождает.</seg>
<seg id="112">People shed tears over the sentimental stories about drinking, skipping преодоленных obstacles and announces its overheated belief in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness retains its strong grip as in rural communities and in urban settlements, but there is evidence that the money is new, and a vile задиристость in homes, in the workplace, on roads and even in playgrounds.</seg>
<seg id="113">"You have payments habit of writing too much," said her supervisor, having read the report as a whole.</seg>
<seg id="114">I think you should read shorter novels.</seg>
<seg id="115">Эсме Нуссбаум head.</seg>
<seg id="116">I must also ask you: You атеистка?</seg>
<seg id="117">"I believe that is not obliged to answer," replied Эсме Нуссбаум.</seg>
<seg id="118">You lesbian?</seg>
<seg id="119">Эсме again insisted on his right to privacy and silence.</seg>
<seg id="120">A feminist?</seg>
<seg id="121">Again, silence.</seg>
<seg id="122">"I ask," said Luther Рабиновиц finally, "not because I am against atheism лесбийства or feminism.</seg>
<seg id="123">Here we have no prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="124">We are the servants of society without prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="125">But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely reasonable and a good in themselves, they may sometimes distort the results, such as those that you showed me.</seg>
<seg id="126">It is obvious that you yourself предубеждены against the church, and what you call the "malevolent" and "rude", others would be interpreted as an expression of natural healthy and intensity.</seg>
<seg id="127">The INJURY нудеть continue THAT happened, IF ВООБЩЕ happened, as if it had happened, if it happened yesterday, it means depriving the country needed her life force.</seg>
<seg id="128">Эсме Нуссбаум огляделась on both sides until Рабиновиц said.</seg>
<seg id="129">In his head, like a pink comfort, LED letters repeated advice that "Офнау" gave the country the last quarter of a century or more.</seg>
<seg id="130">His neighbour, улыбайся value of his spouse, listen to organise the ballads, walk, talk on the phone, listen, communicate, объясняй соглашайся, извиняйся.</seg>
<seg id="131">The conversation is better than silence, word of the song better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I fully understand that you want to say," quietly replied Эсме Нуссбаум, when satisfied that her supervisor had finished speaking, "and I don't want to say nothing, except that it was not as effective as we convince ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">I am worried about that unless we are ready, we will find that repeat mistakes that initially led to ТОМУ ВООБЩЕ IF THAT happened, happened.</seg>
<seg id="134">Only this time, throwing their anger and distrust, not on the other.</seg>
<seg id="135">Luther Рабиновиц joined finger-tips in the sitting.</seg>
<seg id="136">That gesture was supposed to mean the infinite patience.</seg>
<seg id="137">"You go too far," he said, "calling" mistakes "actions that have committed or not committed our grandfathers.</seg>
<seg id="138">You go too far and when talking about what they threw away their "anger" and "mistrust" to "other."</seg>
<seg id="139">In your place, people should not need to understand that, in the past, that is defending the present, we are not talking about "us" and "them."</seg>
<seg id="140">There was no "us" and there was no "other."</seg>
<seg id="141">It was a time of turmoil - that's about all we know.</seg>
<seg id="142">"For that, to be honest with ourselves," dared to insert Эсме, "neither part of society may well justify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="143">I am not accusing anyone.</seg>
<seg id="144">Whether it was good or bad, what is done is done.</seg>
<seg id="145">Then it was back then.</seg>
<seg id="146">You don't need to say anything more - and here we agree.</seg>
<seg id="147">And how not to blame anybody, we should not make excuses and, if that was appropriate, or if it was something you can fix.</seg>
<seg id="148">But why past, if not in order to learn "</seg>
<seg id="149">New past to be forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="150">If I can add to that one word -</seg>
<seg id="151">Luther Рабиновица pyramid collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="152">"I'll discuss your report," he said, and dismissed her.</seg>
<seg id="153">The next day, on the way to work, her knocked мотоциклист, who rode on the sidewalk, passersby, described as "a vicious rage."</seg>
<seg id="154">Coincidences happen.</seg>

<seg id="2">Production growth in the eurozone slowed to the lowest level in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.</seg>
<seg id="3">The business index (PMI) for the eurozone manufacturing sector fell to mark public 50.7 in August, dropping from 51.8 in July.</seg>
<seg id="4">The value of above 50 indicates growth.</seg>

<seg id="6">The values were received before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Markets will wait for the bank from a clear plan of how to cope with stopping the eurozone ’ s recovery, as well as with the threat of deflation, with inflation of just 0.3 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="8">There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi later this week may give further signals that he is contemplating a scheme of quantitative easing in the eurozone, similar to those that have used the United Kingdom and the United States during the financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Although some growth is better than no growth, and the braking effect of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on producers are becoming more obvious," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at public.</seg>
<seg id="10">Germany's PMI manufacturing sector, a major trade partner of Russia in the EU, has fallen to the lowest levels for 11 months of 51.4.</seg>
<seg id="11">In the meantime, the bloc's second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to an additional 46.9.</seg>

<seg id="16">Howard Арчер, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say about August survey index of business activity in the manufacturing sector in the eurozone, it is that it shows that the sector is still growing."</seg>
<seg id="17">He added: "Obviously, eurozone manufacturers will find life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension - particularly associated with Russia / Ukraine, adds uncertainty still difficult conditions in many countries.</seg>
<seg id="18">This increasing tension, apparently hit by business - and especially on the confidence of consumers, and is likely to lead to the fact that some orders delayed, or even cancelled, especially large orders.</seg>

<seg id="55">We never say that they killed or dead.</seg>
<seg id="56">We say that they stayed in the gym.</seg>

<seg id="58">But now he is afraid for such places as Ukraine, where war causes such grief, which survived, he and his friends.</seg>

<seg id="63">His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children, have been killed in this quarter, could you imagine?</seg>
<seg id="64">I remember the silence immediately after their capture, there are simply no children who would have screamed and ran around and this silence lasted for many months.</seg>
<seg id="65">She vividly remembers his trip with Дамиром in London.</seg>
<seg id="66">People in London cried when I told our story.</seg>
<seg id="67">I realized then, as people on the other end of the earth can understand our feelings, can provide support.</seg>
<seg id="68">She was grateful, "Sheri Blair and its fund for the award and the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004.</seg>
<seg id="69">I would like to call Sheri and simply to herself to say that 10 years have passed, but I still remember a meeting with her and her husband in London and how they helped Дамиру and me.</seg>
<seg id="70">I remember when Damir wanted to eat, they rang up all the local Russian restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="71">I remember how he played with Scherer in the restaurant, Damir shot at them from a water pistol, and they flee and played with him.</seg>
<seg id="72">And only one month has passed since then our nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="73">I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our grief and to support us.</seg>
<seg id="74">She said: "I still think that this world was no better over these 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="75">Today in Ukraine a war, people are dying every day, and I think many children have been killed or be killed.</seg>
<seg id="76">It's just the same as our children.</seg>
<seg id="77">I think for many people, war is a news broadcast, that they listen to when they get bored or when they are busy with something else.</seg>
<seg id="78">I just know that these people feel, the horror of it.</seg>
<seg id="79">And I can't stop feeling it.</seg>
<seg id="80">Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.</seg>
<seg id="81">Damir grew up and became very soft and quiet as a boy, he's not an aggressive and angry.</seg>
<seg id="82">He is not looking for revenge, for example, he did not just fixed on it in this last nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="83">I know that he does not like to remember it, but they are very close with six classmates, and they go to the gym from time to time and burn candles there.</seg>
<seg id="84">When he was younger, he suffered from it - I remember he was lying on the couch, facing away from us, for hours.</seg>
<seg id="85">Did not sleep, his eyes were open.</seg>
<seg id="86">I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys. Дамиру now 17, he is taller than me, likeable, smart and healthy.</seg>
<seg id="87">To me it is hard to believe that a few hours I was so sure that he is dead and that I never see more.</seg>
<seg id="88">When I was able to recover from the explosion and rose to his feet, I огляделась hell, I saw around me, when parts of bodies were lying everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="89">I was absolutely convinced that it is not impossible that my little boy was able survive in this hell.</seg>
<seg id="90">"I remember what I shouted to him:" Убегай Damir, Run, "but again I was so sure he had heard me.</seg>
<seg id="91">But he heard, and ran off.</seg>
<seg id="92">So life goes on for us, unlike so many others.</seg>

<seg id="101">Only my Georgi managed to survive.</seg>
<seg id="102">The closer the date, the harder to think and talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="103">There is not a single day when we won't remember this tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="104">We don't think that it was a long time ago, I think it was yesterday, some scenes these days all the time, right before my eyes.</seg>
<seg id="105">Never forget, I promise you.</seg>
<seg id="106">Photograph: George западает in soul (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was увековечена into sculpture (right)</seg>

<seg id="112">George says now: "It is important that this never happened.</seg>
<seg id="113">"I doubt we will ever learn the truth.</seg>
<seg id="114">People continue to investigate this tragedy and will never know the truth.</seg>
<seg id="115">Now they investigate this collapse at Boeing in Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="116">Will we ever know what it was called?</seg>
<seg id="117">This world is going to something very bad.</seg>
<seg id="118">"I can't understand how it happens, because if you ask people, and nobody wants a war, because it is happening?</seg>
<seg id="119">Ten years is nothing for this pain.</seg>
<seg id="120">We need to have dozens of years slightly to forget her.</seg>
<seg id="121">It has affected my health, and I still feel it.</seg>
<seg id="122">About three or four years of nightmares because of me, but now it became better.</seg>
<seg id="123">I returned to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.</seg>
<seg id="124">I thought about his friends and classmates he lost that were killed.</seg>

<seg id="1">4 tips, how to achieve a better quality of underwater photos and videos</seg>
<seg id="2">If you want to take pictures or shoot video under water in front of you a whole range of options.</seg>
<seg id="3">The cheapest option is a waterproof "Point and Shoot," for example, the Nikon Coolpix AW120 экшн-камера, or, for example, rugged Hero3 + Silver Edition, both of which sold for about $300.</seg>
<seg id="4">I took these pictures on a family holiday with the help of several cameras, all for the price of about $350.</seg>
<seg id="5">No matter what equipment you use, the more rules you need to abide by, in order to achieve the best results.</seg>
<seg id="6">Перепроверяйте your equipment.</seg>
<seg id="7">Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure coin-cell battery cells and other compartments tightly closed.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, set up their camera for the type of photos or videos that you shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">In some photos and video cameras filming or object type is regimes that review the exposure for the mages underwater conditions.</seg>
<seg id="10">And before you jump in the water, look at how deep your equipment can fall.</seg>
<seg id="11">Some cameras are aimed only at 5 feet, others - 50 or 60 feet.</seg>
<seg id="12">Look at our leadership and customer ratings for both traditional and digital cameras, and for these models.</seg>
<seg id="13">Remove a few frames - because many of them do not manage.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Essentially" LCD that can help you assign shots, while экшн-камер them usually don't.</seg>
<seg id="15">Even if you have LCD, it will be difficult to see under the water, and the layout of the frame is a random process.</seg>
<seg id="16">So do a few frames.</seg>
<seg id="17">Also, if your camera is serial shooting mode, which takes several frames with a slightly different view of exposition, use them.</seg>
<seg id="18">Stay at the surface.</seg>
<seg id="19">Significantly reduces the amount of light, and the deeper you нырнете under water.</seg>
<seg id="20">If possible, stay at the surface, when you're shooting in the pool, the river or the ocean.</seg>
<seg id="21">It also allows you to transmit more colour in photographs; the deeper you get, the fewer colors you'll see.</seg>
<seg id="22">Подплывайте closer to objects.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is excellent advice for shooting on the land, but it is even more important under water because of the mages light conditions.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is especially important if you're shooting on экшн-камеру: This equipment often comes with a fixed, широкоугольной lens, which means that you have to get closer to objects, if you want to fill the frame.</seg>

<seg id="1">Andrew Lawson was such a man, whose force of personality could shake things around, even in such a giant organization like the National Health Service.</seg>
<seg id="2">Консультирующий anaesthetist, he has devoted his career deliverance patients as suffering from illness and the tortures of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="3">Among those who spoke to him, "recalled his wife, was an MI6 officer who had to live with devastating effects of torture.</seg>
<seg id="4">Lawson knew that as long as doctors are being diagnosed and diseases, those who undergoes treatment, primarily concerned about something completely different - the pain.</seg>
<seg id="5">One day in 2007, however, he appeared to those who suffer.</seg>
<seg id="6">"I never felt, as usual," he wrote in May last year.</seg>
<seg id="7">For me it was difficult to find in themselves the strength.</seg>
<seg id="8">Struggling with symptoms similar to flu, he found that his wife Джулиет reproaches irritably.</seg>
<seg id="9">"I want all happened sooner rather than later," he noted.</seg>
<seg id="10">When Джулиет went for a week, Lawson found that unusual and it is unclear why he was upset.</seg>
<seg id="11">Something was wrong.</seg>
<seg id="12">He asked a colleague to chest X-rays.</seg>
<seg id="13">Just two weeks before he went skiing in the French Alps in the Alps.</seg>
<seg id="14">Results of the X-rays came.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was mesothelioma, a terminal cancer, which affects плевру shell, or lungs.</seg>
<seg id="16">For most cancers, it is difficult to determine an exact cause.</seg>
<seg id="17">Although some people succumb to cancer of the lung, for example, not all lung cancer patients who smoked.</seg>
<seg id="18">But with mesothelioma differently.</seg>
<seg id="19">In almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, grainy construction material, who once called the "miracle," but which, as we now know, mortally dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="20">For most of us mesothelioma is a disease that you don't pay attention.</seg>
<seg id="21">Asbestos, in the end, "the material from the past.</seg>
<seg id="22">The most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in the UK since the 1960s, when these industrial ban came into force.</seg>
<seg id="23">Even when it has been used, only people from specific sectors worked in close contact with him: Трубоизолировщики, builders, carpenters and workers dock-Yards, for example.</seg>
<seg id="24">Industrial toxin from another era, he hardly seems cause for concern today.</seg>
<seg id="25">But such a calm erroneously.</seg>
<seg id="26">Britain, it turns out, is now at the peak of the epidemic мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="27">Here from мезотелиомы dies more people than in any other country on the planet.</seg>
<seg id="28">The annual death rate at about 2500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease than as a result of road crashes.</seg>
<seg id="29">The annual number of deaths from мезотелиомы since 1980 and projected the number of deaths in the future in the UK</seg>
<seg id="30">The reason we feel its deadly consequences right now, lies in the fact that, although the use of asbestos and it is illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), for the development of мезотелиомы go usually tens of years.</seg>
<seg id="31">And the problem is not limited to veterans мезотелиомы specialties industrial construction.</seg>
<seg id="32">Asbestos was and, in many cases, remains in the house where we live, where we work, schools, where we learn, and shops, where we go shopping.</seg>
<seg id="33">As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention in class, the level of income, profession or age.</seg>
<seg id="34">Избранности bastions of fashionable London department stores to private schools, as it turned out, not salvation.</seg>
<seg id="35">The parliament building is riddled with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="36">Even the hospital, which is intended to treat us, turned out to be reservoirs of this mortal a carcinogen.</seg>
<seg id="37">Andrew Lawson was not old.</seg>
<seg id="38">He was not трубоизолировщиком.</seg>
<seg id="39">Strictly speaking, he had to think where he might have come into contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Then he realized.</seg>
<seg id="41">"It seems that there might be a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital where I spent six years on an internship," he wrote.</seg>
<seg id="42">All were students, nurses, doctors and chance - used these тоннелями.</seg>
<seg id="43">I wonder how many of my peers expect the same disease?</seg>
<seg id="44">This was a question to which, unfortunately, he was able to give a partial response.</seg>
<seg id="45">"Of the four doctors who just need to be in the hospital for Guy and which have subsequently developed mesothelioma for the past five years," he said in a letter in 2010, "I alone remained alive."</seg>
<seg id="46">How many of us expect this disease?</seg>
<seg id="47">Andrew Лоусону was diagnosed with "mesothelioma," when he was 48 years old.</seg>
<seg id="48">When he died on February 17 this year, he was 55.</seg>
<seg id="49">Live so long is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="50">Fifty percent of patients die from mesothelioma eight months after diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="51">She always lethal.</seg>
<seg id="52">Thus, we can now only repeat Лоусона question: "How many of us expect this disease?"</seg>
<seg id="53">According to a leading expert in the UK, Professor Джулиану мезотелиоме Пито, most likely assume that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain should an individual die themselves about success.</seg>
<seg id="54">Most now are not what would die that way.</seg>
<seg id="55">Asbestos mine in Quebec, Canada telecentres are being set up</seg>
<seg id="56">A quick review of reports from court, where victims are often seek compensation, shows how far it has spread attack мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="57">In June, for example, Marks & Spencer acknowledged that the Christian-Democrats Джэнис Ellen contact with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="58">She worked for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, apparel departments at two sites, one of which was the store on Oxford Street.</seg>
<seg id="59">Mrs Ellen was just 18 years old, when she started working at M & S.</seg>
<seg id="60">Now her two children are older than 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="61">"Before this happened," she says, "I had never heard about мезотелиоме, I barely knew about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="62">Me in the head and could not come, so that will affect me.</seg>
<seg id="63">Few people really know a lot about Асбесте.</seg>
<seg id="64">In fact, asbestos is not one substance, and a group of six minerals.</seg>
<seg id="65">They get their name from the word "асбестиформ", which means the fibrous structure, which tells them the strength and flexibility.</seg>
<seg id="66">Of those six, three were often used in construction.</seg>
<seg id="67">Chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos, far more often than other occurs in buildings today.</seg>
<seg id="68">It has been used in roofing panels, напольной thermal insulation, boilers, pipes and toilets, even in brake колодках cars.</seg>
<seg id="69">He смертелен less than other forms of asbestos, but still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization "major source of harm to health," which can lead to death.</seg>
<seg id="70">More dangerous, however, brown asbestos (амозит) and blue asbestos (крокидолит).</seg>
<seg id="71">Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos in the world, and experts have speculated that "there are good, though indirect reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with mesothelioma [in the UK]."</seg>
<seg id="72">Employee Marks & Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the main company shop on Oxford Street, London telecentres are being set up</seg>
<seg id="73">Джэнис Ellen may not have thought of yourself as a victim, but Julian Пито мезотелиомы work suggests that her story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="74">He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that "a substantial percentage of мезотелиом when there is no known exposure at work or at home, were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment."</seg>
<seg id="75">Much of this impact, he says, is "regular use and exposure to weather" in our buildings.</seg>
<seg id="76">No one, it seems, can't be sure that he is safe.</seg>
<seg id="77">The report Goddard Consulting, which addressed Westminster Palace, demonstrates how people, even in the heart of the Government could be exposed to unconsciously.</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2009, Goddard said that technical mines and pipelines for the premises of parliamentary committees were infected with deadly asbestos fibres, which may be given in the movement, something so harmless as "strong currents of air."</seg>
<seg id="79">Members of the parliament often blame in that they are pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems that the opposite is true.</seg>
<seg id="80">Although the dish on the maintenance of Parliament insisted that Westminster Palace received a "clean bill of health," and now she recognized that it is necessary to work on the £1 billion for the reconstruction of the Parliament, by upgrading electrician and removing asbestos, and that after the general election in 2015, members of parliament, the country will meet in the conference centre nearby, but not on the green benches was.</seg>
<seg id="81">Goddard report noted that "the situation with no asbestos was ruled in accordance with different rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">It is impossible to know whether this error management cost lives.</seg>
<seg id="83">All we can do now is wait.</seg>
<seg id="84">One of those who could not identify their exposure to asbestos is Graham, Shell, general practitioner.</seg>
<seg id="85">As Andrew Lawson, Shell, 50 years, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="86">"I worked at the hospital, which has successfully brought claims associated with asbestos," he says, "But I can't prove this in my case.</seg>
<seg id="87">It's so hard to remember all the places where he worked, and dates.</seg>
<seg id="88">He remembers clearly that day in early December 2009 when his wholly overcame something that was like the flu.</seg>
<seg id="89">He was 45, and he was in the middle of an operation later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="90">Suddenly were shaken as me.</seg>
<seg id="91">It started very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="92">I felt terrible.</seg>
<seg id="93">I thought I can't drive all the way to homes.</seg>
<seg id="94">Being a doctor, Shell knew that pain comes from, including checking for iframe loads, shell around the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="95">However, like Джэнис Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect мезотелиому.</seg>
<seg id="96">Eventually, he couldn't walk for a month.</seg>
<seg id="97">Operation doctors were doing chest x-rays and плевральные катетеры to pull fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis.</seg>
<seg id="98">And yet his condition оставлось without the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="99">Gradually, his health improved and he returned to work.</seg>
<seg id="100">But from time to time, those same symptoms return, often after he engaged in sports, and he breathed heavily.</seg>
<seg id="101">In 2011, one of the patients came to him in Dubai office with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma "."</seg>
<seg id="102">But even then, Shell has not linked it with its own case.</seg>
<seg id="103">In the end, his patient was on ten years older and worked with asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="104">In this case, the connection was obvious.</seg>
<seg id="105">In September 2011, the state of Dubai deteriorated again, and listened to his doctor revealed the results of the CT and X-ray images of a group of experts.</seg>
<seg id="106">In December 2011, after exactly two years after Shell began to feel ill, sensor, equipped with a camera, was introduced into his chest cavity between the shell and shell of his lung.</seg>
<seg id="107">I'm an optimist.</seg>
<seg id="108">I usually just go further, "he said.</seg>
<seg id="109">I'm not too upset about it, to be honest.</seg>
<seg id="110">But Rachel, my wife, experienced.</seg>
<seg id="111">Biopsy results came in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told that mesothelioma."</seg>
<seg id="112">Graham, Shell mesothelioma diagnosis:</seg>
<seg id="113">Shell suddenly sank during a meeting with nurses Macmillan, one of which suggested he contact a lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="114">It was then that he realised the scale of the epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="115">"It turns out that asbestos is widely used, especially in large public buildings, and where quite often there was asbestos thermal insulation systems on the planet," he says.</seg>
<seg id="116">People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings, now succumb to the disease.</seg>
<seg id="117">Thus, mesothelioma now affects more young people, atypical professions.</seg>
<seg id="118">The most dangerous isolated asbestos pipes in hospitals were in basements, so it is unlikely to hurt patients.</seg>
<seg id="119">But many employees who were on the pedestrian tunnels connecting nearby landmasses can bring together to get from one building to another (as Andrew Lawson), or eat in canteens подвальных (how often did Graham, Shell) almost certainly really were exposed to toxic substances.</seg>
<seg id="120">For several decades after the war, as it turns out, the hospital was a place where, theoretically, legalistic поциентов for life, but the place, which constituted a threat to life for doctors who treated them.</seg>
<seg id="121">It still continues to resonate today.</seg>
<seg id="122">Students set their burners Бунзена asbestos on tap</seg>
<seg id="123">And it's not just hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="124">Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and мэриях because of his amazing insulating and if characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="125">Schools too.</seg>
<seg id="126">Strictly speaking, many are likely to have been exposed to asbestos in the classroom for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="127">Nationwide, on countless lessons chemistry students set their burners Бунзена asbestos on tap.</seg>
<seg id="128">There were websites highlighting the problem of asbestos in schools.</seg>
<seg id="129">Meanwhile, in our homes, such harmless things as floor tiles or roof сараев typically contained asbestos.</seg>
<seg id="130">"This is an industrial poison, disease," notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Лоусона Gaia in a case against the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="131">In one case, the only contact, about whom she could recall the woman, was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="132">So be careful, снося garden sheds.</seg>
<seg id="133">The effect of the diagnosis, when we know that the disease is incurable, is huge.</seg>
<seg id="134">"To realize it, is quite a lot of time," says Graham, Shell.</seg>
<seg id="135">I went back to work and tried to continue, but I realised that I couldn't focus on what I'm doing.</seg>
<seg id="136">I spent two weeks in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="137">Then I realized that I had to go and deal with them.</seg>
<seg id="138">Well, I will not be met by Christmas</seg>
<seg id="139">One of the most difficult things was the transition from doctor to patient.</seg>
<seg id="140">As countless patients before him, he remembers, was confused as the amount of information that had to be taken.</seg>
<seg id="141">"It was difficult to understand," he says.</seg>
<seg id="142">"I asked his doctor" how many I have time? "</seg>
<seg id="143">Gave me about 12 months.</seg>
<seg id="144">I remember I thought, "Well, I will not be met by Christmas.</seg>
<seg id="145">That's all. "</seg>
<seg id="146">Mesothelioma is particularly dangerous, as it is the mechanics of how we support life, "is itself an act of breathing -- causes cancer, which kills.</seg>
<seg id="147">Most cases are caused by contact with asbestos мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="148">Composed of tiny asbestos fibres.</seg>
<seg id="149">When asbestos is being destroyed and the carcinogenic fibers, they can get stuck in плевре shell, the lungs.</seg>
<seg id="150">Irritating плевру asbestos fibers and may cause cell mutations.</seg>
<seg id="151">"The problem is due to the inhalation of asbestos fibres needle," Professor Tom Трежер кардиоторакальный, a surgeon, who came to the hospital in 2001, Guy.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is the hospital, where, as suspected, Andrew Lawson, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of мезотелиомы.</seg>
<seg id="153">Трежер Лоусона knew and treated some of the others who, perhaps, was exposed to while in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="154">When Sally Goodin Sally goodun Etc lyrics of asbestos in lung tissue, "says Трежер breathing them unload on the periphery, where the shell.</seg>
<seg id="155">This is, essentially, an invasive process from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="156">Conventional treatments of other forms of cancer is much less effective at мезотелиоме.</seg>
<seg id="157">The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, cause hot debate.</seg>
<seg id="158">Some think it is worth a try.</seg>
<seg id="159">Трежер disagrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">"You can't cut плевру," he says.</seg>
<seg id="161">The size is around her with a knife.</seg>
<seg id="162">Meanwhile, this cancer chemotherapy is "not very well", which "acts", but not people.</seg>
<seg id="163">"From time to time there are patients who live for a long time," says Трежер.</seg>
<seg id="164">But ultimately, they all die.</seg>
<seg id="165">Fortunately, some patients are living much, much longer than expected.</seg>
<seg id="166">Writer Stephen Jay Gould died in 20 years after he was diagnosed.</seg>
<seg id="167">Two and a half years after diagnosis, Graham, Shell continues to fight.</seg>
<seg id="168">After he became ill from mesothelioma, Dubai introduced Andrew Лоусоном, who, four years after diagnosis, single-handedly turned the Support Office and consultation for these same patients.</seg>
<seg id="169">"Yes, Раковая Central," he said, cheerfully when they rang.</seg>
<seg id="170">"He was very positive," says Shell.</seg>
<seg id="171">He was diagnosed four years ago, and he still is very energetic.</seg>
<seg id="172">First Эбботту offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and prolonged his life only a month.</seg>
<seg id="173">"I was in despair," he says.</seg>
<seg id="174">I wanted to give up.</seg>
<seg id="175">Lawson, nevertheless, "managed to somewhat more positive agenda."</seg>
<seg id="176">Meeting with several specialists, we decided to continue treatment with Professor Лоиком Ланж-Лаздунски торакальной, professor of surgery at Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="177">"We had an advantage in that I don't need it, I just called them and they took me," admits Graham.</seg>
<seg id="178">Likely the patient would have to get the direction and approval for funding.</seg>
<seg id="179">Money plays a decisive role for patients with mesothelioma, to get the best available treatments.</seg>
<seg id="180">But when such treatments become ineffective, finally, inevitably, many patients are facing another financial reason for concern "about the future of families that they would leave.</seg>
<seg id="181">And then they ask the courts for compensation.</seg>
<seg id="182">Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan, of Field Fisher Price Waterhouse LLP.</seg>
<seg id="183">"It has been known that asbestos is harmful to health, since 1898," said Morgan.</seg>
<seg id="184">But that changed in the 1960s, it is that it became clear that even very small amounts can put their health at risk.</seg>
<seg id="185">It was then spoke about the bad faith of companies.</seg>
<seg id="186">Andrew Lawson and hospital Guy ultimately resolve it, but it was not a "settlement at full price," according to Morgan, as Lawson could not clearly prove that his mesothelioma was a result of exposure to asbestos at Guy's Hospital.</seg>
<seg id="187">After the investigation into his death, a spokesman for the hospital, Guy was confirmed, however, that "asbestos in its basement, mentioned above, was removed in the 1990s."</seg>
<seg id="188">It was too late for Andrew Лоусона.</seg>
<seg id="189">How to remove asbestos</seg>
<seg id="190">In fact, tie deadly contact with asbestos to one company or place of work - usually through dozens of years after that, it turned out to be a big problem for patients with mesothelioma, demanding compensation.</seg>
<seg id="191">Many of their former employers have the owner or shut down.</seg>
<seg id="192">Insurance archives could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="193">And those who have protected from lawsuits, knows that time is on their side, plaintiffs have, of course, no.</seg>
<seg id="194">In response, this year took serious new legislative acts which facilitate patients with mesothelioma process to recover compensation, even if their former employers are impossible to trace.</seg>
<seg id="195">In accordance with this law, was created by £350-миллионный fund of funds, which is financed by the insurance industry, and for those who was diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove the contact, but who is not expected to sue.</seg>
<seg id="196">In such cases, patients will receive 80 percent of the amount that the court could award in a case about the compensation of around £120,000.</seg>
<seg id="197">About 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected each year.</seg>
<seg id="198">Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with mesothelioma, believes that the £350 million represent a "very good job" for the insurance industry.</seg>
<seg id="199">"This transaction, written by companies for insurers," he says, hinting that the sum is a quarter of that, insurers would have to pay if it hadn't intervened time and patients with mesothelioma could track the company and file a lawsuit in the usual way.</seg>
<seg id="200">Even Mike Пеннинг, formerly the minister of labour and pensions, acknowledged that the law "imperfect."</seg>
<seg id="201">But Пеннинг, and Morgan acknowledged that, in view of the fact that seven people die every day, rapid action was needed.</seg>
<seg id="202">"People suffer so much, and they need help now," said Пеннинг during the second reading of the Bill of мезотелиоме in December last year.</seg>
<seg id="203">By the time Graham, Shell was in the hands of Professor Лоика Ланж-Лаздунски 19 months.</seg>
<seg id="204">After the initial consultation Ланж-Лаздунски recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Трежера, he believes to be effective.</seg>
<seg id="205">This was followed by радиотерапия and chemotherapy - тритерапия Ланж-Лаздунски, which boasts pristine 40 percent of patients surviving for five years.</seg>
<seg id="206">We felt a surge of strength.</seg>
<seg id="207">"This is, of course, one of the most important things," says Shell.</seg>
<seg id="208">You see these patients all the time.</seg>
<seg id="209">There is a force that supports you.</seg>
<seg id="210">When сдаешься, condition can deteriorate very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="211">Graham, Shell went to the surgery in March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="212">By the end of August he finished last of six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="213">Subsequent scan showed no trace of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="214">Then I had a scan in March [2014].</seg>
<seg id="215">There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.</seg>
<seg id="216">I just had to be fulfilled.</seg>
<seg id="217">This is not a threat to life.</seg>
<seg id="218">It's the end of life.</seg>
<seg id="219">And once again we went through six cycles of chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="220">Now there is no trace of cancer.</seg>
<seg id="221">However, this process is both physically and emotionally heavy.</seg>
<seg id="222">You can think about practical things - about finances, and when I die, for example, or about the fact that we need to show his wife, as work on бойлере timer.</seg>
<seg id="223">When you get bad news, you become безрадостным.</seg>
<seg id="224">You need to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="225">As the father of Ellie, 16 years old, and Тэмзин, 14 years old, it is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="226">"It's hard for the parent," he says.</seg>
<seg id="227">It's hard to understand what to say and how much to say.</seg>
<seg id="228">For the first time when I was diagnosed, I told the girls that I had the disease, which means that I won ’ t live to old age.</seg>
<seg id="229">They reacted very differently.</seg>
<seg id="230">Тэмзин very social and energetic.</seg>
<seg id="231">She told all of his friends, and we need to very quickly call for many.</seg>
<seg id="232">Ellie was more demure.</seg>
<seg id="233">She didn't say much.</seg>
<seg id="234">Such talk is something with which to confront all patients with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="235">But for patients with mesothelioma such discussion, even visions of people hope to survive.</seg>
<seg id="236">This disease of sex is (even as, ultimately, for Steven Jay Гулда) grim certainty.</seg>

<seg id="1">China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters profess revenge</seg>
<seg id="2">China's parliament decided Sunday to not allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite the growing demands for democratic reforms.</seg>
<seg id="3">Such a move is likely to mark the beginning of long being protests in Hong Kong as activists have begun planning and mobilization in a matter of hours after that statement.</seg>
<seg id="4">The decision of the 11th National People's Congress, in essence, allows the communist leaders, who did not remove all the candidates loyal to Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="5">"It's not обмануло our expectations, but still leads in rage," said lawmaker Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This is not something that Beijing has promised.</seg>
<seg id="7">They lied to people in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="8">And it is obvious that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.</seg>
<seg id="9">Defending the decision of China, Li Fey, Deputy General Secretary of the Standing Committee of the 11th National People's Congress, said that to allow the public to vote on the nomination of Hong Kong would be too "erratic behavior."</seg>
<seg id="10">Since 1997, when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing promised to allow residents of the region through a vote to choose the head of government, starting in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Sunday, Chinese leaders have taken the decision as a democratic step forward, since it gives гонконгцам right to direct the vote; however, the decision also makes clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process in his hands with the help of the Commission on the appointment of candidates, rigidly controlled from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="12">And, according to a new article that only candidates who "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be admitted.</seg>
<seg id="13">The decision was taken after the summer, when there have been some of the most expansive and received wide coverage of the protests in Hong Kong for many years.</seg>
<seg id="14">For a large part of the campaign is a movement in Hong Kong after Occupy Central With Love and Peace, which threatened to cut off the financial district in Hong Kong if Beijing does not guarantee a real universal suffrage.</seg>
<seg id="15">On Sunday evening, just a few hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central gathered in the rain in front of the government headquarters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the demonstration, the organizers claimed that their movement is shifting to a new phase of civil disobedience and that they rise up on the waves of protest in the next few weeks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, they have not reported the details, apparently seeking to avoid problems with government bodies.</seg>
<seg id="18">In онлайн-заявлении, the organizers said the movement "обдумывало any capture of the central district only as an exceptional measure, action that can be taken only if all the possibilities of the dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.</seg>
<seg id="19">We regret to inform you that today, all possibilities have been exhausted and the dialogue will certainly capture the central district.</seg>
<seg id="20">Authorities in Hong Kong were preparing to Beijing a few days, and on Sunday at the headquarters of the government had strengthened security measures involving police and barricades.</seg>
<seg id="21">The unrest is a sense among many in Hong Kong, that they are slowly losing control over their city.</seg>
<seg id="22">The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also intensifies the fear that Hong Kong's values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, and begin to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some have criticised the Occupy Central movement, saying that his demonstration to jeopardize the businesses - the lifeblood of Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="25">"The protest, which they say it could cause great economic damage, depending on how many people will participate, and for how long," said lawmaker Regina Yip, who has long been critical of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="26">We don't want to spread concern about the fact that Hong Kong is getting out of control.</seg>
<seg id="27">This view, which is harmful for investment.</seg>
<seg id="28">Chinese state media have also reported in recent days, in which the activists of the democratic movement in Hong Kong were shown billion направляемыми, Western powers.</seg>
<seg id="29">This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral law, which drew 780000 participants - more than one-fifth of voters in Hong Kong.</seg>
<seg id="30">And in July, tens of thousands took to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.</seg>

<seg id="6">This, combined with our new options for Vif, we look forward to what will help students get to university this year, with minimum effort and maximum luxury.</seg>
<seg id="7">A spokesman said that, because the service had only just launched, the orders had not yet received, but added that "the students begin to order this service in the next few weeks."</seg>
<seg id="8">The company also said that, despite the fact that the students should be the need to pay tuition fees of £9,000 a year, she still hopes to find a market for this service.</seg>

<seg id="11">Megan Dunn, vice-president of NAC on Higher Education, said: "This project is incredibly taken away from a life of the majority of students.</seg>

<seg id="1">Feminists are raising questions of racial identity and behavior of police after Ferguson</seg>
<seg id="2">Unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Фергюсоне, Missouri, earlier this month.</seg>
<seg id="3">Coming raise hands, chanting: "Hands up, don't стреляй" while they wait in line in front of Mr..</seg>
<seg id="4">After two weeks of protests in Фергюсоне, Missouri, associated with the murder of teenager Michael Brown, Scale blogger Miriam зоила Perez noticed the shift in интернет-разговоре among white feminists.</seg>
<seg id="5">In her experience, the white feminists stamps comments put gender above race, when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, as the tension rose in the Midwest and attracted national attention, Peres saw the white women who is 100 percent focused on the race.</seg>
<seg id="7">Compared with the reaction of black women shortly after the killing on 9 August, personal essays with such titles as "thoughts about Фергюсоне on behalf of a white woman" and "Феминизм is not only about the Savings ampamp women" appeared relatively late.</seg>
<seg id="8">But for Perez, they demonstrated a significant shift.</seg>
<seg id="9">"In feminism, I don't think there are many people who are talking about white skin and Privileges on such a high level," she said.</seg>
<seg id="10">People feel the need to say something about what has happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It's very symbolic for the crisis with which we are faced, and because of the situation in Фергюсоне) is so tied to race, they feel that at this point.</seg>
<seg id="12">For a professor of English at the University of Ohio Кориты Mitchell Ferguson has laid bare problems with which the black American lady face every day, but which are not perceived as a "women's problems" in the cultural sphere.</seg>
<seg id="13">"I can write something funny on Facebook about what's going on with me and my partner and get 150 лайков from everywhere," says Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="14">When I write something about how colored people are attacked in his own country, silence stuns.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Why are women so publicly talk about relationships, but not about the security in the public sector?" She asks.</seg>
<seg id="16">For black women, like Mitchell, who studied the issues of race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between matters relating to race and gender.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her view, black women are in a position to clearly separate these problems; they are faced with a complex reality every day.</seg>
<seg id="18">While white women now bring together issues of race and gender in feminist мейнстриме, Энджела Хэттери, professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that its predecessor did the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Between 1865 and 1890 линчевали for years, at least 10,000 black men, it is almost always served and the rape of a white woman," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="20">There was a white woman, proves narrative to justify Nepal.</seg>
<seg id="21">From the point of view of Хэттери, the gap between white and black women occurred when White free, for instance, Susan B. Anthony looked at the situation in the late 1800s, and saw that the fight for suffrage will be effective only for one of the groups: Women or blacks.</seg>
<seg id="22">"They have decided to lay all the eggs in the basket of voting rights for women, and the right to vote for blacks was to appear later," said Хэттери.</seg>
<seg id="23">To look back on things like this gives us a clear idea of why colored women don't trust white women.</seg>
<seg id="24">We have not done anything good.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even after women won the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years to white women united against mob lynchings in the South for the prevention of mob lynchings Women's Association.</seg>
<seg id="27">This group emerged after almost 40 years after he was first asked to help blacks, women, said Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="28">Mitchell, from the point of view of the reactions of white feminists on the issues raised in Фергюсоне, "the conduct of the police, racial discrimination - reflects a time when white a feminist had to" catch up "problems with which the black women live up in several generations.</seg>
<seg id="29">"However, it would be great if a militant, which have such a [traditional феминистическая] ideology, so seriously would be to raise a child, how they relate to the right to contraception?" Asked Mitchell.</seg>
<seg id="30">The second wave feminists who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to контрацептивам, now you are beginning to understand what that means.</seg>
<seg id="31">Known white activist Gloria Стайнем феминистического movement two weeks after the killing of Michael Brown and the UK published an article took Фейсбуком колумнистки Guardian Rebecca Carroll, who claimed that white Americans took more participation in protests on issues of racism.</seg>
<seg id="32">"I hope that women who have a different, but similar reason to understand the danger, repeated in the body - and the point of view of the racial problems that are substantially different in surveys of the public - will be at the head of the change," wrote Стайнем.</seg>
<seg id="33">Although Стайнем is responsible for more than пересекающийся feminism, which includes and issues of race and gender, her comments about race in America still surprise some.</seg>
<seg id="34">The American entrepreneurial institute researcher Christina Соммерс, author of “Who stole feminism?," she said She The People, that young men of color in the United States, especially to young people, "is much more vulnerable than their sisters', but on the contrary Фергюсоне Стайнем negative criticism, which it clear earlier.</seg>
<seg id="35">We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for the boys.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, when the White House has recently initiated a programme, "Сторож my brother" to help the vulnerable black and испаноговорящим boys, followed US changed remarkably for the reaction from many feminists, including those from Gloria Стайнем.</seg>
<seg id="37">Police relationship with the black community is not the only problem, продвигающая helm of traditional feminism.</seg>
<seg id="38">After the U.S. Border Guard Service arrested around 63000 unaccompanied minors at the southwestern border of the country this year, immigration reform again came to the surface - this time as a problem with women.</seg>

<seg id="40">"They speak for themselves," said China.</seg>
<seg id="41">When the vast majority of working visas are issued [иммигрантам-мужчинам], women who come with them, find themselves in positions vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.</seg>

<seg id="2">This week the Ministry of Economic Development will make the government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally clean vehicles in Russia, told the deputy director of the ministry, Oleg Плужников at the round table, which held the newspaper Vedomosti declared in Moscow - 2014.</seg>
<seg id="3">The plan drawn up on behalf of the government, one of the main goals - reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is expected that the document will be passed in late September-early October, said that the proposed measures concerning Плужников electric cars or hybrids - vehicles on the development plan газомоторном fuel in Russia already have.</seg>
<seg id="5">(A copy of the plan obtained by Vedomosti is designed for 2014-2017.</seg>
<seg id="6">They want to develop assessment criteria electricity and hybrid vehicles and decide how to promote the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="7">The government report, which will be outlined tax and customs measures to support quality, will be prepared by December 2014; concessional lending scheme and a preferential leasing will emerge by April 2015, and proposals to reduce the prices of cars, and the creation of service the infrastructure will be developed by October 2015</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014-2015, proposed to amend the regulations to ease conditions for construction зарядной infrastructure (in carparks, filling stations, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="9">In addition, federal officials plan for 2015 to formulate proposals for regional authorities to also promote the use of environmentally clean transport - in the form of granting him benefits when driving and parking, for example; and at the end of February 2016 - and proposals for expanding government purchases of such transport.</seg>
<seg id="10">Finally, the Ministry of Economic Development by October 2014 will bring in a list of indicators to assess the work of regional authorities of criteria that reflect the effectiveness of support production of environmentally clean transport development зарядной infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="11">Single market in Russia is still only formed in 2013 across the country sold around 100 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="12">In early 2014 обнулена import duty on electric cars, so sales will be approximately 500 pieces, predicts CEO of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia, Andrey Pankov.</seg>
<seg id="13">But A. growth does not make any noticeable: Electric cars in Russia in 2013, according to the Association of European Businesses, sold ARP million cars and light commercial vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="14">While Sunderland in Russia imports only Mitsubishi Motors.</seg>
<seg id="15">Start import preparing Renault - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients, says director for strategic planning and partnerships at Renault in Russia Nicolas Ремиз.</seg>
<seg id="16">Most other manufacturers of electric vehicles took in relation to Russia is taking a wait-and-see approach.</seg>
<seg id="17">Development of electric cars and Russian manufacturers GAZ directors "," ",", "but the trivial.</seg>
<seg id="18">For example, in January - July 2014, according to the "АСМ-холдинга," Avtovaz has issued 30 electric cars.</seg>
<seg id="19">Modest because of the high demand for electric cars, admits director of AvtoVAZ on 17 June, Sergei Аманов, without state support the breakthrough in this segment will not.</seg>
<seg id="20">The development of the Russian market in addition to the new electric cars (those electric cars that are sold in Russia, on average, twice as much as rivals with internal combustion engines) holds an underdeveloped зарядной infrastructure (retails sites - units), and sighs, "Sergei Целиков Автостата brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="21">Because of the high cost and low rates of decline in Sunderland in the next 3-4 years remain нишевым segment of the Russian market, "predicts editor-in-chief Mikhail Подорожанский Авторевю Целиков, agrees with him.</seg>
<seg id="22">Car manufacturers, in contrast, say that some models of electric cars is already close to the value of the ordinary.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Russian market is substantially good prospects, the important thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "real" электромобильность; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of the new charging stations, underscores the president Wolfgang Шлимме BMW Group in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="24">Such infrastructure projects, for example, is "Россети госкомпания": In Moscow built several stations, soon there will be more about 80.</seg>
<seg id="25">Talks about building a network of retails sites are being carried out with other regions.</seg>
<seg id="26">According to the director of the department "Россетей Vladimir Софьина, the company believes the market is ready to build electric and gas stations across the country, but there are problems: A small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging different brands.</seg>
<seg id="27">In addition, "Россети" as network the company does not have the right to engage in the sale of electricity, being able to do this in relation to charging.</seg>
<seg id="28">His wife believes the most effective measure in support of Russia's market substantially progeSOFT customs duties.</seg>
<seg id="29">Zero rate will act before the end of 2014, the Company is exploring the possibility of its renewal and expansion of the preferential list.</seg>
<seg id="30">The replacement vehicle tax on ecological (the idea is being discussed and concerns all machines), too, will support the market, but not as noticeably as customs preferences, according to his wife.</seg>
<seg id="31">Tax in Russia is small, said Pankov, unlike, for example, from Norway, where the reduced tax rate led to a sharp rise in sales of electric cars -- now they account for 12 percent of the market.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, and the need for stimulus measures, such as free parking in the city centre (as has been done in Moscow), I am sure Pankov, or any movement of dedicated lanes for electric cars, which are not yet in Russia.</seg>

<seg id="6">On the night of August 29, the White House said U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will discuss the possibility of imposing additional sanctions against Russia.</seg>
<seg id="7">The weakening of the ruble is long-term in nature and, in tandem with the euro, and in tandem with the dollar.</seg>
<seg id="8">Long-term forecast assumed that mark, "says senior analyst" Альпари "Anna Bodrov's.</seg>
<seg id="9">All of that has to do with Ukraine, one way or another will be reflected on the courses.</seg>
<seg id="10">As long as this continues, investors will react.</seg>
<seg id="11">Today, rumors about the invading troops not confirmed nor on the one hand, but the market was very emotional.</seg>
<seg id="12">All the talk about the fact that he has been stable for such news, yesterday were перечеркнуты.</seg>
<seg id="13">A week, according to forecasts, will be closed around these levels - 36,90 and 37,05 roubles per dollar.</seg>
<seg id="14">The tax period ended, oil prices, weak policies, sanctions, the issue of gas transit via Ukraine - it all links in the same chain.</seg>
<seg id="15">Also projected inflation accelerates to current prices for fall by end-2010 from 5 to 10 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon, the same end, seasonal vegetables and fruits, and there will be a vacuum, so long as the network being reoriented toward other suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="17">"The dollar went up to 37 rubles, passed it and came back, some powerful hysteria," commented Head of analysis of markets "Opening Broker" Konstantin Bushuev.</seg>
<seg id="18">Still, will look at whether to impose sanctions, as promised on Saturday will meet NATO.</seg>
<seg id="19">He said the ruble weakened sharply after the tax season, then went to news on Ukraine, the Central Bank said last week that, until the end of the year will be transferred to a floating exchange rate and waives any currency interventions.</seg>
<seg id="20">If you look at the daytime wobble, it is no different from the previous ones during this month, all have spooked that mark in 37 rubles, "continues the analyst.</seg>
<seg id="21">And so, in terms of turnover and powerful, nothing has happened.</seg>
<seg id="22">Worrying times for the currency market were, as I recall when, in late January highlighted the strong demand for the currency, as well as 3rd March, when the Central Bank отгрузил a record number of currency.</seg>
<seg id="23">In UFS IC see the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.</seg>
<seg id="24">First of all, the growth of revenue from export operations, as well as improving the competitiveness of the domestic manufacturers at the expense of more expensive imports, says chief analyst UFS IC Alexei Kozlov.</seg>
<seg id="25">The negative moments can be attributed to the rise in prices of imported goods and services.</seg>
<seg id="26">Sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency to significantly reduce the attractiveness of investment in the Russian economy, rising inflation pressures and, as a consequence, are the cause of more expensive borrowing cash, which, in turn, slows down the development of the economy.</seg>
<seg id="27">If we talk about the stock market, the rouble devaluation in mainstreaming a decline in stock prices, expressed in roubles.</seg>
<seg id="28">For example, the MICEX index during trading Thursday fell 1.67 per cent, while the RTS Index lost 3.27 percent.</seg>
<seg id="29">Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of reduction of indices due to the weakening of the ruble during the day more than 1.5%.</seg>
<seg id="30">The weakening of the ruble is an emotional character and explains the massive desire to buy the currency.</seg>
<seg id="31">In practice, gradually emotions go on, and the price of the ruble partially or fully restore lost ground.</seg>
<seg id="32">"We believe, soon we will be able to see the value of the dollar and the Russian currency is near the level of 36 rubles to the dollar," said Alexei Kozlov.</seg>

<seg id="2">Восстанавливающаяся economy means more customers, the more sales and jobs.</seg>
<seg id="3">It also means higher taxes.</seg>
<seg id="4">Account for taxes on the state and local level for companies across the country, rose modestly last year, when an accelerated recovery, according to a new study, published last week, and the company in the Washington area is no exception.</seg>
<seg id="5">Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $27.6 billion in the coffers of the state and local level in fiscal 2013, to 3.8 percent more than the $26.6 billion collected in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="6">The tax burden on business for the state and local level in the past year rose by 4.3 per cent, to $671 billion, compared with 3.9 per cent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after avoiding each other years when smaller accounts in 2009 and 2010.</seg>
<seg id="7">State taxes, rose 4.3 percent, faster than the local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to the study, which was conducted by providing professional services, Ernst & Young and the taxation of the taxation policy group.</seg>
<seg id="8">More than half of the tax revenue in the county, 56 percent in taxes on entrepreneurs, while 36 percent of tax revenue for Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="9">Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the amount of tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.</seg>
<seg id="10">To a large extent, the growth of tax revenues caused by returning to the same level of the value of real estate companies, the researchers say, that raised property taxes by 3.7 per cent this year, after three years in a row, when growth was less than 1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="11">While a large proportion of these revenues are concentrated in big states such as California, New York and Texas, it appears that the same thing is happening in the Washington area.</seg>
<seg id="12">Companies in the District, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion for property taxes on the state and local level in the past year, to $9.6 billion more than in 2012 - a rise of 4.2 per cent, compared with the previous year.</seg>
<seg id="13">However, the return of the value of the property does not have a similar effect on the growth of tax revenue for the state and local level in Maryland, where property taxes are unlikely to exceed one-fifth of companies' tax bills.</seg>
<seg id="14">Virginia and the District of Columbia's pay tax accounts for about half of the state and local level, in the form of property taxes.</seg>
<seg id="15">"What is happening in Maryland is that such a large part of its property tax base, particularly around the District of Columbia, is owned by either the government or the nonprofit organization, which does not pay property taxes," said Douglas Линдхолм, executive director of the Center on taxation.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, Maryland was forced, for example, rely far more on income taxes to pay for those services that exist in other states.</seg>
<seg id="17">The recent increase in tax receipts from businesses cannot fully explain the recovery of the real estate market.</seg>
<seg id="18">Income entrepreneurs also, it seems to me, is on the mend, according to this data.</seg>
<seg id="19">Chinese companies may increasingly raise capital in the company's corporate income tax on the state level, in the amount of $2.3 billion to $2.1 billion more than in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="20">Maryland has collected $1 billion of corporate income tax, most of all in the region.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although the trends are aimed in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level does not increase with the same speed in all three areas.</seg>
<seg id="22">The level of growth in the District of Columbia was at the same level as the average for the country of 4.3 per cent, while growth was significantly faster in Maryland, 4.9 percent.</seg>
<seg id="23">Only in Virginia was below the average rise in tax revenues, equal to 4.1 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="24">In Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax from three jurisdictions (each of which have the same corporate rate) equal to 6 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="25">In Maryland corporate rate is 8.25 percent, whereas in the District is relatively high - 9,975 percent.</seg>
<seg id="26">A similar study of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year in Virginia found that lower taxes for entrepreneurs on the state and local level and, on the whole, a more favorable climate in terms of taxes for entrepreneurs than in Maryland.</seg>
<seg id="27">The District has not assessed in this study.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite his advantage, Virginia is facing competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south.</seg>
<seg id="29">North Carolina recently signed a legislative act as corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same as in Virginia, the rate will fall to 5 percent in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="30">If the state continues to achieve goals by contrast in the next year, this law would bring the rate of income tax for entrepreneurs, even up to 3 per cent by 2017.</seg>
<seg id="31">Meanwhile, a small business in the Washington area, it seems, feels better, and thus pay more taxes on the state and local level, according to a recent study.</seg>
<seg id="32">Taxes for entrepreneurs, in the form of individual income tax paid by small business owners, a transition structure, which arranged the majority of small firms - in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, with far greater speed than taxes for предпринимателй in general.</seg>
<seg id="33">Researchers say the trend and an increase in revenues from taxes on businesses across the country are likely to persist this year, when tax revenues, with turnover in the governments of the state and local level, staying at 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.</seg>

<seg id="4">Their debut album, Leif is still several months before release received 100,000 предзаказов contract, and on his release lies in the portfolio will Warner Music.</seg>
<seg id="5">Given the present situation on the market, a musical плачевную situation from a dominating, because this is not about new Lana del Ray, or another сладкоголосом representative "of the new R 'n' B ', but the British duo быковатых on playing with the level of volume and intensity, that the last time was in vogue two decades ago.</seg>
<seg id="6">In general, rates on the first album in connection with all вышеозначенными circumstances were especially high, and is hollow.</seg>

<seg id="9">To make predictions about the success of this enterprise until, perhaps, pretty early, but you can have something to say.</seg>

<seg id="3">The news was a surprise, not because no one expected that it would be sold, but because many people expected that YouTube will be a buyer.</seg>
<seg id="4">Three months ago it sold over a billion Google видеосервису looked completely finished, and this combination was a natural.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set a goal to be потоковым service general nature - version of YouTube in real time.</seg>

<seg id="7">It is the interface.</seg>
<seg id="8">And "Widow's play" genre movies, in which всезнайки give (mainly old) games, as in "Таинственном theatre", already popular on YouTube.</seg>
<seg id="9">The fact that YouTube is mentioned often, when we describe it, so the news that YouTube acquires it was without much interest, a classic example of a well-established technology companies выкупающей potential competitor.</seg>
<seg id="10">It's a mystery why deal with YouTube failed, given that, reportedly, he was ready to pay, no less than Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="11">All that we have at the moment is a statement from Shire CEO Emmett it: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term objectives, and they want to help us reach them more quickly."</seg>
<seg id="12">Another mystery, frankly speaking, this is an incredible success it is.</seg>

<seg id="15">All of the games that you could watch right now.</seg>

<seg id="21">How Amazon works on this?</seg>
<seg id="22">It is hard to imagine that it свернется in Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube would simply absorb it.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, it is with great pleasure that would have received any company: The crowd of young men, of whom dream of advertisers.</seg>

<seg id="2">In view of the fact that the cost of university textbooks for many students more than $1000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move to the second course, came up with an ingenious way to reduce costs.</seg>
<seg id="3">He developed a system of how to take the books in the world, offering them старшекурсников rated compensation that they delayed their sale.</seg>
<seg id="4">"My textbook on mathematical analysis, which typically costs $180 for a semester, I got $10 and biscuits" Chick-fil-A "," says Schroeder, 19, who is studying in Ковенант College in Georgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">The literature on the cost would be $430 last semester, he said.</seg>
<seg id="6">He spent $120.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the Council of the colleges, the average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and educational supplies, however, students have a range of options to reduce these costs.</seg>
<seg id="8">Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas, such as Schroeder system.</seg>
<seg id="9">Rent books is becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book for the semester, and often costing substantially cheaper than buying them.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Нибо Инкорпорейтид", which holds more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of rental books grew by half since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="11">Industry studies show that about a quarter of books in university bookstores during the past spring semester were taken, said the vice president "Нибо" Trevor Meyer.</seg>
<seg id="12">Less than half of all books sold in university bookstores, according to the National Association of the university's professional union shops. "</seg>
<seg id="13">Here's introductory course on the best ways to make profitable deal.</seg>
<seg id="14">Buying online store</seg>
<seg id="15">Sometimes, if you'll come out with a new book on the Internet, the cost could be one-third of that, what you will see in the university bookshop.</seg>
<seg id="16">The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis," Ron this, Bruce Edwards and Robert Хостетлера worth about $290 on privately, but a copy can be purchased for $239,99 site Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Buying подержанного</seg>
<seg id="18">If you don't mind other people's notes or damage, second-hand textbooks are a good option.</seg>
<seg id="19">"Mathematical analysis" sold for $93,49 подержанном form on to Chegg.com.</seg>
<seg id="20">Matt Кэсэдей, 25 years later, a fourth year student at the University of Бригэм Young, said that paid 42 cents on Amazon.com, for instance textbook in strategic decisions in the media: An understanding of the business side of the advertising business. "</seg>
<seg id="21">The book sold for $48.</seg>
<seg id="22">Teachers, for instance, Ingrid Брейси, director of "College without walls" at the University of Massachusetts in Эмхерсте, offers to students with their professors, could benefit from previous editions.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sometimes the updates are insignificant for lessons.</seg>
<seg id="24">In such cases, the old editions can often be found behind a very small fraction of the cost of the latest edition.</seg>
<seg id="25">In addition to the websites of Amazon and Chegg, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., "" - a popular alternative for buying second-hand books.</seg>
<seg id="26">Hire</seg>
<seg id="27">How to take textbooks, you need to think, if you're well enough with them, don't forget to return them and don't want to leave them yourself after the course.</seg>
<seg id="28">You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.</seg>
<seg id="29">For example, a student could rent a "Математический analysis" for a semester for about $20.</seg>
<seg id="30">Find out the rules before the store, where you take the books, including any fines that you can write for markings, underscore and damage.</seg>
<seg id="31">If you take a book rental, remember: If you don't give the book, fines may even exceed the cost of the new instance.</seg>
<seg id="32">Electronic books</seg>
<seg id="33">Electronic books instead of traditional textbooks is another option.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sometimes such books actually take a purchasing electronic license for a certain period for retailers, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Mathematical Analysis" rental site Chegg.com for six months will cost approximately $61.</seg>
<seg id="36">Брейси says that students who study literature, can often find the most advantageous prices, as many of the classics now you can download for free, while the literature on natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.</seg>
<seg id="37">Despite everything, осмотритесь.</seg>
<seg id="38">Joe hippocampus, 29 years old, which is going to begin studies at the Law School Пеппердин, recommends use ISBN numbers to find out prices for the book, because it ensures that you are looking for precisely the right you text.</seg>
<seg id="39">But before you order online, says the hippocampus, be sure to check whether a book is in stock.</seg>
<seg id="40">To him this lesson Hemsedal is not easy.</seg>
<seg id="41">The delivery of the books, which he has acquired was postponed for four weeks, and, in the end, he paid the full price at the university bookshop.</seg>

<seg id="39">Санкционное menu</seg>
<seg id="40">On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree applying specific economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which is basically food sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="41">The country banned import of beef, pork, a by-product from meat and poultry, meat, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cheese, cheese, vegetables, fruit, nuts, sausage and sugar syrups.</seg>
<seg id="42">Restaurants have started чехарда with suppliers: Prices of products grown, you must urgently seek counterparts from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="43">This will affect the most expensive restaurants with монокухней France, Italy, Spain, in which products supplied directly from "motherships" countries.</seg>
<seg id="44">Общепиту was carrying earlier.</seg>
<seg id="45">For example, when, at the beginning of 2014, the Rosselkhoznadzor forbade the importation of Australian beef, and the year before - the American and Canadian meat.</seg>
<seg id="46">In return, the suppliers we have supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="47">But sanctions лета-2014 proved to be far more serious.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which lifted the ban on Atlantic salmon and trout fry безлактозное seed potatoes, milk, sugar, corn, peas and onions for replanting.</seg>
<seg id="49">The Italian phone hopes that sanctions might still смягчиться.</seg>
<seg id="50">As long as uncertainty exists in most restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="51">According to the company "East-West", one of the largest suppliers of imported products in the HoReCa premium segment accounted for up to 70%.</seg>
<seg id="52">"Expensive restaurants may change menus under the produce of local farmers and other countries," says Sergei Mironov, Resurrection, owner of the agency "Рестконсалт."</seg>
<seg id="53">If the strong, for him it's not going to be a problem.</seg>
<seg id="54">But we have very little of these cooks, and the development of new menu items may take two to three months.</seg>
<seg id="55">Тригель Brasserie restaurant from "The Bridge" prepared: Refuse to pay 10-15%, still half the menu, recycle.</seg>
<seg id="56">In restaurants with a mixed kitchen are starting to replace dishes, for example steak from marble beef - on бефстроганов, says Sergei Mironov.</seg>
<seg id="57">"Cheeses from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian cheeses and cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile," lists the "East-West" Oksana Глибчук.</seg>
<seg id="58">Cream and milk products from Europe have counterparts in Russia and Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="59">Chicken from the United States may be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and Queensway from Norway - salmon, семгой, interest from Belarus and Chile.</seg>
<seg id="60">The absence of vegetables and fruits of European production may be at the expense of domestic production, proposals from Serbia, Moldova and China.</seg>
<seg id="61">According to Mironov, budgetary network restaurants re-build will be easier than премиальному segment: Hardly there went to 16-year-old Italian mozzarella is able to distinguish from the Russian.</seg>
<seg id="62">Although it is difficult to have institutions Ginza Project, he says.</seg>
<seg id="63">In Ginza Project several dozen restaurants under different brands and with their menu.</seg>
<seg id="64">The replacement leaves plenty of time, "said Mironov.</seg>

<seg id="66">The owners of cafés, Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine stress that products from the former Soviet republics ароматнее European</seg>
<seg id="67">But many restaurants, which sanctions almost never affected.</seg>
<seg id="68">These include schools with kitchen CIS: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.</seg>
<seg id="69">"The Georgian kitchen no expensive products," says Хатуна Колбая Saperavi, owner of Georgian restaurants and cafes "Vai мэ!."</seg>
<seg id="70">All cheeses for us to do in Russia, the basis of many dishes - chicken, exotic herbs we don't use. "</seg>
<seg id="71">In Колбаи establishments not yet removed from the menu of a single cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="72">Timur effective, owner of the restaurants "Чайхона N1" with Uzbek cuisine, sanctions also might alert: He will have to change not only the Norwegian in New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="73">If Russia our owned imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we even win in price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="74">From the CIS can be cheaper to get engineering, Norwegian, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruit.</seg>
<seg id="75">While that brought from Central Asia, far better than "plastics" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="76">About Uzbek tomatoes all know that they are tasty, sweet.</seg>
<seg id="77">The Spanish one doesn't say so.</seg>
<seg id="78">After the sanctions all Uzbekistan Олимбой Артыков spokesman, said that plans to increase export плодовоовощной products to Russia in half by 2016.</seg>
<seg id="79">Of its intention to replace the European imports in Russia almost immediately after the sanctions said Belarus and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="80">Restaurants now that responded to the query "Money," and also quite calmly respond to sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="81">McDonald's press service said that localization exceeds 85 per cent, and the network is working with 160 Russian suppliers.</seg>
<seg id="82">According to Tatyana Богдановой, head of the department for work with suppliers building, about 80% of the food network buys in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with supplies of vegetables and increased prices for meat products that produce from the imported raw materials.</seg>
<seg id="83">In "Теремке санкционные" foods "generally have no more than 4%.</seg>
<seg id="84">Not affected by sanctions and лапшичную Воккер "."</seg>
<seg id="85">KFC, Burger King and "Крошка Картошка" on request "Money" did not reply, but other market participants said that the degree of localization of Burger King is substantially less than the McDonald's.</seg>

<seg id="87">At its горбуше</seg>
<seg id="88">And as far as the restaurant operators complain that because of increasing demand, prices are rising even on local foods.</seg>
<seg id="89">"On products for" sticking points "prices increased on average by 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant" Cherry M & E "- twice," says Resurrection Roman Рожниковский.</seg>
<seg id="90">Even at the cost of Georgian restaurants to increase by 5-10%, concedes Колбая.</seg>
<seg id="91">"East-West" denies this: "For example, the Belarusian milk products since August lowest by 10-15 percent."</seg>
<seg id="92">"Brazilian suppliers raised prices for pork nearly twice," complains, Deputy General Director Sergei Cancer "Стардогс."</seg>
<seg id="93">Chicken legs rose by 35%.</seg>
<seg id="94">Expect prices from China, maybe they остудят hot Brazilian head.</seg>
<seg id="95">In the near future in "Стардогсе" will be planned to increase prices by 8%.</seg>
<seg id="96">Now, and so very undesirable to raise prices, "says Cancer.</seg>
<seg id="97">According to statistics, catering revenue growth for the second quarter of 2014, just 1.8%.</seg>
<seg id="98">This is the smallest rate since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="99">Retail prices will rise further, he admits, but it is unclear how quickly: While most work запаслось products over the next two months, hoping to wait out their purchase prices.</seg>

<seg id="110">We are catching it and нерку горбушу чавычу, "royal salmon."</seg>
<seg id="111">Yes, they are not as fat as the Norwegian salmon, because it is wild fish.</seg>
<seg id="112">Norwegian salmon is the same aquaculture.</seg>

<seg id="117">Galkin is confident that it is time to move on fish from the Far East.</seg>
<seg id="118">According to statistics, fishing in Russia in 2013 - more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="119">Imports of fish 2013-м - about 800,000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="120">Shop "his people" working in 2012, sells fish through the retailer before the sanctions still operates a dozen restaurants, such as "Simple and easy things."</seg>
<seg id="121">Now the application received from another Галкину 15 restaurants.</seg>

<seg id="123">We заморочились, tried various recipes.</seg>
<seg id="124">Now sushi sell through online retailer per million rubles a month.</seg>

<seg id="126">In evidence in a tent right I prepare a portion of "Philadelphia" with кетой.</seg>
<seg id="127">Unlike rolls with семгой these accounts for longer chew, but consciousness that this fish, native to our forces.</seg>

<seg id="129">In суши-барах, however, replace the Norwegian salmon prefer Chilean.</seg>
<seg id="130">Galkin explains that поварам laziness inventing new recipes with the Far East fish.</seg>
<seg id="131">"The Russian fish suppliers we have not yet offered an explanation," gives its owner Killfish Bar Dmitri Evseev.</seg>
<seg id="132">About the same situation with other products: Russian producers could take the vacant niche, but this does not happen.</seg>
<seg id="133">According to the founder and co-owner of Boris Акимова LavkaLavka project, now we can talk about rather than the imports from Europe and America imports from China, Israel and Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="134">There are large multinational corporations, which have a powerful logistics and large volumes.</seg>
<seg id="135">They can quickly replace blocked imports, in contrast to our farmers.</seg>
<seg id="136">The ban will benefit from the first major producers in other countries, "says Akimov.</seg>
<seg id="137">However, in the past month ресторанная industry received more alarming than food sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="138">According to the results of the audits of supplementary Rospotrebnadzor was temporarily suspended operations of three McDonald's in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg.</seg>

<seg id="140">No one really knows what will happen next.</seg>
<seg id="141">If everyone limited food sanctions, this is one way that you can survive, "he said on condition of anonymity, a company employee ресторанным consulting.</seg>

<seg id="9">Parameters laid out in the draft guidelines that are designed to eliminate this obstacle to implementing "европротокола" in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="10">According to them, the maximum payout has been in connection with the accident, without the police, must not be lower than the limit for "европротоколу."</seg>
<seg id="11">But she can't be above a certain limit, the treaty has insurance.</seg>
<seg id="12">The idea, of course, useful and theoretically capable of relieving both Smith and roads.</seg>
<seg id="13">But, more likely, it will not come to the delight of neither motorists nor insurers.</seg>
<seg id="14">The last now talk about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which could lead to the introduction of new rules on payments has been.</seg>
<seg id="15">As for the drivers, it is difficult to imagine what kind of work will have to be done to overcome исконный Russian conservatism.</seg>
<seg id="16">In most cases, the driver would be hours to wait for the inspectors to arrange small accident, because the more robust.</seg>
<seg id="17">And we still do not know what will be simpler - beat swindlers or convince drivers in reliability "европротокола."</seg>
<seg id="18">Savings certificate will be registered and irrevocable offer</seg>
<seg id="19">The Finance Ministry wants to block savings certificates to the bearer, but will allow banks to make their analogue безотзывного contribution.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Finance Ministry is preparing a bill that would prohibit savings certificates to the bearer.</seg>
<seg id="21">Lately, this tool is gaining popularity, as rates here are higher than on bank deposits.</seg>
<seg id="22">The fact that savings certificates to the bearer not the bank deposit insurance system, and they are cheaper because they don't have to make payments to the Fund Deposit Insurance Agency (DIA).</seg>
<seg id="23">Successfully situation in the fact that this step is planned to be taken for small and medium-sized banks, spreading such certificates, and suffer from Sberbank and Bank of Moscow, which is estimated to control 98% of the DIA, areas of the market.</seg>
<seg id="24">With the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, which is about 3.5%.</seg>
<seg id="25">The problem, explains in the DIA, lies in the fact that a small bank customers who bought such a certificate, in case of withdrawal of his licence is trying to get money in the DIA.</seg>
<seg id="26">Some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates to the bearer, may assume that their investment is insured.</seg>
<seg id="27">Reasonable lack of insurance payments on these сертификатам license revocation in case the bank can lead to misunderstandings and social tension.</seg>
<seg id="28">In practice, agencies were cases when holders предъявительских certificates were trying to rescue the insurance compensation through the courts, "the DIA said.</seg>
<seg id="29">The problem, of course, made-up.</seg>
<seg id="30">After all, paying customers certificates still nobody will, because under the law they have no right to compensation from the State.</seg>
<seg id="31">If the case was that the tool is not insured at DIA, together with him and would have banned metal accounts, which means citizens are taken into consideration in grams of one of four metals: Gold, silver, platinum and palladium.</seg>
<seg id="32">Since these accounts do not fall into a system of deposit insurance, but their existence until nobody deprives.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is likely that the bearer certificates are a very convenient valuable paper that actually can act in the role of квазиденег.</seg>
<seg id="34">With almost no control of their movement: Any bank customer can buy a certificate to every citizen, and to putting this certificate can change a lot of people.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is no coincidence that the draft that savings certificate must be issued more paper, which must be stored in depositories.</seg>
<seg id="36">But banks, continues to issue such certificates shall be allowed without the right of early repayment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Then you have introduced similar безотзывного contribution, which has long been a dream of the bankers.</seg>

<seg id="1">They met the two Union</seg>
<seg id="2">The talks at the highest level in Minsk is not decided, for the sake of the problems which were called back, but has also produced a new format: The first face of the European Union met with the chief executives of the Eurasian future</seg>
<seg id="3">Let тревожному and the situation around Ukraine very urgent about (not), the Customs Union and for the first time EU leaders discussed several "hot issues."</seg>
<seg id="4">It is capable of such a structure to work effectively, it is unclear; but it is clear who took the cream from that summit.</seg>
<seg id="5">Questions on this score fell away in the evening on August 26, when the Belarusians, and after them and other евразийцы with Europeans saw a television news report about the new President Lukashenko.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Belarusian leader revealed an example of polished talent, it was the behavior of a man who had just caught the jackpot - and is planning a decent old age in high society.</seg>
<seg id="7">As Maidan Lukashenko helped</seg>
<seg id="8">Arrival in Minsk just three major European commissioners (of EU ministers), who met with Mr. Lukashenko and allowed him to perform at the final briefing on their behalf -- not just легитимация president for the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">This is an application for recognition of a full-fledged subject of European policy, and a major campaign of the Ukrainian crisis.</seg>
<seg id="10">A senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Studies Denis Мельянцов sure: From now on, Brussels can't already speak with Minsk in the same tone as before.</seg>
<seg id="11">"What Catherine Ashton met face to face with Lukashenko, gives reason to believe that the relationship with the EU will be размораживаться and beyond," he said "Огоньку."</seg>
<seg id="12">This is the tip of the iceberg: Preparing to push a hidden part of the Belarusian authorities began long before November Maidan in Kiev - summer 2013-го.</seg>
<seg id="13">"The results were achieved and the EU is the successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues about modernization," lists interlocutor Ogonyok which had been famous for - and with the United States have held talks on international security.</seg>
<seg id="14">States even took a little bit of sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="15">As regards the Ukrainian events, then they themselves and response to Belarus only invoked another influx of this process.</seg>
<seg id="16">Minsk, on the one hand, managed to preserve relations with Ukraine are fairly warm, so not much to lose in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for talks.</seg>
<seg id="17">On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who admitted not de jure joining of Crimea to Russia and has urged to punish pro-Russian militia in the Donbas with all severity, not quarreled with Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="18">Minsk has not released any of the Customs Union, nor from the Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO), which is placed in a Russian air base.</seg>
<seg id="19">Brussels and Washington have noticed a balanced position of Minsk to the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated her confident Belarusian experts.</seg>
<seg id="20">How successful will the movement's political diversification, will be seen by how often in the near future, the meeting in Minsk should accept EU format + TC.</seg>
<seg id="21">The press office of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy Catherine Ashton and diplomacy have failed to answer questions about what Brussels wants from the relationship in a new format.</seg>
<seg id="22">A spokesman for Ashton said only "Mayan Косьянчич Огоньку" that decisions on issues of war and peace, this issue is not a priority.</seg>
<seg id="23">While there were reports that following a meeting on the Ukraine issue, with the participation of the people in the new format may be, and Kazakhstan.</seg>
<seg id="24">A drop of tar in Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that about him, it turns out, personally asked the representatives of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="25">Nevertheless, at the final briefing Alexander Lukashenko made it clear: All parties opposed to the Minsk remained a central platform for meeting both Россия--ОБСЕ--Украина format, and at the level of Heads of State and high representatives of the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="26">This means that "the last dictator in Europe" рукопожатного acquires the status of a European leader who helps solve a global problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">Farmer's best friend</seg>
<seg id="28">The EU delegation included еврокомиссаров on trade and energy, pushed to the conclusion: The main underlying reason for the summit -- not the tragic situation in the Donbas, and economy.</seg>
<seg id="29">In fact, сверстанное meeting schedule future talks on the gas supply and to overcome fear of the CU in the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU looks achievement more extensive than peace declaration without specific dates and numbers.</seg>
<seg id="30">Trade Commissioner Karl De Гюхт, nevertheless, indicates: EU officials "arrived in Minsk seek solution to the political crisis which has economic consequences, and not vice versa."</seg>
<seg id="31">It seems, however, that the economy and the crisis in Ukraine "works" in Belarus.</seg>
<seg id="32">Its consequences - and above all reciprocal sanctions from the West and Russia, offer cut-price, who until he feels санкционное pressure, with room for maneuver.</seg>
<seg id="33">According to the leader of the Mises Research Centre, Belarus Yaroslav Ramanchuk, European investors are actively interested in opportunities for supplies of agricultural products to Russia in bypassing sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="34">The supply of such schemes, for which President Vladimir Putin at the summit пожурил Minsk.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Billions of these schemes," said Romanchuk Огоньку "," are not the Belarusian businessmen and Russian companies.</seg>
<seg id="36">They had long practised scheme of supplies of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="37">Russian business badly needs to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.</seg>
<seg id="38">The second story, "the expert continues," is linked to the fact that many Ukrainian companies not away to Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials as well as focusing on the Russian market.</seg>
<seg id="39">Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and the Belarusian производственно-торговые schemes now would be very popular. "</seg>
<seg id="40">According to Ramanchuk, the role of the host venue for the talks, the EU and the TC is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of the development of economic ties with Europe.</seg>
<seg id="41">He recalls that the loss of the agricultural sector of the EU sanctions against Moscow are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the Commission is currently proposed 5.45 only 125 million euros in compensation.</seg>
<seg id="42">The Belarusian president may offer to Brussels to work together to minimise the consequences for еврофермеров.</seg>
<seg id="43">This could raise the authority of Lukashenko to the EU to unprecedented heights.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hospitality without initiatives</seg>
<seg id="45">Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative for the summit.</seg>
<seg id="46">But the paradox is that the Minsk from his active role in the birth of the CU + EU открещивается format, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with Ukrainian counterpart emphasized that the initiator of a new format and it was Kiev.</seg>
<seg id="47">"It was your suggestion to come, without any навала discuss, not with бухты-барахты decide, after signing the Association Agreement with the EU, to understand the situation, which at that time was in Ukraine," he remonstrated before the cameras to Peter Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="48">However, observers interpreted it as an attempt to reassure Moscow, it is rumoured, was initially against the intermediation of Minsk, which greatly increases its political weight.</seg>
<seg id="49">In Belarusian diplomatic establishment diligently stress that Belarus when the interaction between the EU and the organization on its soil does not pursue goals, and the ultimate goal of this format is to create in the future, a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.</seg>
<seg id="50">"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts which, in other fields, in particular in the field of security, puts and promotes the leadership of our strategic ally, the Russian Federation," the Foreign Ministry said "Огоньку" in Belarus, where a recent words were chosen very carefully.</seg>

<seg id="1">Putin demands from Kiev to start negotiations on the "statehood" of eastern Ukraine</seg>
<seg id="2">According to Russian news reports about his comments, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government has stopped fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately started negotiations on the "statehood" отделившегося region.</seg>
<seg id="3">His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later discloses that Putin had in mind the hint that восточноукраинская territory controlled by separatists will become part of Russia, but that we need to reconsider its status within Ukraine, to give русскоговорящему region to protect their rights and interests.</seg>
<seg id="4">However, Mr Putin's call for the Government to start negotiations with the very insurgents as equal in the government-controlled with an obvious strategy, which he follows from the start of the bloodshed five months ago: To help rebels take territory and force the Ukrainian government give новопровозглашенной Новороссии of de facto independence, to closer ties with Russia rather than with the West.</seg>
<seg id="5">In an interview with state television, Uluru, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return retained in the eastern separatists in Luhansk and the Donetsk regions that were seized in March and April, after Moscow аннексировала Ukrainian peninsula Crimea on March 18.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Kremlin and the separatists recently named Новороссией captured territory, or New Russia, the name, which refers to the дореволюционным days of glory of the Russian Empire.</seg>
<seg id="7">Putin said that anyone who believes that the peace talks will occur in the near future, when the Ukrainian politicians to campaign for parliamentary elections on October 26, and while government troops attack peaceful settlements of the separatist held regions - "illusions," Itar-Tass reported's a prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="8">"We must immediately begin substantive talks and not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the public status of Southeast Ukraine, in order to serve the interests of the people living there," he said.</seg>
<seg id="9">Peskov said that Putin's words about statehood had in mind in the context of the broader autonomy that was discussed during months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to allay fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and language rights at risk.</seg>
<seg id="10">Only the Ukrainian government can give the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions, "Peskov said.</seg>
<seg id="11">It is not a matter for discussion between Russia and Ukraine, Peskov said, "because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and an internal Ukrainian conflict."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Kremlin's press secretary, to rectify an "incorrect interpretation of the words" Putin stressed the decision of the Russian leadership to behave towards the breakaway rebellion in the east in any other way than to open the seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the population is ethnic Russians 2-миллионного.</seg>
<seg id="13">Moscow would have had to withstand much more heavy battle to join even the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine and Луганскую, since most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian, and surveys prior to the start of the conflict, showed broad support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.</seg>
<seg id="14">Autonomy, which Russian diplomats discussed at international forums gave regional governments in the Ukraine power themselves to trade agreements and foreign policy, essentially giving the Kremlin a de facto control of the territory, which would be combined with the situation in the territory of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="15">Located on the Black Sea peninsula, присоединенном five months ago, is still the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial marine institutions and historical sea resorts.</seg>
<seg id="16">In regions between Russia's Rostov region and the situation also are mines, mills and casting plants that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.</seg>
<seg id="17">Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed in his inaugural address June 7, to Ukrainian lawmakers after new elections взвесили amendments to the constitution to give отделившимся regions greater control of their finances and the status of languages.</seg>
<seg id="18">However, his opinion to autonomy, it seems, is very different from the view of the Kremlin and повстанцев-сепаратистов Burny, which accuse Moscow of aiding and abetting.</seg>
<seg id="19">Last call for Putin to Kiev to negotiate with the leaders of the separatists, as with equal, followed by new наступлениями rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks rolled into previously peaceful areas of eastern Ukraine along the Azov Sea.</seg>
<seg id="20">Supported by Russia, the separatists took control of the city, the occurrence of which Новоазовск officers of the Ukrainian security services say they are afraid that he is starting a campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory to the Crimea.</seg>
<seg id="21">This led to a large-scale civilian and military efforts to strengthen when the port of Mariupol, with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Новоазовском Hopefully and narrow on the Crimean peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="22">Poroshenko on Saturday addressed the meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, the former Soviet republic, which has been independent for 23 years.</seg>
<seg id="23">"We are approaching a point of No Return," warned Poroshenko.</seg>
<seg id="24">Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukrainian territory.</seg>
<seg id="25">EU summit had not taken certain measures; leaders urged to draw up a project more harsh sanctions against Russia, which will be taken in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.</seg>

<seg id="1">The anger was the most versatile and functional human emotion</seg>
<seg id="2">Сердитое expression is biologically universal for mankind, and everyone involved in its creation of a body and the muscle is not fortuitous, but an additional means of expressing power and threat, researchers have found in Australia and the US.</seg>
<seg id="3">About their discovery, they reported in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly about them can be found in a press release, the University of California in Santa Barbara.</seg>
<seg id="4">Гневное expression - joined by climbing in and down at the thin line of eyebrows, lips, and nostrils -- an equally in all cultures, and make it even blind from birth children, never, "says lead author of the study who had seen Aaron Селл.</seg>
<seg id="5">As part of a major research project on the nature of the anger, the scientists found that arose this emotion for the effective conduct of disputes during the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="6">The more physical damage one man can do to another, the greater the opportunity to dictate to him, while he pleads to partner with anger.</seg>
<seg id="7">The researchers have confirmed their hypothesis: Physically and other powerful people often get angry or get to pitch invasions, consider themselves entitled to impose other disadvantageous conditions for them, as well as the preferred methods of solving conflicts by peaceful means.</seg>
<seg id="8">Starting from that anger is a bargaining emotion, "first and foremost," the scientists decided that movements of each of the seven groups of muscles, facial expressions, creating сердитое гневающегося should represent the individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the other person -- and thereby force as soon as possible to agree to its terms in order to avoid conflict.</seg>
<seg id="9">To test this hypothesis, the researchers modelled on a computer, where a provisional Constitution, had or was absent, each of the seven items гневного faces, and showed them информантам.</seg>
<seg id="10">Although forward enthusiastically by climbing in eyebrow or chin individually do face evil, then изображенного human traits with stronger physically, study participants acknowledged unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="11">Anger as human, and with animals, expresses a threat: An exaggerated manifestation of his own forces, the reaffirmation to agree and to obey.</seg>
<seg id="12">Man поджимает inflated nostrils and lips with the same goal, and that frog, which надувается бабуин, or who demonstrates his fangs.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Anger" runs "refusal to accept the situation, and the other person's face immediately takes the form, effectively has demonstrated the opposite side of the consequences of this failure.</seg>
<seg id="14">But most striking is that none of the components гневного faces is not arbitrary, they are one and the same, "said anthropologist John Туби.</seg>
