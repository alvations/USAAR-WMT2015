scientists have found a way to detect familial stars 
Astrophysics at the University of California at Santa Cruz have studied турбулентное stirring and its impact on the chemical homogeneity in stellar flocks . 
it is expected that the experts will search among the stars , family , that is arising from one of the cluster . 
the results of their research , the authors have published in the journal Nature , and briefly with them can be found on the website of the University . 
the cause of the same chemical composition близлежайших stars is турбулентное stirring in the clouds of gas that existed before the formation of the stars . 
even if born star then leaves the stellar cluster , its chemical composition can determine place of her birth and region education звезд-родственников . 
previously , scientists have had doubts that the evolution of the stars outside a cluster may lead to differences in its chemical content from such have relatives in the cluster . 
the simulation results conducted астрофизиками , show that such differences should not appear . 
in this study , specialists using суперкомпьютера modelled two streams of interstellar gas , which together formed a cloud . 
this object within a few million years under their own gravity into a cluster , where they form протозвезды . 
the scientists added краски-метки in initial gas flows and determined that thanks to rapid турбулентному перемешиванию in the cloud is achieved a high degree of chemical homogeneity . 
as astrophysics , their research proves that you can look for звезды-родственники on chemical composition , as well as identify potential regions of these objects .

recalling a very American ideal that labor rights are human rights 
congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have offered the bill , on which the trade unions is a civil right . 
&quot; where trade unions that are there and the jobs of the middle class , &quot; says Ellison , Democrat of Minnesota , who is the co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive factions . 
that &apos;s why I proudly represent Act expanding workers &apos; rights , together with the symbol of the movement for civil rights by John Lewis . 
this bill will give workers the same legal possibilities for discrimination against organizations , trade unions , and other forms of discrimination , bringing to power foes of trade unions 
changing the law on regulation of labour relations in such a way as to allow the workers encountering discrimination for participating in organizations , trade unions , to seek justice in the civil courts &quot; and to receive compensation for damages and punitive payments - a sensible and necessary initiative . 
but it &apos;s certainly not radical initiative - at least by American standards . 
in fact , the best way to understand the fact that offer Ellison , Lewis and co-authors of the bill , &quot; recall is a very American idea . 
despite the attacks , which the unions have been subjected in recent years - in Wisconsin , Michigan and other states across the country , Americans once supported countries around the world to adopt , to expand and to respect human rights . 
there was a time , which is still remembered by millions of Americans , when this country simultaneously defend democracy , freedom of speech , freedom of the press and the right to organize . 
when the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War , General Douglas MacArthur and his assistants have helped the country to adopt a constitution , so as to ensure that balanced state autocracy Хидеки Тодзё was replaced by democracy . 
fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan , they included text that explicitly admitted that &quot; the right of workers to organize and to negotiate , and for collective action is guaranteed . &quot; 
when the United States occupied Germany after World War II , General Dwight David Эйзенхауер and his assistants have helped the Germans to write a constitution that guaranteed that the fascism of Adolf Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy . 
recognizing that workers will need to be organized and be heard in the new state , the Germans have included an article that openly stated : &quot; right to form associations with the aim to protect and improve employment and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or field of activity . 
agreements that restrict or seek to diminish that right , will have no legal force ; measures to these objectives will be deemed illegal . 
when former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt was president of the International Commission on Human Rights , which was World Declaration on Human Rights , which in 1948 , will be adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement , Roosevelt and the added that &quot; everyone has the right to organize and join unions to protect their interests . &quot; 
generations of Americans take for granted our basic position that labor rights are human rights . 
when this country was advised by other countries about how to create a civil and democratic society , Americans have explained that the right to organize labor unions - and the fact that this union has participated as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies - should be protected . 
now , when these rights are under assault in America , wise , indeed , return to the American ideal of what working people should have the right to organize and to ensure that their voices were heard in a free and open society . 
as the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago : 
history is a great teacher . 
now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the forces of the nation , but increased them . 
raising the living standards of millions , unions miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to fragile level of production . 
those who attack the unions , forget these simple truths , but history remembers them . 
history remembers should and to us . 
official recognition of labour rights as human rights and the protection of civil rights , to prevent discrimination against organizations , trade unions , was long overdue . 
Keith Ellison and John Lewis Ukraine ideals , which historically have expanded America and made a promise of democracy a reality . 
judge temporarily blocks law that could close all абортные clinics in Louisiana 
in the U.S. , a federal judge on Sunday temporarily has blocked the enactment of the law in Louisiana , which his supporters say he likely will close all five абортных clinics in the state . 
according to this measure , which was signed by the Governor of Louisiana Bobby Джинадлом in June and was supposed to go into effect September 1 , doctors who do abortions , were obliged to have showing a radius of 30 miles of their practice . 
nevertheless , the judge &apos;s decision means that , at present , doctors can continue to make legal abortion , while continuing to seek such powers . 
&quot; the plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally , continuing actions to gain power , &quot; he wrote in his decision , Judge John деГрэвеллз . 
a hearing will be scheduled within the next month , at which a judge will take a more permanent solution on this law . 
the defenders of the right to abortion with joy were met by this decision , the latest in a chain of decisions against similar measures , saying it will give doctors more time to receive hospital authority . 
&quot; today &apos;s decision ensures that the women of Louisiana will be protected from one law which seeks to deprive them of the health and human rights , &quot; said Nancy Нортап , president and head of the Center for reproductive Rights , which filed a lawsuit to stop the law on behalf of three of the five clinics . 
it was not immediately clear whether the decision to the doctors from two clinics that do not give claimants in the case , and also filed an application for the admission . 
Louisiana is one of the 11 states that have adopted similar laws , and the courts recently acknowledged such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi . 
key parts of texas law , which closed would have the majority of the remaining clinics in this state , were blocked by a federal judge on Friday . 
fighters for the right to abortion , along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the American Medical Association say that the laws on the powers of impose on doctors , restrictions are not necessary from the medical point of view . 
opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women &apos;s health , though some also pointed to positive effect in the closing clinics . 
only one doctor who does abortions in Louisiana , there are powers of the reception in the hospital , according to the Center for reproductive Rights . 
if all the other doctors in the state will be forced to stop performing the procedure , the doctor , fearing for their safety , could no longer perform the procedure , told the group . 
criticizing the decision , officials in Louisiana said that will not punish doctors doing abortions as long as their statements on the reception awaiting decisions . 
what will the introduction of quotas for domestic products 
not less than half of products for each type of product in the range trading networks should be the Russian production , says Duma deputy from A Just Russia , Oleg Nilov has informed about . 
the MP has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures for domestic manufacturers , writes the newspaper Izvestia . 
the document will still детализироваться , in order to avoid possible discomfort for buyers . 
this applies to goods that are produced in Russia . &lt; ... &gt; According to the rest of the groups of products , which are produced in Russia , Vester will provide at least half of their shelves to domestic producers , &quot; Nilov has informed about publication . 
together with the amendments , in the article &quot; On the basis of state regulation of trading activities in the Russian Federation , &quot; the bill provides for the introduction of changes to the Tax Code , laying down religious rate VAT 10 % for products produced in Russia . 
the idea to introduce a 50 % -процентную quota in retail networks included in the stimulus package for Russian producers . 
the shop appears several times more than domestic goods . 
however , the initiative may have both positive and negative effects , experts say . 
according to the lawyer the company &quot; Налоговик &quot; , a member of an independent expert center &quot; Public Duma Sergei Litvinenko for the Russian economy , as well as for domestic agricultural and food industries , the effect will be positive in nature , and will lead to growth . 
the advantage will be key , farmers , and small shops . 
they will be able to sell more , and that means that profits will grow . 
in addition , they will receive the right to dictate retailers their conditions and prices , because they will be forced to buy their goods . 
Russian manufacturers will be able to increase their business and sales , which would lead to pay higher taxes than before . 
it will increase revenue , create new jobs , any industry will grow any faster in , be made to contribute to the growth of GDP . 
Russia &apos;s dependence on foreign food fall a few times , but not immediately , &quot; said the expert . 
earlier , Russian companies are often unable to fight their way to the shelves of local stores due to higher competition from foreign counterparts . 
now , after the introduction of the embargo , this niche freed and can breathe a sigh of relief . 
but do not forget that after all the necessary approvals and sanitary inspections to the Russian market will come grocery goods from Latin America , Turkey and Serbia . 
in other words , it is now a &quot; moment of calm &quot; when former players have already gone , but new ones yet to come . 
after almost a month , you can talk about four demand for Russian raw materials , as well as rising prices for finished products , &quot; said АиФ.ru first Vice President of Russian public institutions , &quot; the Russian club finance directors &apos; , Tamara Kasyanov . 
clearly , the idea of selling in each category at least 50 per cent of Russian food products will help to consolidate the sector for local producers . 
in that case , they will have to compete with one another , not with products , through subsidies of another State , are cheaper . 
in other words , the fight for customers will unfold between companies , working on a single law industry . 
on the other hand , says Kasyanov , Russian producers are able to meet 50 % of domestic needs compatriots not on all items . 
and in this situation commercial networks will have &quot; дотягивать &quot; share of Russian goods up to half of the range . 
in this regard , increasing fears that the price will come substandard goods . 
perhaps under the guise of manufactured in Russia , will be delivered to foreign products with перебитыми labels , &quot; adds an expert . 
the negative effect of the introduction of quotas will feel the large retail chains , especially those that выгодней cooperate with importers . 
it is logical that the former prime minister will suffer and foreign suppliers , because the demand for their products will decrease . 
Litvinenko did not rule out that the law on quotas on domestic goods may impact on consumers . 
the fact is that some of the products produced in Russia may yield in the quality of imported ones , while shops will be boosting prices on the second as a scarce commodity . 
the long-forgotten early in the 2000s , the idea of import substitution economists again spoke in February this year because of the ongoing devaluation of the ruble . 
now , amid the uneasy relations with the West , the question of refusal to the import of products becomes even more urgent . 
the law aims to compel retailers under orders to suppliers reckon with domestic producers . 
then we are much faster and more confident we will go on the path of import substitution , and the planning system of production on necessary types of products will be created in a shorter period of time , &quot; says the MP Oleg Nilov has informed about . 
especially effective mechanism of quotas will be for the agricultural sector , where the potential is particularly high , for example , in the dairy industry , where the share of imports was 25 % . 
our farmers are able to fully cover the shelves in Russian shops . 
in addition , a powerful impulse can receive and a beautiful production . 
as you know , the biggest share of imports remains on offer - from 30 % to 35 % . 
it turns out that 65-70 per cent are still on Russian products , &quot; says Kasyanov . 
experts are of the opinion that the introduction of quotas for domestic products contribute импортозамещению and can speed up this process . 
but itself to импортозамещению this initiative will not , because it needs a range of measures , I am sure Mr Litvinenko . 
in any case , 50 per cent of sold goods under this initiative can still be brought from abroad and , consequently , full import isn &apos;t going to happen , but significant steps in this direction will be done . 
the same little set quotas , the need to establish production of domestic products to these quotas to meet . 
these quotas just such a guarantee , and will be , &quot; concludes the expert . 
uniting delayed diagnosis , and the lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kill more 
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video in memory of their late mother , who died from ovarian cancer in 2007 . 
women прощивающие in rural Australia , face higher risks of death from ovarian cancer than those living in cities . 
the researchers analyzed maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with &quot; ovarian cancer &quot; in 2005 , finding that only 35 percent have lived five years after he was diagnosed . 
lead researcher Susan Jordan from the Institute of Medical Research QIMR Berghofer reported that the probability of dying during the study by 20 percent higher for those who live in the regions and in remote areas of state than those who live in urban areas . 
a small study : new drugs may slow lung cancer and ovarian cancer 
the researchers tracked the medical way women over seven years . 
Dr Jordan said that the age of the woman at the time of diagnosis , the type of ovarian cancer , and the presence of recurrent disease and социоэкономический status also influenced the likelihood of survival . 
women are older , and the cancer was in the later stages at the moment of diagnosis , had the lowest survival rates . 
for those who live in the regions or remote parts of the state , the chance of dying during the study was 20 percent higher than for those who lived in urban areas . 
although the study was not designed to determine why women who live outside cities are more likely to die from ovarian cancer , Dr. Jordan suggested — delayed diagnosis , and the lack of access to the optimum treatment is possible factors . 
&quot; this disease is best treated surgeons experienced in gynecologic oncology , and they are mainly located in big cities , &quot; she said . 
despite the improvement in the quality of the ITU services , to reduce the impact of distance , she suggested that an increase in the number of services in the field , which will allow professionals to treat women closer to home , and program support to people receiving treatment is far from his home , can help . 
Dr Jordan said that regardless of the geographical position , the study found that prolonged life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare , stressing the need for more effective strategies for treatment and prevention . 
the study , which was funded Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer scientist , will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia . 
in March 2012 , at the age of 33 years , a young mother with Golden shore Элише Neave was told that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer . 
in September the Куженерском area of open doors , a new ФАП

inflation came out of the holiday . 
feel whether Russians soaring prices 
as a result , BNP sanctions of Russia and the West inflation in Russia will not уложится in predictions of the authorities , convinced analysts &quot; VTB Capital . &quot; 
according to experts , the deferred effects антисанкций will lead to inflationary shock in the first quarter of 2015 , writes RBC Daily . 
according to the latest forecast , in 2014 , inflation will be 6,5-7,5 % next year and even less - 6.5 % . 
however , according to the newspaper , &quot; Kommersant , &quot; this week the ministry should make a &quot; small but significant &quot; changes in macroeconomic forecast up to 2017 . 
according to the publication , the agency ’ s assessment of inflation in 2015 , which will eliminate the expected progeSOFT personal income growth . 
the forecast anticipated that food sanctions Russia act a year - until August 2015 . 
in such a situation , you could assume such high inflation ? 
the current situation involves geared shock , but понижательный trend of inflation does not change , &quot; said the source of the newspaper so far . 
economists from , &quot; VTB Capital analysts do not share expectations economic bloc governments regarding inflation and the forecast price growth in 2014 at the level of 8 % . 
the main effect of product bans will come together with the possible introduction of the Spine sales taxes ( GAP ) in 2015 , convinced experts . 
inflationary peak at 9 per cent in February , after which the annual pace of price growth will decline , some experts believe . 
incidentally , last week , Rosstat concluded the first inflation results , after Russia imposed a &quot; neat sanctions . &quot; 
АиФ.ru interviewed experts and found their inflationary expectations . 
Artem Деев , head of research at FC AForex : 
prices have already observed in key segments . 
moreover , when I began to appreciate the socially relevant products , the government has been forced to launch measures of systematic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risk of unjustified price increases in the short term . 
suppliers and retailers already report on a daily basis before regulators that authorities knew exactly who , where and for what reason will trigger an increase in prices . 
key factors for the growth of the consumer price index continues to be tremendous pace of capital flight , and the excessive refinancing the banking sector from the Russian мегарегулятора , internal convert because of the flight of foreign currency , as well as an embargo on the import of food products from the countries that joined the sanctions against Russia . 
if inflationary pressures remained under control , the cost of a basket of a minimum set of products not jumped to 12 per cent in a quarter . 
a ban on the import of food products provoked shock proposals on the internal market and led to the utterly логичному increase the final cost . 
because at this stage we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution , and increase the size of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production , retaliatory sanctions continue to bear the risks to the growth of the inflationary component . 
if you add here yet and fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the national currency , as well as ухудшенными prospects for economic growth , by the end of this year , inflation could exceed 8 % . 
Alexander Разуваев , director of the analytical department &quot; Alpari . &quot; 
in the 1990s , inflation sometimes hit 20-30 per cent per month in zero she was also higher than current levels , another thing that then it is offset by rapid economic growth . 
I think , at the end of the year inflation will be 8-8,5 % .

an external factor associated with sanctions against Russia , while successfully contained , but if there is a further increase of the pressure , first and foremost , for the financial sector - this can lead to certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations , which traditionally occur in purchases of currency to protect their savings . 
it can be assumed that the government , the Central Bank and the Ministry of Finance will mitigate the gradual weakening of the ruble , as market practices and government regulation . 
but the rise in prices begins traditionally after the summer lull , and perhaps this fall will become more pronounced . 
the target level of consumer inflation in Russia at 7.5 % , most likely выстоит , as Russia has another financial savings .

calculation estimates of construction projects in the Russian Federation will be in a new way 
issues of pricing , regulation of the construction industry , as well as problems of connectivity the Federal Antimonopoly Service takes on a special control . 
under FAS created expert advice on the development of competition in the construction sector . 
at its meeting , the head of the management controls utilities , construction , and natural resources FAS Vadim Solovyov said that &quot; today &apos;s calculation estimates of construction sites is absolutely unintelligible . &quot; 
regulatory environment makes pricing opaque and could lead to an unjustified price construction , the FAS . 
and the cost of the construction of state property during the design phase to determine on the basis of the market prices of constructive solutions , instead used today estimated norms and single pricing for technological operations . 
the proposals made in the &quot; road map &quot; and are now under consideration in минстрое . 
&quot; replacing the traditional documentation in construction in the settlements of constructive elements should lead to less corruption in the industry , &quot; explained &quot; RSL &quot; Vadim Solovyov . 
it is now in full обсчитывается every bolt and nut , and not always to everyone to check , so sometimes the unscrupulous construction companies can mid fill &quot; whole tractor . &quot; 
in минстрое with FAS agree . 
&quot; the first developments for the calculation of the value of the constructive elements already have : developed the methodology for the calculation of prices for constructive solutions , budgeting for these indicators , &quot; said &quot; RSL &quot; , head of the department of urban planning and architecture минстроя Elena Zhukova . 
the pilot chose the road construction . 
however , experts believe that the problem is much more serious . 
both told the &quot; RSL &quot; head of a construction company &quot; Профи-инвест Anatoly Демьянко , estimated regulations is long out of date , but another mechanism businesses unless invited . 
&quot; as far as the proposed settlements for the constructive elements , but in practice this is implementable , because the building has often used different technologies , &quot; he said . 
it is no secret that стройрынок developed largely thanks to госзаказу . 
according to the Chairman of the Management Board of the NP &quot; Экспертное community professionals procurement &quot; Catherine Лезиной , today , the state is the most effective customer . 
deputy director of the pharmaceutical industry centre of capital construction , Rosatom Vladimir Malakhov drew attention to the fact that today &apos;s market is nominally divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts , and the company that owns outsourced competence and does not allow for this field of competitors . 
he believes that the creation of a transparent market is only possible when access to contracts will make Turkey from someone &apos;s manager . 
the expert council was asked to form a government in such a way that one and the same performer may not receive more than one contract worth more than $ 1 billion rubles , or several contracts worth more than $ 1 billion . 
in минстрое believe that this approach must be evaluated from the point of view of the business impact , and effectiveness of construction management . 
as explained by Elena Zhukova , in this case , you will need to delegate the function of general contractor that will lead to an increase in the number of customer and budgetary expenditure on its content . 
at the same time , the customer will need to have the knowledge to assess the quality of its contractors , as well as their safety . 
often , in this 1.13 will need to determine who will be responsible for the security of an object as a whole . 
in addition , this approach may result in the outflow of qualified participants in the state in connection with drogerie in receipt of public order for part-time work and a small amount of the contract . 
deputy head экспертно-консультационного Center Institute of Procurement Alexander Евсташенков believes that right now , the government has turned to business to Scor contractor . 
and gave this example : &quot; a participant when completing the application must indicate &quot; specific performance &quot; without specifying the words &quot; or equivalent &quot; , &quot; should &quot; , &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; more , &quot; &quot; less than , &quot; &quot; similar &quot; &quot; or &quot; , &quot; type &quot; , &quot; a similar type , &quot; &quot; lower , &quot; &quot; lower , &quot; &quot; higher , &quot; &quot; can , &quot; &quot; may , &quot; &quot; might , &quot; &quot; earlier &quot; and &quot; not previously , &quot; &quot; higher , &quot; &quot; not allowed &quot; and so on . 
thus , customers often abuse their right to establish requirements for the content of applications of contractors . 
another problem 44-ФЗ , according to Евсташенкова , was the need to assess the application of quality of work through the &quot; paper &quot; proposal . 
when an attendee , really can be assessed only qualified contractors , but not the quality of the work , in which not even began , &quot; said the expert . 
the quality of the works can be assessed only on their acceptance . 
the expert council also was asked to take a margin income from the upper to the lower echelon that disappeared intermediate contractors . 
chairman of the Expert Council , State Secretary , espionage FAS Andrew Цариковский believes that it should not , as responsible for the order should генподрядчик . 
but otherwise , as in the famous репризе Arkady Raikin normalises sleeping : &quot; пуговицам claims there ? . &quot; 
Israeli children returned to school after the war in Gaza 
thousands of Israeli children in areas near Gaza again went to school on Monday after he spent summers in Da &apos;Arias when missiles and mines rain falling on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas , while schools in Gaza remained closed during the how the territory must be after the fighting . 
the school sessions brought a sense of joy and excitement to victims of missiles settlements of southern Israel , however , traces of warfare remained fresh . 
in the southern city of Ashdod employees kindergarten &quot; Пашош &quot; build a rocket , removed traces of debris from walls and &quot; Hello &quot; before the arrival of the students . 
&quot; we are a little bit afraid , but to look to the future , &quot; said Ронит Bart , a resident of Кибуца Saad and former English teacher at his school . 
many of the kids in our neighborhood really needs to return to a quiet life . 
its an 11-year-old daughter , Chagny Bart , said that all of a sudden start going to school &quot; a bit strange &quot; . 
&quot; it was a difficult time , and we don &apos;t seem to get out of their homes , &quot; she said . 
President Реувен Bertolt Brecht famously asked visited deep-running secular-religious divide , which is located near the border with the Gaza Strip to express their support . 
before the cease-fire stopped the war last week , thousands of residents of the border towns , such as Saad , not out on the street or left their homes , going to safer areas further from Gaza to escape the rocket and минометного fire . 
many residents Нахал Oz , villages near the border with the Gaza Strip , where to Palestinian mines was killed around the boy , doubt that they should go back . 
the Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families have still not returned . 
their children were sent to other schools at this time . 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited the school in Sderot , a town on the border with Gaza , which heavily постарадал from Palestinian fire . 
he advised the children carefully studying and said : &quot; we will do everything possible to give you the knowledge and to ensure your safety . &quot; 
Israel and Hamas agreed to unlimited truce last Tuesday . 
the ceasefire agreement immediately ended combat operations , but unresolved were key issues , for example , the requirement of Hamas on withdrawal египто-израильской blockade of Gaza and the reopening of airports and sea ports in the Gaza Strip . 
Israel wants Hamas folded his arms and gave back to the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war . 
it is expected that a new phase of indirect negotiations will begin later this month in Egypt . 
the war killed more than 2,100 Palestinians , three-quarters were civilians , and at least 494 child , according to the Palestinian side and the UN . 
Israel disputes the figures and says that at least half of those killed were militants ; despite this , he has not provided substantive evidence that supports this assertion . 
on the Israeli side were killed 66 soldiers and six civilians , including one Thai worker . 
during the fighting , Hamas and other militants in Gaza launched 4591 unit of missiles and mines on Israeli cities , mostly in the south of the country . 
the Israeli army , meanwhile , has spent more than 5,000 aerial and other attacks . 
as a result of the Israeli attacks have been damaged and destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza , and an estimated 250,000 people have found refuge in more than 100 schools that were converted into shelters . 
due to the fact that tens of thousands of people were still in shelters , and the fighting continued , the officials responsible for education , last week delayed early in the school year . 
&quot; I hope that the school will soon open , so that we can complete our education , as well as children around the world and Jewish children , &quot; said Mohammad Arab , being a boy , who now lives in one of the schools in Gaza . 
according to popular criteria , real estate prices have shown the greatest winter growth for seven years . 
an index value of housing RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic for house prices in Australian capital city grew by 1.1 per cent in August , reported to RP data on Monday . 
this growth has led to an increase in June , July and August to 4.2 percent , a rise over the winter since 2007 . 
annual growth was 10.9 percent , more than twice as exceeding the growth in the 12 months to August 2013 , but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country . 
director of Research , RP Data Tim Lawless said that while Sydney and Melbourne lead the two-level market . 
figures RP Data show that in Sydney house prices grew by 16.1 per cent in the past year , while in Melbourne , at 11.7 percent . 
following the power markets were Adelaide , Брисбейн and Darwin , where prices on average rose from five to six per cent . 
at the other end of the scale was Canberra , which were all over government spending cuts , where prices rose just 1.4 per cent for the year . 
Mr Lawless said that now , when spring , there will be an increase in the number of properties for sale , over the next few months , that would be &quot; a real challenge &quot; for the market . 
&quot; given the current high level of speed auction sales , a high velocity sales and current conditions with a low interest rate , it is likely that the cost of housing is still expected to rise over the next three months , &quot; he said . 
as people live in the old house Ufa 
in the former home of gold and горнозаводчиков Евдокима and his son Ivan Демидова on the street of the October Revolution 57 / 1 ( former Big Kazan ) 18 apartments . 
the house of the 18th century , since the building has not changed , if not considered ветхость . 
people out here , like on the tour , and tenants more suffering than rejoice , from his privilege - the right to live in the 7th Ufa house whose walls recall commander Alexander Suvorov . 
date buildings house amongst others , historians point to the two dates - 1730 and 1737 years . 
but in any case , it turns out that the nearly 300 years . 
the old yard , always open the door , squeaky staircase . 
doors in the apartments are located near each other , the chair covers were cracked , and in просветы from peeling plaster seats visible street . 
it seems that everything rests on honest word . 
but local residents are told : &quot; you don &apos;t think it is . &quot; 
live in a wooden house of the 18th century , it is very difficult , &quot; says Tatiana ( 1961 , a resident of apartment # 3 . 
the object is on госохране , but money for its content is not allocated tens of years , and we feel museum artifacts , about whom the authorities simply forgot . 
the last renovation was 40 years ago . 
the wall even though with great difficulties performing well , but the foundation of the entire прогнил . 
many residents still go to the toilet on the street , and higher once a week in a public bath . 
how can we be satisfied in such conditions ? 
the road passes directly under the windows , even a pedestrian zone . 
Tatiana will put off behind . 
now see what before was only heard : under the windows of the rushes the flow of cars . 
you see , glass дребезжат constantly , with the windows open can &apos;t , and the noise are accustomed . 
the man as to the outcome , for good and bad . 
our apartment is still a top , thanks to her husband , hands him gold . 
moreover , two of the rooms we have , and live together with her son . 
but for other families , the conditions are much worse on the second floor at all was a little more than one and a half metres tall . 
in contrast to Tatiana invites the guests to the roommate out of the apartment , No. 6 Lyudmila Старостиной . 
nice friendly woman with threshold offers up a cup of coffee and with a sad smile said : 
we have a one-bedroom apartment , 14.5 m ² on the four people and live with her husband and daughter with his granddaughter . 
I am here with the birth , another boundary has never been seen before , &quot; Lyudmila обводит eyes room : you &apos;re buying two couch the letter &quot; g &quot; ; one of them was the granddaughter with a laptop . 
very closely and differs little from a domestic interior : only ceilings beautiful , &quot; historical . &quot; 
but with the ceiling regularly flows : tap system for good . 
Lyudmila said about his apartment routinely and amazing at the same time , as an Italian , the house which stands on the Roman ruins . 
that is the one very old and recent , everyday and legendary : 
water spent about 40 years ago during the last repair . 
at the same time have made us a small kitchen in закутке and toilet from former чулана . 
we live in a time where квартировал Demidov family , on the second floor were servants . 
our apartment is privatized , and why ? 
in real estate , so they say , privatization does not matter . 
still get only a one-bedroom apartment can &apos;t apply for more . 
already four months ago promised us расселить , but promises it won &apos;t matter . 
not used to complain and I will not . 
in this apartment ( bedroom ! ) lived for an entire dynasty : my grandparents , Mom and Dad , I &apos;m with my husband and my daughter with his granddaughter . 
things happened during that time . 
for example , здоровенные rats ran in the kitchen . 
look at the walls , they one-meter wide thickness . 
they say that a solution was involved in eggs , so long rests . 
House built thoroughly , thank Демидовым ! 
perhaps , but so far no one killed crumbling ceiling or сваей . 
only construction still slowly dying there in his eyes : the board and log house гниют , floors have repeatedly failed , pouring cement , but all of it - the solution goes into the ground , as well . 
they say , and is under our bathroom the concealed лаз and move to the river White , who had once lived here there had to be protected from the danger , in which case . 
they also pursued . 
Lyudmila Starostina , tells how it came some historian , pleaded to let that he started in the flat excavations . 
and then urged to give them housing space in exchange for its однушку in October . 
Lyudmila historian refused : 
where do we daily in однушку ? 
but here at least a tiny hope is that will give housing more spacious . 
&quot; do you not agree that we on the exchange , would not have won . 
however , the family Старостиных nothing and not won . 
the biggest dream of Lyudmila to расселили , and daughter with one 16-year-old his granddaughter gave a separate room . 
then there are the two families have identified two-room apartment instead of the majestic ruins , in which two generations living now . 
pretty , миниатюрная girl Olesya Карсакова from world No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house . 
in two cramped squeezed totaling 23 m ² , called apartments , lives with her large family . 
altogether seven people , two of them . 
see for yourself what conditions . 
plaster butt falls off with pieces , like window frames , the walls in the kitchen , and the cross-cutting holes . 
the water in the кране all year just cold . 
walking about the apartments of the old home , you can be sure that the most fortunate spouses Лаврентьевым from apartment No. 4 . 
they occupy the most spacious rooms of the first floor . 
you &apos;re right , places a lot ! 
the 75 square , directed three people . 
we live in those rooms , where legend has it stopped police during his stay in Ufa , says head of the family of Aleksandr Dmitrievich Lavrentyev . 
ceilings are high , spacious . 
one bad - all around the train wreck , falling apart , collapsing . 
neighbors probably already told . 
the torment we have with the sexes : wooden boards сгнили , the earth literally walked out of the legs . 
I put подпорки , wedges ; in the hall still nothing , and in another room walk , both on a seesaw качаемся , so all you can . 
the house merchant Евдокима Демидова Aleksandr Dmitrievich can tell you better than any guide . 
the золотопромышленнику refers to the native , speaks of it with admiration . 
indeed , the personality was fantastic : host Кагинского and Узянского plants built houses , отливал guns and bells , kept Ural mines . 
heirs merchants estate forefathers proud , but live under one roof with history no longer want . 
I am settled here , even as a child , in the 1940s , of the 20th century , &quot; said Aleksandr Dmitrievich . 
then around stood wooden room and barn and sentry boxes , subsequently снесенные . 
in 1968 , wanted to remove , and our home , but something prevented . 
later in 2014 : again поманили new housing . 
we , as a team , and gathered all the paperwork , обегали necessary resort , and suddenly learned that moving to an apartment in 2015 or 2016 . 
something already doesn &apos;t believe in all this . 
two years ago , Lavrentyev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan , to learn the fate of their homes . 
officials of the occupier was not accepted . 
sent from one desk to another , but then , as mockery , given the paper without the signature and seal : &quot; the Ministry of Culture is not objecting to resettlement tenants . &quot; 
I have even a feeling that our house has long been not in terms of the city since he first was at number 57 , then became 57 A , now 57 / 1 . 
as if he had been demolished in the 1970s . 
&quot; a planet &quot; urged the head of sector informational-analytical work managing the land commission be Vladimir Барабашу . 
a house on the street of the October Revolution 57 / 1 is included in the resettlement of old housing . 
I cannot answer for the actions of the officials in the 1970s , only know that at the time there was a plan for demolition of old homes , despite the historical significance . 
fortunately , this has not happened , and the decision of the authorities is to rebuild the old house on the street of the October Revolution , representing architectural value , is successfully implemented . 
tenants soon planned расселить on new apartments . 
according to Барабаша , restore House Демидова are Italian specialists who have participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice . 
now in Italy passes architectural exhibitions , and the &quot; Old Ufa &quot; presented there , among others . 
I hope that by 2016 all former Old short street will telephone , &quot; said the official . 
home purchase order , a fact that was earlier , three centuries ago . 
House Демидова , is likely to become a museum , open to all comers . 
in addition , the government decided to make the street over the weekend . 
on weekdays , unfortunately , does not work , is too much workload of roads in the city . 
расселить people from the future museum Vladimir Barabas promises in 2015 . 
however , it is unlikely they will be : their new apartments will be of the same area , and that the current . 
only from another era . 
in Primorye due to a thunderstorm started a wildfire 
dry the storm was causing forest fire in Охотничьего personnel brave in Пожарском region of Primorsky Krai . 
in place of ignition is building up its forces and resources . 
according to the information management КГСБУ &quot; Commerce air base , &quot; preferences on location of fire conditions require the involvement of aviation . 
Vasily Medvedev , deputy head of the base : 
the fire caused by difficult terrain , discovered летчик-наблюдатель with onboard patrol aircraft An-2 on 3 hectares . 
burning wood , remnants of the old горельнике . 
strong захламленность territory and the steepness of the slope of more than 45 degrees , the lack of suitable for disembarkation десантников-пожарных sites pose significant difficulties in extinguishing . 
you need the Mi-8 helicopter . 
delivery of power available at the disposal of the base by helicopter on and jet An-2 intensely difficult . 
after discovering a fire on the fight were promptly planted 4 парашютиста-пожарных . 
the main task of professionals is fire-fighting and training platform for the delivery of additional forces and resources . 
in the lunch area in the village of Hunting helicopter additionally delivered 3 десантника-пожарных . 
once a playground for landing a helicopter in the area of the fire will be ready , the experts will we now stand at the fight , according to the website of the Primorye region . 
Lenny Henry : my father never embraced me . 
never say , &quot; I love you &quot; 
Henry was one of seven children born to a family of immigrants from Jamaica in Dudley in Мидлендс in 1958 . 
his father , who died when Henry was 19 , he worked in a factory , and their relationship has been limited . 
Henry репетирует comedy , &quot; Rare records Rudi , &quot; which is partially based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of programmes on Radio 4 . 
the soundtrack is a mix of 199.4 and rap , and melodies - жизнерадостны . 
but Henry had to wading through some difficult memories of childhood . 
after the death of his mother was &quot; a lot &quot; of treatment , in addition , Henry often mused about the relationship with his father . 
he was very inaccessible . 
you never saw his face , you &apos;ve only heard his voice : &quot; don &apos;t make noise . 
отстань dated sisters . 
шевелись ! 
I want to watch the cricket . 
my older brothers , Seymour and Hilton , who were older , when I was a child , walked with him in the pub and talk about these things , as a form of beer glasses , the beauty of the strike in Plus . 
I &apos;ve never been with him not speaking . 
he was such a неулыбчивым guy in the corner , which was a big part of my life . 
recently , Henry discovered are studio in Dudley and , although conditions were better than in the days of his father , he was able to take a look at what must have been his life . 
now there &apos;s a little bit better , but it &apos;s dark , дымные , depth of labyrinths &apos; full extent of Hell with outbreaks of fire and smoke and a bunch of soot . 
my father залезал in the bathtub and just lay there , and you have heard , as he slowly begins to sing about himself , because he wanted the отмыться from 02 shop . 
when I came back , I realised that he was doing this for years and years , to earn money for food , and I began to appreciate it more . 
nevertheless , Henry came from a childhood devoid of parental love . 
my father never cuddled , never said , &quot; I love you . &quot; 
only when her mother became ill at the very end of her life , we started to talk : &quot; I love you , I love you , I love you . 
the birth of her own daughter , Billy , from Don French , allowed him to share the love with which he lacked as a child . 
you can stop it , &quot; I love you &quot; ? 
just don &apos;t hug me ! 
dad , I &apos;m 22 ! 
with Dawn French . 
why me along with her , not to make friends ? 
she &apos;s a great mother 
they are still great friends with the French , to whom he was married for 25 years . 
don is a good man . 
why don &apos;t I make friends with Don ? 
she &apos;s a great mom . 
the mother of Henry had diabetes . 
he was the one that killed her . 
so , when I was very , very recovered and I had symptoms of diabetes , my doctor said , &quot; You need to take drastic measures . 
then I began serious training фитенсом , and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms . 
it &apos;s very hard . 
and that &apos;s boring . 
nobody eats carrots . 
a change of career trajectories of Henry reflected , perhaps , in his noble , briefly подстриженной beard . 
since he received the recognition of critics for his Othello , he completely immersed in theatre . 
followed &quot; Комедия mistakes , &quot; and then &quot; hotel &quot; Огаста Wilson . 
this work is different from sitcoms and comedies that were неотъемлимым attribute his busy professional life . 
he started his career , when he was 16 and worked in a factory . 
DJ remarked as he parodies on the stage , and wrote about it in &quot; The new faces . &quot; 
his career in television began in the mid seventies : &quot; quite a long time I was the only black пародистом / first on television . &quot; 
he was learning on the job . 
I not only had to grow in the eyes of the public , I had to learn how to be an effective vehicle for delivering jokes between 1975 and 1985 , as a star , working on television , and it was very hard . 
Lenny in the &apos; New faces &quot; in 1975 
as his manager had the right to &quot; Black and white show minstrels , &quot; light entertainment program , in which people &quot; чернили themselves face , &quot; Henry found out what is in it for five years . 
my family is a very disliked . 
I was , like , I wish that this had never happened to me , but I don &apos;t regret that I did it . 
although it was strange , worthy of condemnation position , I worked on large venues and learned to work with a crowd . 
but what was &quot; which received awards light entertainment classics on British television for years and years , &quot; was &quot; grotesque to black people . &quot; 
introducing characters who were abusive to the culture of black men in the UK , and perfume of her , Henry worked in alternative комедийном project in the 1980s . 
the first season of &quot; Show Lenny Henry &quot; was broadcast in 1984 , and in the 1990s he was known as , among other things , the chef Гэрет Блэклок from the comedy series &quot; Biased ! . &quot; 
commercials , documentaries , television series and roles in cinema took over the next ten years of his life , but after his putt on the BBC in 2008 , &quot; LennyHenry.tv , &quot; he thought , &quot; what are you going to do next , Len , because some think you &apos;re тянешь time or quietly сворачиваешь aside . &quot; 
next was a series of documentary broadcasts on Radio 4 called &quot; What &apos;s good for ... ? &quot; 
the first was about 0-9 ) . 
I was a genuine allergy to Shakespeare . 
we cannot say to me adequately taught this at school , and I thought that it was , in many ways , the prerogative of the white people of the middle class with колготками and cabbage downstairs in front . 
so I very much his fear . 
all of those we interviewed for the show , Peter Hall , Trevor Nunn , Adrian Lester , Judy Денч said : &quot; you need to try . 
not ругай it as long as you don &apos;t know what you are talking about . 
произнеси aloud some of those words , and you will understand why we still love Shakespeare . 
Henry read about 20 rows from the last monologue Othello for the documentary , and his зацепило . 
I had the feeling that I can do it . 
it &apos;s like my head выправили . 
&quot; that &apos;s what it is , this is a serious case , Treat seriously , pedestrian your text , conduct a study . 
so , the process of rehearsal was tough , and I read this play for months and months before we had set . 
and it was a success . 
it seemed that they were waiting for a disaster , but it has not happened . 
soon we began &quot; Комедию mistakes . &quot; 
suddenly I was at the National Theatre , and I just couldn &apos;t believe it until the end . 
there was one moment when I thought , &quot; Oh , you have changed . &quot; 
a technical problem , and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the audience . 
&quot; the Pacific voice inside me said : &apos; you have to work 10 minutes until they чинят computer . &apos; &quot; 
instead , assistant director announced that view will resume as soon as the problem will be solved . 
I walked away from the scene and something in me said , &quot; Oh , thank God . &quot; 
it &apos;s not my responsibility . 
I can &apos;t let someone else deal with it . 
&quot; you &apos;re playing in , stay in the role . &quot; 
Henry in &quot; заборах &quot; in theatre Дачесс 
learn the text for &quot; Заборов &quot; was difficult . 
panic is quite useful , she strengthens muscle . 
it also accepted the fine , so this was a sign showing : &quot; here &apos;s what you need to do . &quot; 
he says that , of course , Громовым voice . 
so I держусь this . 
I really love it . 
I love being in the репетиционном hall . 
by the way , Henry is still thinking comic - all the way our conversation перебивают flashes his humor , when he then starts , it finishes to parody . 
I just decided not to work in стендапе because this thing with the instant gratification of a full room of strangers , I think , quite dangerous . 
if you have all the time in this want , it could lead to a standstill . 
I sometimes work in &quot; Прямом broadcast in Apollo , when I want , but , in the main , I don &apos;t get as much pleasure as before . 
I ask , would he give tour стендапа ever . 
the joy of sitting in a room with the director , who is helping to shape the beginning , the middle and the end of the road - I don &apos;t think that will ever willingly relinquish it . 
this is his new incarnation ? 
I think so . 
I like to be an actor . 
it &apos;s pretty fun . 
you always tell a story , and here is a great place for this . 
I love history . 
people love stories . 
Kenya registers public officials to identify &quot; работников-невидимок &quot; 
Kenya began биометрическую registering all civil servants in an effort to remove &quot; работников-невидимок &quot; from the payroll of the government . 
employees who are not registered in the next two weeks , no longer will have to pay , according to a government statement . 
the government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving public service . 
President Ухуру Кениата promised to reduce corruption in government agencies after it came to power in 2013 . 
an audit earlier this year found that at least $ 1 million ( £ 700,000 ) a month disappears through payments &quot; работникам-невидимкам &quot; and other financial irregularities . 
the government suspects that wages continue to act on bank accounts , even after a person dies or leaves the service , according to reporter BBC Ваньяма Чебусири from the capital , Nairobi . 
all public servants should come within the next two weeks in expert centres , to ensure that their data will be collected through biometric registration procedures , according to a government statement . 
anyone who does not do this without cause , the case will be removed from the payroll , according to him . 
&quot; this procedure is significantly contribute to streamline the civil service , identifying the actual number of public servants , and will also be used to purify your billing statement on both levels of government - hence , end the problem of &quot; работников-невидимок , &quot; said Ann Вайгуру , Cabinet Secretary planning and structuring of power . 
dozens of Turkish police officers arrested in connection with the &quot; plot &quot; against the government 
only 33 of the officer &apos;s police officers were detained in Turkey on suspicion of &quot; conspiring against the government , &quot; according to local news agencies . 
the police did not immediately comment on this information . 
among the detained were 14 senior military officers , according to the Daily News . 
some of them last December have participated in events to identify corruption , which was intended to check government employees , including four government ministers . 
in July , a few Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of an organized criminal group and listening to the phone . 
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan ( who at the time was prime minister ) determined their actions as part of the measures taken against him and the other facing the Islamic he Фетхуллахом Гюленом . 
not all of the children returned to school in Ukraine 
schools in the greater part of Ukraine again opened its doors on Monday ( September 1 ) after the summer holidays . 
this day is traditionally a big event for families and , like thousands of other Ukrainian parents , Prime Minister Arsenii Yatseniuk took his daughter to school . 
there he said ожидавшим reporters that not all schools again opened , but that he would do everything possible to protect this country for future generations : 
the first of September , the ceremony was held not in every school . 
there is a peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine . 
we must fight for the peaceful sky . 
the whole Ukraine , a huge single Ukrainian People &apos;s Front , must strive for a peaceful sky . 
Aleks Pastukhov , director of schools in the difference in which went daughter Yatseniuk , said in Russian . 
we hope that the world finally located here and that children will receive the knowledge that will be useful in their future lives . 
the first day of school traditionally celebrate the fact that children wear embroidered shirt , keeping in the hands of hot air balloons and flowers for their teachers . 
in the face as the Фейрхед BBC may have found such an impressive leader , who she needs 
the tail of the glory from the world of banking , management , media and domestic circles Party Tories . 
in fact , it has its own experience of working in managerial positions . 
her career began in consulting firm on global governance system and Co , and then continued in Morgan Stanley , Bombadier , certificates and the world media in the Pearsons . 
she was the head of the Financial Times for seven years , resigned when a senior position in the parent company of Pearson &apos;s took коллега-мужчина , who held a lower position . 
they say that its earnings are approaching £ 1 million . 
its political rating also abrasion . 
it advised David Cameron Lord Browne , the former head of BP , when he tried to bring professionals from the private sector in Whitehall : she became an adviser to the Cabinet . 
her husband , a former adviser to the Tories . 
earlier in May , I called the job of chairman of the poisoned bowl . 
the BBC is not only a huge and complex organization at the heart of public life , but in its structure , there are internal paradox . 
the Council is of two kinds : inside as the upper level management hierarchy of the BBC , but outside as the voice of the public concern and unrest , when something goes wrong . 
it &apos;s almost hopeless дуополия , which requires a complete radical reform . 
but what the new chairman will have to take the risk come растаптывая and destroying the institution is as complicated as the Chinese dynasty , if he would himself work in this process . 
it &apos;s a tough decision . 
would this not so difficult , many people will be glad to see the BBC reduced in size , &quot; after a review of its powers , the finance and status . 
as the competitors providers and new technologies challenge cosy old habits , inevitable negotiations about the cost of a licence represents a special danger for the BBC . 
for the modest sum of £ 145,50 per year the British gain share in , specifically , the greatest media company in the world . 
BBC tells a good story : she says that the results of its work encompasses 96 percent of households and every one of them just 40p a day . 
furthermore , it is obvious that the Beeb is rising : 53 percent support it today , against 31 per cent 10 years ago . 
model viewing and use the BBC have changed : I now get news headlines on a mobile phone and watch missed programmes on iPlayer . 
but she remains very popular and substantial institution . 
he needs an impressive chairman - I hope they find him . 
Perry of Texas says that humiliating production was written by outsiders 
production from any account of the Governor of Texas Republican Rick Perry on Sunday night contained offensive image of District Attorney General from the Democrats , which is located in the center of a criminal prosecution on charges of abuse of power . 
production later was removed , and behind him was followed by another with the account Perry , in which this record was дезавуирована . 
just with my account was published in production , which was written by outsiders . 
&quot; I don &apos;t approve of this production , and I took it , &quot; according to a later entry . 
aides Perry did not immediately respond to messages requesting comment . 
while the recordings were loaded with any account Perry , it was unclear who was actually involved in the publication of the tape . 
an earlier production contained нелестную caricature on Attorney General District Travis Розмэри Лемберг , which police for driving in a state of intoxication in April 2013 . 
Perry imposed a ban on funding for her office when she refused to resign , which led to a hearing a jury in Austin this month against Perry , who is a potential presidential candidate in 2016 . 
the signature in explode &amp; then glew &#91; sic &#93; states : &quot; I don &apos;t always drive my car in a state of intoxication , three times more than the permissible level of alcohol in his blood , .. but when I do I claim charges against Governor Perry for what he tells me about it . &quot; 
I &apos;m the most drunk Democrat in Texas . 
agency Лемберг not guided investigation involving a large jury against Perry . 
it was Michael Маккрум , a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was appointed судьей-республиканцем . 
Perry has not pleaded guilty and called the prosecution a political ruse . 
his powerful legal team asked the judge leading the case , reject the indictment , arguing that the law used to prosecute the governor , calling their responsibilities for the longest in the history of Texas , opporunities , which is contrary to the Constitution . 
Perry stopped funding by $ 7.5 million from the state &apos;s compilation of public control of the State , which is based in the District , Travis and charges of corruption in the public sector of Texas when Лемберг refused to resign . 
the veto led to a formal complaint by a group of public control , with left-wing views . 
the tape of any account Perry frequently updated - and sometimes becomes famous . 
came fifth at the Party Congress in Iowa during his presidential campaign in 2012 , Perry responded to rumors that he might quit the game publishing production with a run near the lake , and the words : &quot; that &apos;s we , South Carolina ! &quot; 
Berkeley said that the market returned to &quot; normalcy &quot; 
one of the most prominent developers in London , warned that the real estate market in the South East of England &quot; returned &quot; to normal levels of activity . 
homes in the capital were the subject of buoyant demand and rapidly rising prices , while widely spread fears that the credit bubble will push the Bank of England to set limits on mortgage loans in June . 
Tony Пиджли , Founder and Chairman of the machine building company , Berkeley , on Monday said : &quot; since the beginning of the current financial year , the market returned to normal levels of transactions , with a peak in 2013 , &quot; adding that it provided &quot; a stable working environment . &quot; 
the London real estate market flourished during the downturn as foreign buyers gathered in the capital . 
prices in the city have soared by 18.5 percent over just the past year , according to the Land inventory , significantly outpacing average 6.7 per cent across England and Wales as a whole . 
the average market prices in the private , affordable and student schemes Berkeley rose by about a fifth in the past year , reaching £ 423000 in late April . 
however , the strengthening of sterling in recent months has made London property less attractive to foreign buyers , some of whom stopped and the introduction of new taxes on property and political rhetoric around potential &quot; tax on mansions &quot; before the general election next May . 
London agency Foxtons last week warned that April reform of the mortgage market , which were introduced more stringent conditions of the loan , also will lead to a decline in market growth as the transactions of sale of real estate , and prices in the second half of the year . 
fresh data from the Bank of England on Monday showed the number of approved mortgages in June , suggesting further cooling in the housing market . 
Hamptons International , another agency , cut its growth forecast for London property for 2015 to 3 percent on the basis of that commitment real estate prices already began to weaken . 
the volume of transactions , meanwhile , fell by a quarter compared with the previous year , in the most expensive areas of London , such as Chelsea , Мэйфэр and Kensington , according to agency WA Ellis . 
nevertheless , demand for homes in the capital turned out to be very profitable for Berkeley , by volume of sales on the amount above £ 2.2 billion . 
Mr. Пиджли added : &quot; the demand for the goods with good design and the best location has remained the same and , reflecting this , sales in the period have been preserved . &quot; 
in June , the company reported that sold 3742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than in the pre-crisis peak in 2007 . 
annual profit before tax rose by 40 per cent compared with the previous year to £ 380 million , income - by 18 per cent to £ 1.6 billion . 
swearing on Monday before the annual meeting , Mr. Пиджли reported that alleged income Berkeley this year will meet current market expectations . 
according to that analysts expected profit for the year before tax at £ 450 million . 
the share price of Berkeley has rested on £ 23,96 during the second half of the day on the London Stock Exchange . 
photographs of nude Jennifer Lawrence were published on the internet a hacker 
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at 85-ую ceremony presenting the annual prize of the American Film Academy . 
photos of topless actresses Jennifer Lawrence , an Oscar , were uploaded on the Internet a hacker , who insists he has &quot; catalog &quot; photos of another 100 rising stars . 
representative stars &quot; Голодных games &quot; confirmed that the photos of Lawrence are real and denounced hacker for &quot; insulting invasion of personal space . &quot; 
received treatment in law enforcement , and they will pursue anyone who will post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence . 
the photos , which originally were built on the site of photo sharing 4chan allegedly were obtained due to lack of system онлайн-хранения Apple iCloud , and the &quot; catalogue &quot; of hacking victims includes the names of the dozen женщин-знаменитостей , including Rihanna , Kim services , Mary Elizabeth Уинстед and Мэри-Кейт Olsen , according to BuzzFeed . 
it is unclear how many of these photographs are authentic , though star &quot; Scott Пилигрима against all &quot; Уинстед on Twitter also condemned the hacking . 
&quot; anyone who looks at the photographs that we made with her husband a few years ago , retreating at home , &quot; I hope you &apos;re proud of yourself , &quot; wrote Уинстед on Twitter . 
however , Victoria Justice of serials Nickolodeon &quot; iCarly &quot; and &quot; Виктория-победительница &quot; denied that in photos , writing on Twitter : &quot; these so-called photos of naked me , people . 
let me остановлю this in the bud . * tasty pun intentional * . 
BuzzFeed reported on Sunday that a representative of the pop Арианы Grande refuted what photo on which , presumably , she was genuine . 
an exclusive excerpt from the new novel Howard Джейкобсона about love and the letter &quot; J &quot; that generated praise from critics 
they weirdest thing about , the best way to say it , they gradually разваливались , like a cardboard box that was left in the rain . 
but sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious , hard to communicate , tense , and maybe a little раздражительный . 
and then she пожимала his hand . 
he saw in his irritability . 
he was колючим like hair , yes . 
the last victim of this колючести was little novel , from which he waited longer than usual , lonely and boring life , and perhaps even some satisfaction . 
Эйлинн Соломонз was pulsating fragile beautiful with взлохмаченными hair and трепещущим heart of northern island village , even more remote and harsh than Port Ройбен . 
she came to the south with master older than himself , whom Кеверн believed her aunt , while the latter has inherited a house in crude , but like Paradise Valley under the joyful called Райская Valley . &quot; 
no one lived in the house for several years . 
the pipes were trickling in defence were sitting motionless spiders , слизни left their footprints on all the windows , confident that the house belongs to them ; garden зарос weeds like giant кочаны cabbage . 
it was like a cottage from children ’ s books , simultaneously terrifying and wonderful , full of secrets . 
opinion of the author : Howard Джейкобсон , whose novel &quot; J &quot; included лонг-лист Букеровской premiums in 2014 . 
the shortlist will be announced next week 
Кеверн and Эйлинн sat , holding hands , in a broken industry among the high grass , enjoying surprisingly warm spring day ; they both absentmindedly to cheap consoles , which provided with country appeasing music and 3-zmianowy news , when , glancing at her crossed brown legs , he remembered the old song long forgotten black performer , whom he loved listening to his father , the curtains in the house . 
you have a very big feet . 
in view of the inherent aggressiveness , songs of this type on the console will no longer lost . 
they were not banned - nothing actually was not forbidden , just more of them is not lost . 
they have become архаичными , as the word &quot; archaic . &quot; 
public taste did what would never have succeeded in orders and regulations , as well as among the books people chose memoirs rich , staying in poverty , cookbooks and love the novels , of all the music they chose ballads . 
happens this afternoon , Кеверн began playing the ideation piano and rough comic voice singing great legs Эйлинн . 
Эйлинн not understood . 
&quot; it was a popular if jazz pianist named Фэтс Уоллер &quot; , he told her , mechanically to his lips , two fingers . 
so did his father to stop the letter &quot; J &quot; before she power immediately from his lips . 
it started with the game , in which they played when he was little . 
his father played in it with his father , as he told him . 
start the word with &quot; J &quot; , forgetting put over his mouth two fingers , &quot; and it will cost you a penny . 
it was not very fun back then , and it was not very fun right now . 
he knew that from him , wait , that &apos;s all . 
he had to explain what is jazz . 
Эйлинн never heard . 
jazz is playing , even though he was not explicitly prohibited . 
improvisation went out of fashion . 
in life , there was only one &quot; if . &quot; 
when the music started , people wanted to know exactly where it will end . 
with wit in the same way . 
his unpredictability had people on the nerves . 
but jazz was wit , marked with the help of music . 
although he has reached the age of 10 years , never слышав about Sammy Дэвисе Младшем , Кеверн knew about jazz from paternal полусекретной коллеции CDs . 
but at least he did not have to speak Эйлинн that Фэтс Уоллер was black . 
given her age , it is unlikely she remembered a time when popular singers were not black . 
again , there are no laws or pressure . 
society was docile , and this meant that every segment of the agreed with gratitude - the gratitude of those spared the fate , &quot; with the principle of group predispositions . 
people афро-карибского origin in temperament and physical characteristics are suitable for areas of entertainment and sport - and they were singing and ran . 
natives Индостана , as if by nature talented in everything that concerned electronics , the fact that no family is left without a working electronic phone . 
what is left of the Polish diaspora , substitutes works ; what is left of the Greek , should have a plate . 
originating from the Persian Gulf and the bank , whose grandfathers were rapidly leave the country when THEN , WHAT happened , IF ВООБЩЕ happened happened , in fear that they were accused of inciting the flames , in fear , in fact , that the fire consumes their following , have opened restaurants with лабне and get , not dropping and yearned from leisure . 
each according to his abilities . 
as she had heard only ballads , Эйлинн was difficult to understand how offensive the word , who had just sung her Кеверн , could be laid on music . 
music is an expression of love . 
&quot; they didn &apos;t really offensive , &quot; said Кеверн . 
except , maybe , for people who have great legs . 
my father have never offended , but he loved this song . 
he said too much , but launched a garden gave him the illusion of security . 
no word could not penetrate the US giant leaves similar to капустные . 
Эйлинн still did not understand . 
like your father could love this ? 
he wanted to say that it was a joke , but he did not wish for her again , eases to the lips , two fingers . 
she already thought it strange . 
&quot; it was funny , &quot; he said instead . 
she недоверчиво shook her head , closed Кеверну review . 
the whole world was nothing but копны her иссиня-черных hair . 
nothing , that he would like to watch . 
&quot; well , if you say , &quot; she said , in his opinion . 
but that still doesn &apos;t explain why you &apos;re me her sing . 
she seemed really upset . 
I have too big feet ? 
he looked at them again . 
you cannot say no . 
ankles , maybe a little bit . 
and you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick ? 
I hate you ? 
of course , I don &apos;t hate . 
it &apos;s just this stupid song . 
he could say : &quot; I love you , &quot; but it was too early . 
&quot; I like you very much because you have thick ankles &quot; , tried to say he instead . 
I have such a distortion . 
it was wrong . 
he wanted me to this was ridiculous . 
attempts by the joke often led him into awkward situation , because , like his father , he was missing the soothing charm that could mitigate the cruelty , крывшуюся in whole or in part . 
maybe his father wanted to be cruel . 
maybe he , Кеверн , wanted . 
despite the good eye . 
Эйлинн Соломонз flushed and stood up with the lounger , the oldies on the console and the wine that they drank . 
wine from the referendum , so that drugs could not serve as his excuse . 
in his excitement , it seemed , was trembling , like living beings leaves in the weather system . 
&quot; and you , I like you very much because you have a pointless head , &quot; she said . 
though not like you very much . 
he felt sorry for her and because of the excessive brutality of his words , and because of fear , who appeared in her eyes when she gave him the state . 
was it that he had it hit ? 
she has not talked to him about life on the cold northern archipelago , where she grew up , but he has no doubt that the main traits she was similar to здешнюю . 
the same huge icy ocean struck on both of them . 
those same American pilots could reflect with men , even more sensitive and accused after THAT happened , IF ВООБЩЕ happened than their ancestors , the smugglers and разрушители , shopped in fury from pub to pub , ready to raise a hand on any woman , посмевшую deny them or поддразнить them . 
pointless head ? 
they would have shown her a fist , if she was not cautious . 
first would be kissed , kiss now became the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman ; an antidote from fresh ballads , too , which provide proper console - the first kiss her , and then hit . 
excessive clarification , according to Кеверна because the kiss itself was already хулиганством . 
Эйлинн Соломонз case showed that he needs to leave . 
he rose from the lounger , like an old man . 
she herself felt the lead weight , but the weight of his grief surprised her . 
this was not the end of the world . 
they barely knew each other . 
she looked , as he goes , and out of an upper window looked , as he leaves , her companion , the man himself взваливший themselves to others . 
Adam , outgoing garden , thought she was . 
she felt a stab of sympathy towards him and men in general , even though some of them and raised her hand . 
a man , отвернувшийся from it , with the pulpit , пристыженный , slain , the ability to fight left him - why she felt she knew so well , if she could not recall a single occasion , until today , when she saw this ? 
again one Эйлинн Соломонз looked at their feet . 
for twenty years prior to the above events or so Esme cantered Нуссбаум , intelligent and energetic 32-летняя исследовательница who worked in &quot; Офнау &quot; , an informal service control over Community mood , has prepared a report on the low and medium levels of violence in most parts of the country , where it was expected that it will be reduced , if not over entirely , given the means and the forces that were allocated to its eradication . 
&quot; a lot has been done , and a lot is being done , &quot; she wrote , &quot; to ease the innate aggressiveness of people who fought in a war and won most of them , especially among these спутанных branches and narrow расселин area , where , despite Centigrade over изгородями spires of churches , gentle breath of human kindness rarely has been felt in the whole of history . 
however , some quality , it turns out , неискоренимы . 
the higher the spire , it would seem , the низменнее those passions that he зарождает . 
the population of sheds tears over sentimental skipping , drinking stories about преодоленных obstacles and announces its overheated belief in the virtue of marriage and family life , but not only the old rudeness retains its strong grip as in rural communities and in urban settlements , but there is evidence that the emerging new and vile задиристость in homes , in the workplace , on roads and even in playgrounds . 
&quot; you have досадная habit of writing too much , &quot; said her supervisor , having read the report as a whole . 
it seems to me that you should read shorter novels . 
Esme cantered Нуссбаум lowered his head . 
I must also ask you : you атеистка ? 
&quot; I think that is not obliged to answer , &quot; said Esme cantered Нуссбаум . 
are you gay ? 
Esme cantered again insisted on his right to privacy and silence . 
feminist ? 
again , silence . 
&quot; I ask , &quot; finally said Luther Рабиновиц , &quot; not because I am against atheism , лесбийства or feminism . 
here we have no prejudice . 
we are the servants of society without prejudice . 
but some kinds of hypersensitivity , absolutely reasonable and a good in themselves , they may sometimes distort the results , such as those that you showed me . 
it is obvious that you yourself предубеждены against the church , and what you call &quot; malevolent &quot; and &quot; rude &quot; , others would be interpreted as an expression of natural healthy and intensity . 
continue нудеть about BUT THAT happened , IF ВООБЩЕ happened , as if it happened , if it happened yesterday , it means depriving the country needed her life force . 
Esme cantered Нуссбаум огляделась on both sides until Рабиновиц said . 
over his head , pink as gimmicks and LED letters repeated advice that &quot; Офнау &quot; gave the country the last quarter of a century or more . 
улыбайся with his neighbour , the value of his wife , listen , go on demonstrations , talk on the phone , communicate , объясняй , listen , соглашайся , извиняйся . 
the conversation is better than silence , word of the song better than the written word , but there is nothing better than love . 
&quot; I fully understand that you want to say , &quot; quietly replied Esme cantered Нуссбаум , when satisfied that her supervisor had finished speaking , &quot; and I don &apos;t want to say anything , except that we &apos;re not излечились as efficiently as we convince ourselves . 
my concern is that unless we are ready , we will find that repeat mistakes that initially led to ТОМУ THAT happened , IF ВООБЩЕ happened . 
only this time we выбросим their anger and distrust the other . 
Luther Рабиновиц joined his fingers in a sitting . 
that gesture was supposed to mean an infinite patience . 
&quot; you go too far , &quot; he said , &quot; calling &quot; mistakes &quot; actions that made or not made our grandfathers . 
you go too far and when talking about what they threw away their &quot; anger &quot; and &quot; mistrust &quot; in the &quot; other . &quot; 
in your place , people should not need since saying that , understanding the past is , by now , we &apos;re not talking about &quot; us &quot; and &quot; them . &quot; 
there was no &quot; us &quot; and no &quot; other . &quot; 
it was a time of turmoil - that &apos;s all we know . 
&quot; for which , to be honest with ourselves , &quot; ventured into Esme cantered , &quot; neither part of society may well justify themselves . 
I do not accuse . 
whether it &apos;s bad or good , what is done is done . 
then it was back then . 
nothing needs to be said - and here we agree . 
and how does not need anyone to blame , don &apos;t need and making excuses , if that was appropriate , or if it could be something to fix . 
but why the past , if not to learn &quot; 
past Update to ensure that we have forgotten . 
if I can add to that one word - 
pyramid of Luther Рабиновица fallen apart . 
&quot; I &apos;ll review your report , &quot; he said , and dismissed her . 
the next day , on the way to work , her knocked мотоциклист , who rode on the sidewalk , as described by passersby , &quot; in a vicious rage . &quot; 
coincidences happen . 
army Lesotho says coup is not planned ; the prime minister remains in South Africa 
representatives of the Army Lesotho denied the fact preparing a coup to overthrow the government , saying that they acted against the police , which is suspected of trying to arm of political fanatics . 
Prime Minister Thomas Табане left the country , saying that the army of a country surrounded by his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital Масеру . 
the prime minister took his family in neighboring South Africa , saying he received threats on his life . 
a spokesman Army Major Нтлеле Нтои said that was not , in fact , a coup , but that the army has responded to the threat from &quot; political fanatics &quot; , which the police tried to outfit . 
&quot; what happened this morning , it is that the command of the armed forces of Lesotho has taken action after receiving several intelligence reports suggested that among the forces police , there are some elements that really plan to equip some political , young fanatics political parties who were prepared to foment chaos , &quot; he told Voice of America . 
a South African government Клейсон Моньела said that the actions of the army looked like a coup . 
&quot; although nobody has filed claims on the seizure of power by force , by all reports , the actions of the armed forces of Lesotho at the moment are the signs of a coup , &quot; he said . 
representatives of the Army Lesotho reported that soldiers returned to barracks on Sunday , and that in the capital of calm . 
meanwhile , Deputy Prime Minister Мотетжоа Метсинг runs the government in the absence of Табане . 
Табане said he believes that the assault in connection with an attempt to fight corruption in the country . 
the situation in Lesotho is quite tense since June , when Табане suspended parliamentary session as a result of differences in their combined government . 
he said that his actions have not undermined the government , despite allegations otherwise . 
midfielder Chelsea &apos;s Marco van Гинкел will spend the coming season on loan at Milan , &quot; said Milan Channel . 
21-year-old Dutchman arrives in Italy in the coming hours for medical examination .

recall that earlier Milan leased from Liverpool striker Fernando Torres . 
manufacturing in the eurozone at its lowest figure in 13 months 
output growth in the eurozone slowed to the lowest in 13 months in August , according to a popular study . 
the business index ( PMI ) of manufacturing sector growth in public fell to 50.7 in August , dropping from 51.8 in July . 
the value of above 50 indicates growth . 
new orders Barbarossa , and businesses have suffered amid growing tension between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine . 
the values were received before the meeting of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) on Thursday . 
the markets will be waiting with a clear plan of how to cope with recovery in the eurozone , as well as the threat of deflation , with inflation of just 0.3 per cent . 
there is an assumption that the head of the ECB ’ s Mario Draghi announced later this week , may give further signals that he is contemplating scheme of quantitative easing in the eurozone , similar to those used by Britain and the United States during the financial crisis . 
&quot; although some growth is better than just no growth , braking effect of the growing economic and geopolitical uncertainties on producers are becoming more obvious , &quot; said Rob Dobson , senior economist at public . 
PMI manufacturing sector in Germany , a major trade partner of Russia in the EU , has fallen to the lowest in 11 months of 51.4 . 
meanwhile , the second largest economy , France , the PMI fell to 46.9 . 
France continues to cause real concern , as well as weakening Italy from stable growth to stagnation . 
signs that growth momentum faded mainly industrial engine , Germany , as well as in Spain and the Netherlands , also adds to the confidence , &quot; said Mr Dobson . 
the industry will likely still would add fuel to the fire analysts anticipating the introduction of additional monetary or tax-based incentives . 
one positive news was from Ireland , where the PMI rose to 57.3 , its highest level since the end of 1999 . 
Howard Арчер , chief economist at IHS Global Insight , said : &quot; the best that can be said about the August survey index of business activity in the manufacturing sector in the eurozone is that it shows that the sector is still growing . &quot; 
he added : &quot; the eurozone is clearly finding life very difficult at the moment , as the current increased geopolitical tension - particularly associated with the Russia / Ukraine , adds uncertainty still difficult conditions in many countries . 
this increasing tension , apparently hit by business - and especially on the confidence of consumers , and is likely to lead to the fact that some orders are delayed , or even cancelled , especially large orders . 
he said that &quot; more and more it looks like &quot; that the ECB , of course , will have to conduct some kind of quantitative easing , &quot; although we suspect that it will be limited . &quot; 
residents of Mariupol offered living chain against militia 
in Mariupol , until last week , it was all calm , nobody — to organize Мариупольскую folk republic , a town on the Azov Sea , lived and worked . 
now residents of the horror to come &quot; militia . &quot; 
according to political analysts , separatists break to Мариуполю to go to Азовскому sea - was recently taken town Новоазовск , who also was a member of the self-proclaimed republics . 
мариупольцы decided that the Ukrainian army , though , and will be defending them , but to force it a bit against a well armed representatives ДНР-ЛНР and gathered to help the military . 
they say trenches , build the roadblock and strengthening . 
on Saturday night , several thousand people arrived on the eastern border of the city , and stood there in the live circuit , singing the anthem of Ukraine . 
they are going to do the same in case of attack . 
volunteers collect and equipment and products , collect the drugs issue , the newspaper said . 
in a city gradually close shops , stop job banks and ATMs . 
ten years of hell for the survivors of the Beslan : ten years with жуткого takeover of schools as children , who were in it , still suffer 
ten years ago , more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen rebels at a school in Beslan , in southern Russia 
more than 330 people , more than half of them children , were killed during the three-day trial that shocked the world 
we returned to Beslan , to find some of the victims who had cheated death during the atrocities in school 
exactly 10 years after the deadly seizure of Beslan school , during which killed 334 people , including 186 children , heroically survived catastrophe warned last night about the new апокалипсисе in Ukraine . 
when the terrorists that Islamic fanatics , captured and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004 , at the beginning of the new quarter , it seemed something like extreme extent possible evil . 
the tragedy united the east and west in dread , which famously then turned into action and hope for the future in the imposing of grief . 
ten years later , we returned to Beslan in southern Russia , to find some of the victims who had cheated death during the atrocities in school . 
we found amazing young people who stood against trouble , although memories of terrorist hell will live with them forever . 
their greatest hope ? 
that war , which now afflicts Ukraine , in which the same children as they die , now . 
a young girl in the picture trying to climb back into the обстреливаемый gymnasium 
she project the image of a famous Russian photographer Dmitry Белякова when in underwear trying to climb back into the обстреливаемый gymnasium after the explosion . 
embarrassed by Equipment desperately searched for his mom , Ларису , who is now 40 . 
there were fears that the two they died , but in fact they survived . 
&quot; the woman told me to run hard , but I couldn &apos;t , &quot; said then , like ) . 
my legs were covered with blood . 
I got up and climbed back inside to find his mother . 
the soldier picked up her and took in a safe place . 
after a chain of operations , it is thought that fully recovered , but yesterday said : &quot; three months ago , the pain returned . 
I &apos;m afraid that I might need another operation . 
a few fragments left in my vertebrae . 
her goal now is to become a dentist , to help people like her have helped doctors . 
&quot; this tragedy has changed my life , but it &apos;s certainly not поломала her , &quot; she says with a challenge . 
&quot; it happened to me , and you cannot change this fact . 
once a year I always go to the gym , to remember all those who have stayed there . 
my friends and I tried not to talk about it on other days . 
the pain is too strong . 
my best friend , who was supposed to be my year , Дзера Гапоева was murdered there . 
we played together when we were young , and dreamed that go to school together . 
&quot; I do not want to get married until I &apos;m gone though studies and will not work . 
I &apos;ll have to think about the family later . 
she says the seizure is still with her , though memories a little bit the fade every year . 
I am pleased that many people in the world still remember about our predicament , and we are so grateful for the assistance we received from people from the UK and from everywhere . 
when I look at a picture where I &apos;m лезу in school window , I think that many people will see it for the first time , learn about this tragedy and will do so that this never happened . 
the boy , who fled through a hail of bullets , believing that his mother is dead 
it was his first day at school ( the Russians are beginning to study at school in seven years ) , and went through three days of capture , his mother Тамару . 
when he was seven , and he said , &quot; my mom told me to lie down , if there is an explosion , and hold her hand . &quot; 
after one of the explosions , he thought that she was dying . 
she told him : &quot; come . &quot; 
fearing that she is dead , he ran , and along the way , he saw the crying baby , grabbed the child by the hand and ran through a hail of bullets . 
his father , Vladimir , who grabbed his son outside , said : &quot; the Damir told me that his mother had died . 
he said : &quot; I couldn &apos;t save her . &quot; 
in fact , Tamara climbed to freedom and was in the hospital with wounds in the legs , in turn , thinking that her son was killed . 
after their reunion , she said : &quot; I cried with joy . 
I couldn &apos;t believe it . 
he rushed and hugged me . 
mythic later brought to London ( now несуществующая newspaper News of the World ) , where he was awarded as small children from the Fund Barnardo &apos;s Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife , Sheri . 
&quot; this horror is returned to you every day , but I wish I could stop remembering him , &quot; he said yesterday . 
but I can tell you that in my memory it is to fade . 
I remember right after that I threw all of my игрушечное weapons . 
but I can now play computer games with shooting , and it &apos;s not a problem for me . 
&quot; I am not afraid to return to the gym , but I didn &apos;t think about herself . 
I remember those kids with whom I played in the yard , which has not escaped . 
we would never say that they killed or dead . 
we say that they stayed in the gym . 
I remember my trip to London so well , especially in a toy shop , where they let me choose what I wanted , and traveling in a car with an open top . 
but now he is afraid for such places as Ukraine , where war causes such grief , which survived , he and his friends . 
this horror comes back to you every day , but I wish I could stop remembering him 
&quot; I feel so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors , &quot; said Damir , who in the past week , doing volunteer work in a women &apos;s monastery . 
I want to help . 
I want to serve in the police ever , and I hope that I am included in training academy in the next year . 
his mother , Tamara , 48 , said : &quot; 37 children , have been killed in this quarter , could you imagine ? 
I remember the horrible silence immediately after their capture , simply did not have children , who would have screamed and ran around and this silence lasted for many months . 
she vividly remembers his trip with Дамиром in London . 
people in London cried when I told our story . 
I realized then , as people on the other end of the earth can understand our feelings , can support . 
she was grateful to &quot; Sheri Blair and its fund for the award and the opportunity to go to London in the autumn of 2004 . 
I would like to call Sheri and simply by her to say that 10 years have passed , but I still remember a meeting with her and her husband in London and how they helped Дамиру and me . 
I remember when Damir wanted to eat , they rang up all the local Russian restaurants . 
I remember how he played with the waiters are in the restaurant , Damir shot at them from his water pistol , and they flee and played with him . 
and only one month has passed since our nightmare . 
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our grief and to support us . 
she said : &quot; I still think that this world was no better over these 10 years . 
now in Ukraine is a war and people are dying every day , and I think many children have been killed or be killed . 
it &apos;s just the same as ours . 
I think for many people , war is a news broadcast , that they listen to when they get bored or when they are busy with something else . 
I just know that these people are feeling , the horror of it . 
and I can &apos;t stop feeling it . 
nothing has changed , people still want to kill each other , and it &apos;s so sad . 
Damir grew up and became very soft and quiet as a boy , he &apos;s not an aggressive and angry . 
he is not looking for revenge , for example , he did not just fixed on it in this last nightmare . 
I know that he does not like to remember it , but they are very close with six classmates , and they go to the gym from time to time and burn candles there . 
when he was younger , he suffered from it - I remember that as he lay on the couch , facing away from us , for hours . 
not slept , and his eyes were open . 
I also remember how he threw all his weapons and other military toys . Дамиру now 17 , he was above me , nice , smart and healthy . 
I can hardly believe that a few hours I was so sure that he is dead and that I never see more . 
when I was able to recover from the explosion and rose to his feet , I огляделась , I saw hell around himself when parts of bodies were lying everywhere . 
I was absolutely sure that it is not possible to my little boy could survive in this hell . 
&quot; I remember that I shouted at him : &quot; Damir , come , убегай &quot; , but again I was so sure that he was not heard . 
but he heard , and ran off . 
so life for us continues , unlike so many others . 
Georgy Ilyin , 17 years 
the boy , whose shocking photo after capture was decisive for the Beslan tragedy 
peace : surviving Beslan Georgy Ilyin with her mother Фатимой after his capture in 2004 , and to the right of Georgy today 
on his bloody face was a mark of fear when they were fleeing from death , when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates . 
his photograph was one of the most shocking character barbarism in Beslan . 
his mother , Fatima , 54 , the chief doctor , enrolled him in school in the first day of school before the culmination of the eldest son of Vladimir in university . 
&quot; I went away for two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard , so that my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmare , &quot; she recalled . 
not just one , there was the family of our relatives , but they were all killed . 
only my Dima managed to survive . 
the closer the date , the harder to think and talk about it . 
there is not a single day when we won &apos;t remember this tragedy . 
we don &apos;t think that it was a long time ago , I think it was yesterday , some scenes these days every time I got in front of his eyes . 
no one will never forget , I promise you . 
западает soul : a photograph of George ( left ) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was увековечена into sculpture ( right ) 
I remember George just wanted to go to school that day , said that he wants to hug teacher . 
I only found out that he was alive when I saw him on TV . 
and now even have the sculpture crying George in San Marino . 
George doesn &apos;t like to look at this picture , and she was hidden in the closet at home . 
I understand , but I also think that the photos of people from all over the world are feeling the pain . 
George says now : &quot; it is important that this never happened . 
&quot; I doubt that we ever learn the truth . 
people continue to investigate this tragedy and will never learn the truth . 
now they are investigating the collapse of Boeings in Ukraine . 
whether we ever , what was it called ? 
this world is going to something very bad . 
&quot; I can &apos;t understand how it happens , because if you ask people , and nobody wants a war , because it is happening ? 
ten years is nothing for this pain . 
we need to have dozens of years slightly to forget her . 
it has affected my health , and I still made her feel . 
about three or four years I have nightmares because of the takeover , but now it became better . 
I returned to school later in 2004 , I was very scared every day . 
I thought about my friends and get rid of , who were killed . 
that &apos;s why I continue to walk into the gym before every September 1 . 
I want to pay tribute to the memory of my old friends . 
I find it difficult to enter the gym , but I must do this . 
I don &apos;t feel like a victim , this story is part of my past now . 
I won &apos;t forget about it , but I don &apos;t have feeling sorry for ourselves . 
my life continues . 
I graduated from high school this year and enrolled in the Medical University in Vladikavkaz . 
I &apos;ll learn to become кардиохирургом . 
my first choice was to go into the army . 
I wanted to be a military man , but health I &apos;m not allowed . 
I want to fight for my country , but this will not happen . 
Georgy Фарниев , 20 years 
the boy , who survived , despite the fact that he was at the feet of террориста-убийцы 
incredible : George Фарниев was at the feet of террориста-убийцы during capture , but still he managed to survive 
during his capture , he was international in the sports hall sitting next to a bomb at the feet of террориста-убийцы . 
indeed , it is a miracle that he was not killed . 
&quot; it seems to us that it was yesterday , &quot; says Giorgi , who wanted to study for an officer of the intelligence in the FSB , but couldn &apos;t because of the damage that was caused by his health during his capture . 
it &apos;s still with me , this is not something that I left behind . 
I am older now , and they say that children can easily cope with bad events , I must say that this is not true . 
&quot; in 2006 I worked with psychologists , and I felt a bit better after that , but I can &apos;t forget it . 
but I &apos;d like to forget . 
in 2005 , &quot; the following year - was the first and last time , when I went into the gym again . 
I lost consciousness . 
I would never go there again , and , please , don &apos;t ask me to show , where I sat on this famous photograph . 
an A-bomb survivor : George Фарниев today with open on a laptop a photograph of himself in a hospital after seizure 
my pain is enormous , and I carry it with me every day . 
my friends know that I don &apos;t like to think about it or talk about it , and they never asked me about my school . 
with regard to the physical condition , and I &apos;m healthy . 
I need to be cautious with the knee , which was damaged , but now I go okay . 
but health is not allowed me to go to study at the Academy of the Federal Security Service in St Petersburg , as I wanted to . 
I sent my documents , including medical reports , and they said that was impossible . 
my second passion was animals , so I went to the institute . 
I studied there for two years . 
he learns to treat all animals , from cats to cows . &quot; 
he said : &quot; I know that never will talk to their children about their experiences . 
it is not what children should know , and , of course , is not what they need to survive . 
his mother , Marina , 42 , said : &quot; the pain never leaves me . 
she &apos;s in my soul , and worse , when the anniversary is approaching . 
I will go and will attend the ceremonies , which will be held , to celebrate her . 
I know that George did not go . 
for him it should be even stronger , because he was there , but I &apos;m not . 
I was waiting for him at home and couldn &apos;t help . 
I am so grateful to God that he came back to me . . . here in Beslan print lies on each . 
he remains with us . 
George , now an adult , but the nightmare was still with him . 
it &apos;s hard to take when something so terribly unfair that happens to you . 
he was a boy , he loves the sport , but he can &apos;t do because of the knee . 
he had several operations , he can walk , but he can &apos;t exercise . 
I would say that he was 50 % overcame this nightmare , but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it . 
this eerie experience will remain with us . 
many of my friends and neighbors had been killed during the capture , and this only reinforces my pain . 
I lost a lot of people who I knew well and who were dear to me . 
my son with me , and this is the best gift that God could I do , but my heart aches for those who had been killed . 
I know the family were born , where new children , but I know and widows who never married . 
it &apos;s hard to accept that life goes on , even if you don &apos;t want to . 
I will never forget how heart выпрыгнуло out of my chest at that moment when I saw him in the hospital . 
now I look at what is happening in the world , &quot; the war in different regions . 
what these people are fighting ? 
why are they killing each other ? 
the war is very close to our country right now , and to me with difficulty in this scene . 
we were a close-knit country in the past , how did it come about that we are fighting now ? 
men and children are suffering , I am sure , many children have already been killed in Ukraine , and many will be killed . 
if they can grab all the rebels and throw away - far away , as soon as possible .

is there cheese after the embargo : Medvedev gave advice аграриям 
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said that the terms of the embargo Russian аграриям should adopt new technology to build the popular among buyers of varieties of cheeses . 
the council was given during a visit to the &quot; Югптицепром &quot; firms &quot; agrocomplex . &quot;

the chief coach of the national team of Russia Valentin Маслаков pleased with results of the tournament DecaNation . 
according to the expert , the third place is a good result considering the absence of targeted training for competitions . 
our athletes were on his level , &quot; the &quot; sport &quot; make Маслакова . 
third place is confirmation of our fairly high command level . 
is pleased that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal . 
we should bear in mind that we are not prepared for these competitions . 
the season is over , and we will not require our leaders to participate in the match DecaNation . 
in recent years , we were second at this tournament , but this season we have updated team . 
the French , by contrast , is still fighting a team that includes 13 champions of Europe . 
they do not conceal their intention to win this year , has repeatedly publicly declared . 
but even as the hosts of the event failed to confront the Americans . 
therefore , I believe that the Russians have acted in such a representative company at a good level . 
but the results in some species were considerably lower than in the same &quot; Бриллиантовой league . &quot; 
the season is over . 
of course , the athletes are not so important , especially in a competition team level . 
most importantly , here was a place . 
but according to the results , agrees that reached an absurd when the 1,500 meters men so you ’ re into tactical хитросплетениями running that showed a lower than average ... women run . 
4 tips , how to achieve a better quality of underwater photos and videos 
if you want to take photos or shoot video under water in front of you a whole range of options . 
the cheapest option is waterproof &quot; Point and Shoot , &quot; for example , the Nikon Coolpix AW120 , or экшн-камера , for example , the GoPro Hero3 + Silver Edition , both of which are sold for about $ 300 . 
I took these pictures on a family holiday with the help of several cameras , all for the price of about $ 350 . 
no matter what equipment you use , the more rules you need to abide by in order to achieve the best results . 
перепроверяйте their equipment . 
even if you have a waterproof camera , make sure that the case the cameras and other branches of the tightly closed . 
in addition , set up their camera for the type of photos or videos that you shoot . 
some of the photos and video cameras there were shooting or object type , which optimise exposure for mages underwater conditions . 
and before you jump in the water , look at how deep your equipment can fall . 
some cameras are aimed only at 5 feet , others - 50 or 60 feet . 
look at our leadership of the buyer and the ratings of digital cameras , both for conventional and for November models . 
remove a few frames - because many of them don &apos;t enclosures . 
&quot; essentially &quot; is the LCD , which lets you assign images , whereas the экшн-камер them usually don &apos;t . 
even if you have LCD , it will be difficult to see under the water , and the layout of the frame is a random process . 
so do a few frames . 
also , if your camera has the serial shooting , which takes several shots with slightly different installations that use them . 
stay near the surface . 
the amount of light is significantly reduced , the deeper you нырнете under water . 
if possible , stay near the surface , when you &apos;re shooting in a swimming pool , a river or ocean . 
it also allows you to transmit more colour in photographs ; the deeper you get , the fewer colors you &apos;ll see . 
подплывайте closer to shooting . 
this is excellent advice for shooting on the land , but it is even more important under the water because of the mages light conditions . 
it is especially important if you &apos;re shooting on экшн-камеру : this equipment often comes with a fixed , широкоугольной lens , which means that you have to get closer to shooting , if you want to fill the frame .

Andrew Lawson was such a man , whose force of personality could shake things around , even in such a giant organization like the National Health Service . 
консультирующий anaesthetist , he has devoted his career deliverance patients from suffering sickness and remorse . 
among those who spoke to him , recalls his wife , was an officer in the M16 , who had to live with devastating effects of torture . 
Lawson knew that as long as Dr. passionate about being diagnosed and diseases , those being treated mostly worried about something else -- the pain . 
one day in 2007 , however , he appeared to those who suffer . 
&quot; I never felt , as usual , &quot; he wrote in May last year . 
I found it difficult to find the strength within themselves . 
struggling with symptoms similar to flu , he found that irritated reproaches his wife Джулиет . 
&quot; I want all happened sooner rather than later , &quot; said he . 
when Джулиет left for over a week , Lawson found that he is unusual and it is not clear why upset . 
something was wrong . 
he asked a colleague to do X-rays of the chest . 
just two weeks before he went skiing in Французских Alps . 
results of the X-rays came . 
it was mesothelioma , a terminal cancer , which affects плевру , or the lining of the lungs . 
for most cancers it is difficult to determine an exact cause . 
although some people succumb to cancer of the lung , for example , not all patients with cancer of the lung smoked . 
but with mesothelioma differently . 
in almost all cases the cause is contact with asbestos , grainy construction material , who once called a &quot; miracle , &quot; but which , as we now know , deadly dangerous . 
for most of us mesothelioma is a disease that you don &apos;t pay attention . 
asbestos , in the end , is the material from the past . 
the most dangerous type of asbestos is not used in the UK since the 1960s , when these industrial ban came into force . 
even when it has been used , only people from specific sectors worked in close contact with him : трубоизолировщики , builders , carpenters and workers of all computers , for example . 
industrial toxin from another era , he hardly seems cause for concern today . 
but such a calm erroneously . 
Britain , it turns out , is now at the peak of the epidemic мезотелиомы . 
here from мезотелиомы kills more people than any other country on the planet . 
the annual death rate in about 2,500 people , more than twice as many people die from the disease than as a result of road crashes . 
the annual number of deaths from мезотелиомы since 1980 and projected the number of deaths in the future in the UK 
the reason we feel its deadly consequences right now , lies in the fact that , although the use of asbestos and it is illegal for many years ( all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999 ) , for the development of мезотелиомы go usually tens of years . 
and attack мезотелиомы is not limited to veterans specialties industrial construction . 
asbestos was and , in many cases , remains , laid in the house where we live , where we work , schools , where we learn , and shops , where we go shopping . 
as a result , mesothelioma does not pay attention in class , the level of prosperity , profession or age . 
bastions of избранности , from the fashionable London department stores to private schools , as it turned out , not salvation . 
parliamentary building is riddled with asbestos . 
even hospitals that are meant to treat us , turned out to be reservoirs of this fatal a carcinogen . 
Andrew Lawson was not old . 
he was not трубоизолировщиком . 
strictly speaking , he had to think where he might have come into contact with asbestos . 
then he realized . 
&quot; it seems that there might be a lot of asbestos in tunnels in the hospital Guy , where I spent six years on it , &quot; he wrote . 
all are students , nurses , doctors and грузчики - used these тоннелями . 
I wonder how many of my peers expect the same disease ? 
it was a question to which , unfortunately , he was able to give a partial response . 
&quot; of the four doctors that we just need to be in hospital for Guy and have subsequently developed mesothelioma for the past five years , &quot; he said in a letter in 2010 , &quot; I alone remained alive . &quot; 
how many of us expect this disease ? 
Andrew Лоусону was diagnosed with &quot; mesothelioma , &quot; when he was 48 years old . 
when he died on February 17 this year , he was 55 . 
live so long is unusual . 
fifty percent of patients with mesothelioma die through eight months after diagnosis . 
it is always fatal . 
so , now , we can only repeat the question Lawson &apos;s : &quot; how many of us expect this disease ? &quot; 
according to a leading expert on Kolya in Britain , Professor Джулиану Пито , most likely assume that between 1970 and 2050 , when the asbestos epidemic in Britain should bootmaker himself will die about by people . 
most now are not that would die that way . 
asbestos mine in Quebec , Canada , with 
a quick review of reports from the halls of the court , where victims are often seek compensation , shows how far it has spread attack мезотелиомы . 
in June , for example , Marks &amp; Spencer acknowledged that included three Джэнис Ellen contact with asbestos . 
she worked for nine years , from 1978 to 1987 , departments of clothing on two sites , one of which was the store on Oxford Street . 
Mrs Ellen was just 18 years old when she started working at M &amp; S. 
now her two children are older than 20 years old . 
&quot; before this happened , &quot; she says , &quot; I have never heard of Kolya , I barely knew about Асбесте . 
me in the head and could not have come that I was hurt . 
few people really are aware of Асбесте . 
in fact , asbestos is not one substance , and a group of six minerals . 
they get their name from the word &quot; асбестиформ &quot; , which means the fibrous structure , which tells them the strength and flexibility . 
of those six , three were often used in construction . 
chrysotile , widely known as white asbestos , much more often than other occurs in buildings today . 
it has been used in roofing panels , used tile , thermal insulation pipes , boiler looks , even in brake колодках cars . 
he less смертелен than other forms of asbestos , but still recognised by the European Union and the World Health Organization &quot; major source of harm health , &quot; which can lead to death . 
more dangerous , however , brown asbestos ( амозит ) and blue asbestos ( крокидолит ) . 
Britain was once the world &apos;s largest importer of brown asbestos in the world , and experts have suggested that &quot; there are good , though indirect reasons to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with mesothelioma &#91; in the UK &#93; . &quot; 
an employee of the Marks &amp; Spencer was exposed to asbestos in the main store on Oxford Street , London with 
Джэнис Ellen may not have thought of himself as a typical victim мезотелиомы , but work Julian Пито suggests that her story is not unusual . 
he conducted a study of patients , which suggests that a &quot; substantial percentage мезотелиом when there is no known exposure at work or at home , were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment . &quot; 
the bulk of this impact , he says , is &quot; normal use and exposure to weather &quot; in our buildings . 
no one , it seems , can &apos;t be sure that he is safe . 
the report Goddard Consulting , which was Westminster Palace , demonstrates how people , even in the heart of government , may have been exposed to unconsciously . 
in 2009 , Goddard said that technical mines and pipelines for the premises of parliamentary committees were infected with asbestos , lethal fibres which could follow in the movement , something so harmless as &quot; strong currents of air . &quot; 
members of the parliament often blame the fact that they are pursuing their own interests , but in this case it seems that is the opposite . 
although the dish on the maintenance of Parliament insisted that Westminster Palace received a &quot; clean bill of health , &quot; and now she recognized that it is necessary to work on the £ 1 billion for the reconstruction of the Parliament , by upgrading electrician and removing asbestos , and that after the general election in 2015 , members of Parliament , perhaps , will meet in the conference centre and their fertility rates collapse near , but not on the green benches horizon . 
the report Goddard said , noting that &quot; the situation with the asbestos is not reformers in accordance with different rules . &quot; 
it is impossible to know whether this error management cost lives . 
all I can do now is wait . 
one of those who could not identify their exposure to asbestos is Graham cost , general practitioner . 
as Andrew Lawson , cost , 50 years , suspects that he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals . 
&quot; I worked at the hospital , which has successfully been indicted claims associated with asbestos , &quot; he says , &quot; But I can &apos;t prove this in my case . 
it &apos;s so hard to remember all the places where he worked , and dates . 
what he remembers clearly , so this day in early December 2009 , when his wholly overcame something that was like the flu . 
he was 45 , and he was in the middle of the operation later in the evening . 
suddenly I were shaken as . 
it started very quickly . 
I felt terrible . 
I thought that I won &apos;t be able to drive all the way to homes . 
as a doctor , cost knew that pain comes from , including checking for iframe loads , the membranes surrounding the lungs . 
however , like Джэнис Ellen , he simply had no reason to suspect мезотелиому . 
in the end , he could not walk to work a month . 
7.8 doctors did x-rays chest and put плевральные катетеры to pull fluid from the lungs and send it for analysis . 
and yet his condition оставлось without the diagnosis . 
gradually , his health has improved , and he returned to work . 
but from time to time , those same symptoms return , often after he engaged in sports , and he breathed heavily . 
in 2011 , one of the patients Dubai came to him in the office with similar symptoms , and he was later diagnosed with &quot; mesothelioma . &quot; 
but even then the cost of not linked it with its own case . 
in the end , his patient was ten years older and worked with asbestos . 
in this case , was obvious . 
in September 2011 , the state of Dubai deteriorated again , and Kazakhstan his doctor showed him the results of CT scans and x-rays to a group of experts . 
in December 2011 , just two years later , after the cost of operations , began to feel ill , the sensor , equipped with a camera , was introduced in the cavity between the shell of his chest and shell of his lung . 
I &apos;m an optimist . 
I usually just go further , &quot; he said . 
I &apos;m not too upset about it , to be honest . 
but Rachel , my wife , experienced . 
the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year : &quot; I was told that it was mesothelioma . &quot; 
Graham cost : diagnosis mesothelioma 
suddenly cost sank during a meeting with nurses Macmillan , one of which suggested he contact a lawyer . 
it was then that he realised the scale of the epidemic . 
&quot; it turns out that asbestos was commonly used , especially in large public buildings , and where quite often there was asbestos thermal insulation systems on the planet , &quot; he says . 
people who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings , now succumb to the disease . 
thus , mesothelioma now affects more young people , atypical professions . 
the most dangerous isolated the asbestos pipes in hospitals were in basements , so it is unlikely that affected patients . 
but many employees who were on pedestrian tunnels connecting nearby landmasses can bring together to get from one building to another ( as Andrew Lawson ) , or eat in the basement canteens ( how often did Graham cost ) almost certainly really were exposed to toxic substances . 
for several decades after the war , as it turns out , the hospital was a place where , in theory , pulled the life for поциентов , but of a place , which constituted a threat to life for doctors who treated . 
it still continues to resonate today . 
students set their burners Бунзена on 3rd Son 
and it &apos;s not just hospitals . 
asbestos was often used in offices , shops , libraries and мэриях because of his amazing insulating and огнестойких characteristics . 
schools too . 
strictly speaking , most likely , for the first time were exposed to asbestos in the classroom . 
nationwide , on countless lessons chemistry students set their burners Бунзена on 3rd Son . 
there websites , highlighting the problem of asbestos in schools . 
meanwhile , in our homes , such harmless things as floor tiles or roof сараев typically contained asbestos . 
&quot; it &apos;s an industrial poison , in a huge number of our buildings , &quot; notes Andrew Morgan , a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson &apos;s in a case against the hospital Guy . 
in one case , the only contact that she could remember the woman who was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s . 
so be careful , снося garden sheds . 
the effect of the diagnosis , when we know that the disease is incurable , is huge . 
&quot; to realize it , is quite a lot of time , &quot; says Graham cost . 
I went back to work and tried to continue , but I realised that I couldn &apos;t focus on what I &apos;m doing . 
I stayed in the surgery for two weeks . 
then I realized that I had to go and deal with them . 
well , I could no longer meet Christmas 
one of the most difficult things was the transition from doctor to patient . 
as countless patients before him , he remembers , was confused with information that should have been taken . 
&quot; it has been difficult for everyone to understand , &quot; he says . 
&quot; I asked his doctor &quot; how many I have time ? &quot; 
gave me about 12 months . 
I remember , as I thought , &quot; Well , I &apos;m not a Christmas . 
that &apos;s all . &quot; 
mesothelioma is particularly dangerous , as it is the mechanics of how we support life , &quot; is the act of breathing -- causes cancer , which kills . 
most cases мезотелиомы caused by contact with asbestos . 
asbestos is composed of tiny fibers . 
when asbestos is being destroyed and fiber carcinogenic , they could get stuck in плевре , shell the lungs . 
the fibers of asbestos irritating плевру and can cause mutations . 
&quot; the problem occurs because of breathing the needle fibers of asbestos , &quot; Professor Tom Трежер , кардиоторакальный surgeon , who came in 2001 in hospital Guy . 
it is the same hospital where , as suspected , Andrew Lawson , he was exposed to asbestos , now , ironically , a leading center in the treatment of мезотелиомы . 
Трежер knew Lawson &apos;s and treated some of the others who , perhaps , was exposed to while in the hospital . 
when иголочки asbestos into the fabric of the lungs , says Трежер , &quot; breathing them unload on the periphery , where the shell . 
it is , in its essence , think the process from the outset . 
conventional treatments of other forms of cancer is much less effective in Kolya . 
the effectiveness of surgical intervention , for example , cause hot debate . 
some think it &apos;s worth a try . 
Трежер disagrees . 
&quot; you can &apos;t cut плевру , &quot; he says . 
it around her region with a knife . 
meanwhile , the cancer is &quot; not very well to chemotherapy , &quot; which &quot; acts &quot; , but not people . 
&quot; from time to time there are patients who live a long time , &quot; says Трежер . 
but ultimately , they all die . 
fortunately , some patients are living much , much longer than expected . 
writer Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after he was diagnosed . 
two and a half years after diagnosis , Graham cost continues to fight . 
after he became ill to mesothelioma , Dubai acquainted with Andrew Лоусоном , which , four years after the diagnosis , single-handedly turned into office support and consultation for these same patients . 
&quot; yes , Раковая Central , &quot; cheerfully told it , when they called . 
&quot; he was very positive , &quot; says cost . 
he was diagnosed with four years ago , and he still is very energetic . 
first Эбботту offered six cycles of chemotherapy , which would take four months and prolonged his life only a month . 
&quot; I was in despair , &quot; he says . 
I wanted to give up . 
Lawson , however , &quot; managed to somewhat more positive agenda . &quot; 
meeting with several specialists , cost decided to continue treatment with Professor Лоиком Ланж-Лаздунски , professor торакальной surgery in hospital Guy . 
&quot; we had an advantage in that I don &apos;t need it , I just called them and they took me , &quot; admits Graham . 
consultants , the patient would have to get the direction and approval for funding . 
money plays a decisive role for patients with mesothelioma , in order to get the best available treatments . 
however , when such treatment , finally , inevitably turn out to be ineffective for many patients face another financial reason for concern &quot; about the future of the families that they would leave . 
and then they ask the courts for compensation . 
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan , of Field Fisher Price Waterhouse LLP . 
&quot; it has been known that asbestos is harmful to health , in 1898 , &quot; said Morgan . 
but that changed in the 1960s , is that it became clear that even very small quantities can put their health at risk . 
it was then spoke about the bad faith of companies . 
Andrew Lawson and hospital Guy , ultimately , resolve the matter , but this was not a &quot; settlement at full price , &quot; according to Morgan , as Lawson could not clearly prove that his mesothelioma was a result of exposure to asbestos in the hospital , Guy . 
after the investigation into his death , a spokesman for the hospital , Guy is confirmed , however , that &quot; asbestos in its basement , mentioned above , was removed in the 1990s . &quot; 
it was too late for Andrew Lawson &apos;s . 
how to remove asbestos 
strictly speaking , and bind to lethal exposure to asbestos to one company or place of work - usually through dozens of years after that , it turned out to be a big problem for patients with mesothelioma , demanding compensation . 
many of their former employers have changed owner or shut down . 
insurance archives could be lost . 
and those who have protected from lawsuits , and know that on their side , which the plaintiffs , of course , no . 
in response , earlier this year took a serious new legislative acts which facilitate patients with mesothelioma process recovery of compensation , even if their former employers cannot be tracked . 
in accordance with this law , was created by £ 350-миллионный fund of funds , which is financed by the insurance industry , for those who had been diagnosed after July 2012 and who cannot prove to contact , but who are not with whom to sue . 
in such cases , patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in a case about the compensation of about £ pirates . 
about 300 successful claims under this scheme is expected to be every year . 
Andrew Morgan , like many who work with patients with mesothelioma , believes that the £ 350 million represent a &quot; very good work &quot; for the industry . 
&quot; this transaction , which insured for insurers , &quot; he says , hinting that the sum is a quarter of that , insurers would have to pay if it had not intervened time and patients with mesothelioma would be able to trace the company and file a lawsuit in the usual way . 
even Mike Пеннинг , previously minister for work and pensions , acknowledged that the law &quot; imperfect . &quot; 
but Пеннинг , and Morgan acknowledged that , in view of the fact that seven people die every day , rapid action was needed . 
&quot; people suffer so much , and they need help now , &quot; said Пеннинг during the second reading of the Bill about Kolya in December last year . 
by the time Graham cost was in the hands of Professor Лоика Ланж-Лаздунски 19 months . 
after the initial consultation Ланж-Лаздунски recommended surgery , which , unlike Tom Трежера , he believes to be effective . 
this was followed by radiation and chemotherapy -- тритерапия in which Ланж-Лаздунски boasts pristine 40 percent surviving patients for five years . 
cost felt a surge of strength . 
&quot; this is , of course , one of the most important things , &quot; says cost . 
you see these patients all the time . 
there is a force that supports you . 
when сдаешься , condition can deteriorate very quickly . 
Graham cost went on an operation in March 2012 . 
by the end of August he finished last of six cycles of chemotherapy . 
subsequent scans showed no trace of the disease . 
then I did a scan in March &#91; 2014 &#93; . 
there were a few spots &#91; cancer &#93; in my chest . 
I just should have been within reach 50 . 
this is not a threat to life . 
this is the end of life . 
and again the cost went through six cycles of chemotherapy . 
now there is no trace of cancer . 
however , this process is both physically and emotionally heavy . 
you can think about practical things - about finances , and when I die , for example , or about the fact that we need to show his wife how timer on бойлере . 
when you get bad news , you become безрадостным . 
we need to look forward . 
as the father of Ellie , 16 years old , and Тэмзин , 14 years old , it is not always easy . 
&quot; it &apos;s hard for the parent , &quot; he says . 
it &apos;s hard to understand what to say and how much to say . 
when I first got diagnosed , I told the girls that I had the disease , which means that I won ’ t live to old age . 
they reacted very differently . 
Тэмзин very social and energetic . 
she said all of her friends , and we quickly called for many . 
Ellie was more demure . 
she didn &apos;t say much . 
such talk is something that has to have all patients with cancer . 
but for patients with mesothelioma such discussions people hope , even проблеском opportunities to survive . 
this disease of sex is ( even as , ultimately , for Steven Jay Гулда ) grim certainty . 
says Andrew Morgan , &quot; mesothelioma does not constitute a threat to life .

China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders , protesters promise revenge 
Parliament &apos;s decision on Sunday does not allow voters in Hong Kong nominate candidates for elections in 2017 , despite increasing demands for democratic reforms . 
such a move would likely mark the beginning of long ago promised protests in Hong Kong as activists have begun planning and mobilization in a matter of hours after that statement . 
the decision of the 11th National People &apos;s Congress , in fact , communist leaders to remove all the candidates who are not loyal to Beijing . 
&quot; it &apos;s not обмануло our expectations , but still leads in rage , &quot; said lawmaker Emily Лау , chairman of the Democratic Party . 
this is not something that Beijing has promised . 
they lied to people in Hong Kong . 
and it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime . 
defending the decision of China , Li Fey , Deputy General Secretary of the Standing Committee of the 11th National People &apos;s Congress , said that to allow public nominations for the election of Hong Kong would be too &quot; erratic behavior . &quot; 
since 1997 , when Britain handed control of Hong Kong back to China , Beijing promised to allow residents of the region to choose by voting the head of government , starting in 2017 . 
Chinese leaders have presented the Sunday decision as a democratic step forward , since it gives гонконгцам right to direct the vote ; however the resolution also makes clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process in his hands with the aid of the Commission on the Nomination , rigidly controlled from Beijing . 
and , according to a new article that only candidates who &quot; love the country and love Hong Kong &quot; will be admitted . 
the decision was taken after the summer , when there have been some of the most large-scale and received wide coverage of protests in Hong Kong for many years . 
for a large part of after campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central With Love and Peace , which threatened to cut off the financial district in Hong Kong if Beijing does not guarantee real universal suffrage . 
Sunday night , a few hours after the announcement , hundreds of supporters of the Occupy Central gathered in the rain in front of the headquarters of the government of Hong Kong . 
the demonstration , which organisers claimed that their movement is shifting to a new phase of civil disobedience and that they rise up on the waves of protest in the next few weeks . 
nevertheless , they have not reported the details , obviously , to avoid problems with government bodies . 
in онлайн-заявлении organizers reported that the movement &quot; обдумывало any takeover of the central district only as an exceptional measure , action that can be taken only if all the possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice . 
we regret to inform you that as of today , all the possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the seizure of the central region undoubtedly will . 
authorities in Hong Kong were preparing to Beijing a few days , and on Sunday at the headquarters of the government had strengthened security measures involving police and barricades . 
the unrest is a sense among many in Hong Kong that they slowly lose control over their own city . 
an influx of residents from mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services . 
also intensifies the fear that values , such as democracy and freedom of speech , and begin to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing . 
some have criticized the movement Occupy Central , saying that his demonstration to jeopardize the business is the source of life force in Hong Kong . 
&quot; the protest , which they say it could cause great economic damage , depending on how many people would take part or how long , &quot; said lawmaker Regina Yip , who has long been critical of the movement . 
we don &apos;t want to spread concern about the fact that Hong Kong can spin out of control . 
this view , which is harmful for investment . 
Chinese state media also gave reports in recent days , in which Hong Kong activists of the democratic movement were shown диверсантами , направляемыми Western powers . 
this summer , activists organized an unofficial referendum on electoral law , which drew tripped participants - more than one-fifth of voters in Hong Kong . 
and in July , tens of thousands took to one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region . 
American culture Noxwin comes to university life : первокурсникам offered arriving on personal plane 
we are delighted to respond to this demand by running the first in the UK , the travel category &quot; suite &quot; for current students . 
to leave the bright impression from his arrival at the University , the company also offers options such transportation as a personal jet , a Rolls-Royce Phantom , an Aston Martin or a McLaren P1 . 
Mr Stewart also said that service thought about security . 
this service is a perfect alternative for students , who typically have to carry their belongings across the country in dangerously strained machine . 
this , combined with our new options for Vif , we look forward to how these students this year to get to university with minimum effort and maximum luxury . 
a company representative said that , since the service has just launched , orders are not received , but added that &quot; the students begin to order this service in the next few weeks . &quot; 
the company also said that , despite the fact that students should need to pay £ 9,000 a year , she still hopes to find a market for this service . 
the current students are quite different from those students 10 , 20 , 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes : more important than ever to make a great first impression , and Vif - exactly what it should be . 
nevertheless , the National Union of Students criticized this service as their strength as an organiser comes from reality . 
Megan Dunn , vice president of the NSS on Higher Education , said : &quot; this project is incredibly taken away from a life of the majority of students . 
many students , who this month to begin his studies at the university , faced with a crisis in the cost of living , when the available financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to keep pace with rapidly rising costs for basic needs before they can even begin to think about how to take thousands of pounds on something like a simple arrival at a dormitory . 
feminists are raising questions of racial identity and behavior of police after Ferguson 
unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Фергюсоне , Missouri , earlier this month . 
coming are raising their hands , chanting : &quot; hands up , don &apos;t ice &quot; while they wait in line in front of the burial . 
after two weeks of protests in Фергюсоне , Missouri with murder безоружного teenager Michael Brown , blogger Miriam зоила Perez noticed a shift in интернет-разговоре among white feminists . 
in her experience , the white feminists , leave comments put gender above race , when it comes to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality . 
however , as the increased tension in the Midwest and attracted national attention , Peres saw the white women who focused 100 percent on the race . 
compared with the reaction of black women shortly after the killing on 9 August , personal essays with such titles as &quot; thoughts about Фергюсоне on behalf of a white woman &quot; and &quot; Феминизм is not the only example of women &quot; came relatively late . 
but for Perez , they demonstrated a significant shift . 
&quot; in feminism , I don &apos;t think there are many people who are talking about white skin and Privileges on such a high level , &quot; she said . 
people feel the need to say something about what has happened . 
it &apos;s very symbolic for the crisis with which we are faced , and because of the situation in Фергюсоне ) is so tied to race , they feel that it is necessary to specify . 
for a professor of English at the University of Ohio Кориты Mitchell Ferguson has laid bare problems with which Blacks one faced every day , but which are not perceived as &quot; women &apos;s issues &quot; in the cultural sphere . 
&quot; I can write something funny on Facebook about what was going on with me and my partner and get 150 лайков from everywhere , &quot; says Mitchell . 
when I write something about how colored people are attacked in his own country , silence clearly . 
&quot; why do women safely to publicly speak about the relationship , but not about the security in the public sector ? &quot; she asks . 
for black women , like Mitchell , who studied the issues of race , gender and sexuality in the history of the United States , there is no dichotomy between matters relating to race and gender . 
from her point of view , blacks , women are in a position to clearly separate the problems ; they are faced with a complex reality every day . 
while white women now bring together issues of race and gender in feminist мейнстриме , Энджела Хэттери , professor of women &apos;s and gender studies at the University of George Mason , said that its predecessor did the opposite . 
&quot; between 1865 and 1890 years линчевали at least 10,000 black men , and the reason that is almost always served as the rape of white women , &quot; said Хэттери . 
need a white woman , was a story to justify Nepal . 
from the point of view of Хэттери , the gap between white and black women occurred when white you have , for example , Susan B. Anthony looked at the situation in the late 1800s , and saw that the fight for suffrage will be effective only for one of the groups : women or blacks . 
&quot; they decided to put all its eggs in the basket of voting rights for women , and the right to vote for blacks would appear later , &quot; said Хэттери . 
look back on things like this gives us a clear idea of why colored women don &apos;t trust white women . 
we have not done anything good . 
we &apos;ve never helped black women to protect their husbands and sons . 
even after women won the right to vote in 1920 , it took ten years to ensure that the white women united against mob lynchings in the women of the South for preventing mob lynchings . 
this group appeared nearly 40 years after blacks , women first asked for help , &quot; said Mitchell . 
from the point of view of Mitchell , the reactions of white feminists on the issues raised in Фергюсоне , &quot; the behavior of the police , racial discrimination - reflects a time when white a feminist had to &quot; catch up &quot; problems with which Blacks women cope in several generations . 
&quot; however , it would be fine , if female , which have such a &#91; traditional феминистическая &#93; ideology , so seriously would be to raise a child , how they relate to the right to contraception ? &quot; asked Mitchell . 
feminists in the second wave , who had made his career in the fight for reproductive rights and access to контрацептивам , now you are beginning to understand what that means . 
known white activist феминистического movement Gloria Стайнем two weeks after the killing of Michael Brown took Фейсбуком and published a sharp article колумнистки Guardian Rebecca Carroll , who claimed that white Americans were more participation in protests on issues of racism . 
&quot; I hope that women who have a different , but similar reason to understand the danger of the body - and the point of view of the racial problems that are substantially different in surveys of the public - will be at the head of the change , &quot; wrote Стайнем . 
although Стайнем she vouched for more пересекающийся feminism , which includes and issues of race and gender , her comments about race in America still are surprised by some . 
a researcher at the American entrepreneurial institute Christina Соммерс , author of &quot; Who stole feminism ? , &quot; she said She The People that young men in the United States , especially colored young men , &quot; are much more vulnerable than their sisters &apos; , but negative Стайнем about Фергюсоне contradict criticism , which it clear earlier . 
we now have hundreds of special programmes for girls and young women , but almost nothing for the boys . 
but when the White House has recently initiated a programme , &quot; Сторож my brother &quot; to help the vulnerable black and испаноговорящим boys , followed in the US changed remarkably reaction from many feminists , including those from Gloria Стайнем . 
police with the black community is not the only problem , продвигающая helm of traditional feminism . 
after the Border Guard Service USA arrested around 63000 minors without support on the southwestern edge of the country this year , immigration reform again came to the surface - this time as a problem with women . 
Andrea China , co-chair of the organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform , said that in order to make this issue as important for women , she had only to share stories immigrant women . 
&quot; they speak for themselves , &quot; said China . 
when the vast majority of the workers &apos; visas are issued &#91; иммигрантам-мужчинам &#93; , women who come with them , find themselves in positions vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation . 
&quot; these stories will resonate with women &apos;s organizations , &quot; she said .

Ministry wants to accelerate the growth of the market for electric cars 
this week the Ministry of Economic Development will make the government a comprehensive development plan for clean vehicles in Russia , told the deputy director of the ministry , Oleg Плужников round table that held the Vedomosti on Moscow Carlisle - 2014 . 
the plan is drawn up on behalf of the government , one of the main goals is to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases . 
it is expected that the document will be passed in late September and early October , says Плужников , proposed measures concern the electric cars and hybrids - a development plan for vehicles on газомоторном fuel in Russia already have . 
the plan ( a copy by Vedomosti ) is designed for 2014-2017 . 
yet to develop assessment criteria for electrical and hybrid vehicles and decide how to promote the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles . 
a report to the government , which will describe the tax and customs measures to support quality , will be prepared by December 2014 , the scheme of preferential loans and preferential leasing will emerge by April 2015 , and proposals to reduce the prices of cars , promotion localization and the creation of service the infrastructure will be developed by October 2015 
in 2014-2015 , is expected to amend the regulations to ease conditions for construction charge infrastructure ( in carparks , filling stations , etc . ) . 
in addition , federal officials plan for 2015 to formulate for regional government proposals to also promote the use of clean transport - in the form of granting him benefits when driving and parking , for example ; and at the end of February 2016 - and proposals on the expansion of the government purchases of such transport . 
finally , the Ministry of Economic Development by October 2014 , on a list of indicators for evaluation of the activities of the regional authorities of criteria that reflect the effectiveness of the support for the production of clean transport development in charge of infrastructure . 
the market in electric cars in Russia , while only formed in 2013 across the country sold around 100 electric cars . 
in early 2014 обнулена import duty on electric cars , so sales will be approximately 500 pieces , predicts Chief Executive Director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia , Andrey for 25 years . 
but пятикратный growth does not Sunderland any noticeable : in 2013 , according to the Association of European Businesses , sold 2,78 million passenger cars and light commercial vehicles . 
while in Russia , Sunderland imports only Mitsubishi Motors . 
start import preparing Renault - the company focuses primarily on corporate clients , says Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships Renault Nicolas Ремиз . 
most of the other manufacturers &apos; electric vehicles took in relation to Russia is taking a wait-and-see approach . 
development of electric cars is , and the Russian producers - &quot; &quot; GAZ CEO , &quot; &quot; but the trivial . 
for example , in January - July 2014 , according to the &quot; АСМ-холдинга , &quot; Avtovaz has issued 30 electric cars . 
demand is also degrading because of soaring prices , admits director of AvtoVAZ engineering Sergei Аманов , without state support the breakout in this segment will not . 
the development of the Russian market in electric cars in addition to the cost of cars ( those electric cars that are sold in Russia , on average twice as expensive counterparts with the internal combustion engine ( ICE ) is an underdeveloped charge infrastructure ( Economics - units ) , sighs CEO &quot; Автостата &quot; Sergei Целиков . 
because of the soaring prices and low rates of decline in the cost of electric cars in the next 3-4 years remain нишевым segment of the Russian market , predicts editor in chief &quot; Авторевю &quot; Mikhail Подорожанский , Целиков with him , agrees . 
manufacturers , by contrast , say that some models of electric cars is already close to the value of the ordinary . 
the Russian market is substantially good prospects , the important thing is to instill confidence in consumers that &quot; электромобильность &quot; real ; this , in particular , will contribute to the emergence of the new charging stations , underscores the president of BMW &apos;s Wolfgang Шлимме . 
such infrastructure projects by , for example , the &quot; Россети &quot; : in Moscow built several stations , soon there will be more about 80 . 
talks on the construction of a network of Economics carried out with other regions . 
according to the director of the department &quot; Россетей &quot; Vladimir Софьина , the company believes the market for electric cars and is ready to build gas stations across the country , but there are problems : a small number of electric cars in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging different brands . 
in addition , &quot; Россети &quot; as network the company does not have the right to engage in the sale of electricity , being able to do this in relation to charging . 
his wife believes the most effective measure of state support for the Russian market substantially progeSOFT customs duties . 
zero rate will act before the end of 2014 , its renewals , extensions of preferential list . 
the replacement vehicle tax on ecological ( the idea is being discussed and concerns all machines ) , too , will support the market , but not as noticeably as customs preferences , according to his wife . 
tax in Russia is small , said Pankov , unlike , for example , from Norway , where the reduced tax rate led to a sharp rise in sales of electric cars -- now they account for 12 % of the market . 
in Russia are needed and stimulus measures to curb speculative , such as free parking in the centre of town ( as it has done in Moscow ) , I am sure Pankov , or any movement substantially in dedicated lanes , which Russia has not .

here , Alexei saw quite a different picture . 
his mother in Luhansk killed - and not someone else , and the Ukrainian military . 
my friend called and told that a mortar shelling that , most likely , it is the Ukrainian armed forces , &quot; said one of the soldiers , Alexei . 
I then wanted to leave the battalion . 
we didn &apos;t make the Иловайска , told me that we were in the ring . 
I arranged the commander , the report has already been written about him . 
us charges with Зурахово immediately took the Иловайск . 
according to prisoners in the &quot; boiler &quot; under Иловайском stuck man withstands more than 300 . 
now some survivors admit that if we could turn back the time , карательный battalion that wouldn &apos;t take effect . 
all prisoners be transferred to mass ДНР .

Twitter tried to become more interesting for new users 
service Sitnov Twitter changed the process for registering users to quickly engage new participants in an active interaction with the platform . 
this measure would reduce the number of забросивших their microblogs . 
now , new users of Twitter will see during the registration of a large number of рекоммендованных service accounts , to immediately make their circle of reading . 
the recommendations are based on the registration of interests . 
at the same time , Twitter automatically sets tick on subscriptions for all automatically selected accounts . 
because of this , the user will have to physically remove ticks , not to read those who he is not interesting . 
if earlier users of the service Sitnov saw only аватарки recommended users , now Twitter provides a sample of one popular Tweets from 1979 to help create the impression of a man . 
this is the biggest change in the potential registration of Twitter over the past three years . 
lately Twitter has been actively working on refurbishment service . 
such activity is , first and foremost , with ongoing attempts to service to reach breakeven point . 
in 2014 the service Sitnov faced a slowdown of growth in the user base and a drop in activity . 
the company currently desperately in need of more loyal resource users , which , again , would remain for a long time . 
this is the only way to ensure a steady stream of advertising money .

military ruler and Thai Prime Minister General Прают Чан-Оча announced the composition of a new cabinet of ministers of the country , in which more than a third of posts are generals , or generals in resignation . 
representatives of the army got key posts : ministers of defense , finance , foreign affairs and trade . 
on Monday Прают Чан-Оча was officially confirmed as Prime Minister in the wake of the how the king of Thailand has officially endorsed the appointment as head of the interim military government for the post . 
its 60-year military TV channel in the country as a result of the injury coup on May 22 , was the only candidate for the premiership post . 
he was elected prime minister at a meeting of the parliament . 
earlier the army appointed MPs . 
according to Праютa Чан-Оча , coup was the only way to preserve stability . 
he was held six demonstrations in which protesters have demanded the resignation of the government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra . 
officially Прают Чан-Оча will be temporary prime minister , since the military plan to hold a general election in late 2015 . 
however , there are fears that the military is trying to strengthen his grip on the country . 
the military came to power on May 22 
against a background of complete paralysis of civil authorities . 
leaders of the main political parties were temporary arrest . 
shortly after coming to power , they have temporary arrest of leading politicians , including Prime Minister Йинглык Shinawatra . 
arrested were also some journalists and public figures . 
the current political crisis goes back to 2006 , when the army сместила with premiership brother Йинглык Shinawatra Thaksin . 
they both are popular among rural populations , especially in northern areas of the country that has produced them success in the elections . 
however , many members of the middle class and metropolitan elite entered the terrorism that confronts us movement , which since November 2013 , almost парализовало country . 
nobody was saying that in a salad mussels will be better , I promise you this is not promised , отшучивается the waitress from the new брассерии Palm . 
have to formally recognise that this is indeed the case , but the mind and stomach remain adamant . 
because everyone already knows : we are talking &quot; Belgium &quot; - mean mussels , we say &quot; mussels &quot; mean &quot; Belgium &quot; . 
restaurant operators like глубокомысленно claim that the success of schools depends on three factors : location , location and location . 
there are some places that are not that good , or even excellent , but any невезучие . 
in short , the Palm , I remembered that once there was a cafe &quot; am &quot; ( in honor of the same TV shows ) , then &quot; its , &quot; and even the &quot; Beaujolais &quot; and the forces of &quot; Friends . &quot; 
now here again forces , but no longer ностальгически-советская , but Belgian . 
above ground there is only the tip of the iceberg : cogeneration and a couple of tables , all the rest space without even a hint of sunlight . 
but here , as in a child &apos;s room : red , yellow and green walls , colourful , instead of windows - TVs , where swim девушки-русалки . 
Belgian institution in St. Petersburg for a long time is not a novelty , so compared to before . 
here , eight species of draught beer ( 260-300 rubles ( 0.5 liter ) and countless bottled ( 170-1550 rubles ) . 
Компанейски-позитивная waitress fun Paris menus , telling that &quot; mussels is much bigger seeds , &quot; and it should be noted that , despite some drawbacks , is the positive side of Palm . 
the expected in content , but often very suddenly on execution . 
well , who , for example , predict that the meat with валлонским черносливом ( 280 rubles ) - actually carpaccio , нарезанное besides so subtly that пергаментная paper compared with him seem matter безобразно thick . 
to feel at least some taste only if сгрести time полтарелки . 
with their cause even worse . 
classic льежский ( 260 ) , the more likely it would be to admit a crime against Belgian people : some пожухлый iceberg отваренная once long ago potatoes , раскисшая кенийская beans , одеревенелые chips from bacon plus up marinated onions . 
with such льежским salad don &apos;t want meeting anyone . 
the composition of the ingredients of the Belgian lettuce was partly to others , but it , too , was positive . 
if the недозревшие четвертинки tomatoes cherry tomatoes or пережаренные champignons did you close your eyes , why mussels look like for their life to them a few times managed to freeze and отварить ! 
because I already know : there is quite normal беломорские mussels . 
they served in кастрюльках &quot; sauce on your choice &quot; ( 490-560 rubles per 0.5 kg ) . 
sauces a half-dozen , the one in white wine , celery and carrots , and frankly not Ptolemaios . 
vegetables there , and the aroma is absent , and whether there &apos;s wine , and remained a mystery . 
but good rely to мидиям фриты with home with mayonnaise . 
chicken ватерзой here - not похлебка , thick to such an extent that , depending on mood may decide the first or the second dish before you , but simply pleasant creamy супчик . 
it was announced that a rabbit local chef prepares in beer sauce , and nothing about the rosemary . 
the situation turned out to be diametrically the opposite : rosemary заглушал them all . 
the impression that this rabbit when life fed exclusively розмариновыми кустиками why meat has gained such an extraordinary flavor . 
but the leg rabbit packages of remarkable is not just an excellent pear in карамелизованной crust . 
waffles in Palm offer not only sweet , but also a hearty &quot; with beef , chicken and bacon , and cheese ( 220-280 ) . 
are sauce was unnecessarily водянист and waffles суховаты . 
but подошедшая to fork manager very informally asked Dulo impressions . 
it means that should come again . 
the dollar rose on MICEX above 37 rubles on news about upcoming West new sanctions against Russia . 
it &apos;s a new historical record . 
the dollar calculations &quot; tomorrow &quot; to the 10 : 29 Moscow grew to 26.9 cents and was 37,02 ruble , the euro was raised by 30 kopecks to 48,73 rouble and the Moscow stock market . 
бивалютная basket grew at 28 cents to the level of the previous closing and cost 42,28 ruble . 
before the Crimean events dollar reached peak on February 19 , 2009 - then he cost 36,43 rouble , and on March 3 , 2014 , he was already 37,005 ruble . 
on the night of August 29 , the White House said that President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will discuss any imposition of additional sanctions against Russia . 
the weakening of the ruble is long-term in nature and , in tandem with the euro , and in tandem with the dollar . 
the long-term forecast assumed that mark , &quot; says senior analyst &quot; Alpari &quot; Anna Бодрова . 
all of that has to do with Ukraine , one way or another will be reflected on the courses . 
as long as this continues , investors will react . 
today , rumors about the invading troops are not confirmed nor with one hand , but the market was very emotional . 
all the talk about the fact that he was resistant to such news , yesterday were перечеркнуты . 
this week , according to specialist closes near those levels - 36,90 and 37,05 roubles per dollar . 
the tax period ended , oil prices are weak , a policy of sanctions , the problem of transit of gas through Ukraine are all links in the same chain . 
forecast also accelerates inflation : the current prices for fall by end-2010 from 5 to 10 percent . 
soon , the same end seasonal vegetables and fruits , and there will be a vacuum , so long as the network переориентируются on other suppliers . 
&quot; the dollar went up to 37 roubles , went through it and came back , some powerful hysteria , &quot; said head of analysis of markets &quot; Opening Broker &quot; Konstantin Bushuev . 
still , will look at whether to impose on Saturday promised sanctions , as will meet NATO . 
the ruble , in his words , &quot; severely weakened after the end of tax season , then went to the news on Ukraine , by the same token , the Central Bank last week said that before the end of the year will be transferred to a floating exchange rate and waives any currency interventions . 
if you look at the daytime wobble , then it is no different from the previous ones during this month , all have spooked that mark in 37 rubles , &quot; continued the analyst . 
and so , in terms of turnover nothing powerful never happened . 
worrying times for the currency market were , as I recall when , in late January was an increased demand for the currency , as well as 3rd March , when the Central Bank отгрузил a record number of currency . 
in UFS IC see the positive side of the weakening of the ruble . 
first of all , this increase in the revenue part of the budget from the export operations , as well as to increase the competitiveness of domestic manufacturers at the expense of the expensive imports , says chief analyst UFS IC Alexei Kozlov . 
the negative moments can include prices of imported goods and services . 
sharp fluctuations in the Russian currency to significantly reduce the attractiveness of the investment in the Russian economy , provoke growing inflationary pressures and , as a result , can cause expensive borrowing cash , which , in turn , slows down the development of the economy . 
if we talk about the stock market , the depreciation of the ruble several smoothes over fall in share prices , expressed in roubles . 
for example , the MICEX Index during trading Thursday fell 1.67 percent and the RTS had lost 3.27 percent . 
such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of reduction of indices due to the weakening of the ruble during the day more than 1.5 % . 
the weakening of the ruble is an emotional character and can be explained by a massive desire to buy the currency . 
in practice , gradually emotions go on there , and quotes the ruble partially or fully restore some lost ground . 
&quot; we believe , soon we will be able to see the value of the dollar and the Russian currency near the level of 36 rubles to the dollar , &quot; said Alexei Kozlov . 
a genetic disorder often incorrectly diagnosed 
британка reported that she spent many years thinking that will die after incorrectly delivered the diagnosis . 
Кэрин Rogers spent much of her childhood , thinking that she was left to live only a few years after she was diagnosed with another illness . 
in fact , she had the disease Шарко-Мари-Тута ( ШМТ ) is a group of inherited disorders that cause damage to nerves outside the brain and spine . 
charity CMT UK reported that improperly delayed diagnosis is a common problem among people with ШМТ , because so little is known about this condition . 
with approximately 23,000 people in the UK , presumably , ШМТ , which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness , particularly gait and поджатые your toes . 
sufferers can experience numbness or pain , and the condition is cured only and is progressing , and that means that symptoms worsening with time . 
when Rogers was 13 , she thought that suffers from атаксии Фридрейха ( AF ) -- a condition forecast for which was very bad . 
Rogers thought that she would be прикована confined to a wheelchair by the time she is 18 , and would die before she will turn 30 . 
the mother of two children , now 51 , said : &quot; as a kid , I knew that I couldn &apos;t do what the others . 
each day I fell , and I have all consumed more time . 
I could never go on roller coasters or a skateboard with the other kids , and me a lot of time in school , because , as I went and running . 
Rogers said that , when she was 13 , after several operations to release Health tendon and straighten feet , she needed in medical records , when her doctor went out of the room , and it was written that she AF . 
&quot; I felt guilty , because сунула nose where it should not be , and that &apos;s why I never said , but I returned home , found information about this condition in the library and wrote the AF , &quot; she said . 
when I received the information in reply , I was shocked , and experienced the most terrible panic , and what is merely possible . 
I thought that I would be in a wheelchair for 18 and die before I turn 25 , and that I &apos;ll lose all their abilities in that span . 
I went through it all alone , and I спланировала own funeral . 
she said that by the time she was 17 , she realized that her ability to walk has not deteriorated as much as she thought , and asked about his or her doctor . 
he just stood up and hugged me and said : &quot; my dear , I don &apos;t think that you have this disease , because you would have been in a wheelchair . &quot; 
I think you have something that poses a much smaller threat to life . 
after a few genetic surveys have found ШМТ . 
&quot; when he explained what ШМТ , I thought that positioned her lucky ticket , &quot; she said . 
charity ШМТ Britain announced a month information about ШМТ to try to draw attention to this disease . 
the tax burden on entrepreneurs , the Washington area is growing as the economic recovery 
восстанавливающаяся economy means more customers , the more sales and jobs . 
it also means higher taxes . 
account for taxes on the state and local level for companies across the country , moderately increased in the last year , when an accelerated recovery , according to a new study , published last week , and the company in the Washington area is no exception . 
in the District , Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $ 27.6 billion in the coffers of the state and local level in fiscal 2013 , to 3.8 percent more than the $ 26.6 billion collected in 2012 . 
the tax burden on the state and local level in the past year rose by 4.3 per cent , to $ 671 billion , compared with 3.9 per cent the year before , and it was the third consecutive year of growth after overtaking each other years when account disparities , in 2009 and 2010 . 
taxes , has grown faster , 4.3 percent , than the local taxes , 3.9 percent , according to the study , which was conducted by providing professional services , Ernst &amp; Young and the Center for taxable state group on tax policy . 
more than half of the tax revenue in the county , 56 percent , in taxes on entrepreneurs , while 36 percent of tax revenue Maryland falls on firms . 
Virginia , with 28 percent , is the lowest amount of tax revenue , proportionally , from entrepreneurs . 
to a large extent , the growth in tax revenues caused by returning to the same level of value real estate companies , the researchers say , that raised property taxes by 3.7 per cent this year , after three years in a row , when growth was less than 1 percent . 
while a large proportion of these revenues account for large states , such as California , New York and Texas , it appears that the same thing is happening in the Washington area . 
in the District , Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $ 10 billion property taxes at the state and local level in the past year , to $ 9.6 billion more than in 2012 , an increase of 4.2 per cent , compared with the previous year . 
however , the observed return value of the property does not have a similar effect on the growth of tax revenue for the state and local level in Maryland , where property taxes barely exceed one-fifth of the tax bills of companies . 
company , Virginia and the District of Columbia are paying about half the tax bills on the state and local level , in the form of property taxes . 
&quot; what is happening in Maryland is that such a large part of their property , particularly tax base around the District of Columbia , is owned by either the government or nonprofit organization that does not pay property taxes , &quot; said Douglas Линдхолм , executive director of the Center on taxation . 
thus , Maryland has much more rely , for example , on income taxes to pay for those services that exist in other states . 
the recent increase in tax receipts from businesses cannot fully explain the recovery of the real estate market . 
income entrepreneurs also , it seems , are on the mend , according to this data . 
companies in the region , Chinese corporate income tax at a level of $ 2.3 billion to $ 2.1 billion more than in 2012 . 
Maryland has collected $ 1 billion of corporate income tax , most of all in the region . 
although the trends are aimed in the same direction , the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level did not increase at the same rate in all three areas . 
the level of growth in the District of Columbia was on the same level as the average across the country , 4.3 per cent , while growth in Maryland was significantly faster , 4.9 percent . 
only Virginia has seen the rise of tax revenues below average , equal to 4.1 per cent . 
in Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax from three jurisdictions ( each of which have the same corporate rate ) equal to 6 per cent . 
in Maryland corporate tax rate of 8.25 percent , whereas in the District is relatively high - 9,975 percent . 
a similar study of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that in Virginia , lower taxes for entrepreneurs on the state and local level and , on the whole , a more favorable climate in terms of taxes for entrepreneurs than in Maryland . 
the District has not been evaluated in this study . 
despite his advantage , Virginia is facing competitive pressure from its neighbor to the south . 
North Carolina recently signed a legislative act , reduce corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent , the same as in Virginia , the rate will fall to 5 percent in the next year . 
if the state continues to achieve objectives during the next year , this law could raise the rate of income tax for entrepreneurs , even up to 3 per cent by 2017 . 
meanwhile , a small business in the Washington area , it seems , feels better , and thus pay more taxes at the state and local level , according to a recent study . 
taxes for entrepreneurs , paid in the form of individual income tax the owners of small businesses is a transitional structure , which is constructed , most small firms - in the District of Columbia , Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $ 2.4 billion , with far greater speed than taxes for предпринимателй in general . 
the researchers say that the trend and an increase in revenues from taxes on businesses across the country are likely to persist this year , with the proceeds of the tax on turnover in the governments of the state and local level , from 6.2 per cent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year . 
however Вашингтонская zone can fail , as well as reducing federal spending affects the labor market in the region .

in утешительном final he won a clean victory over бразильцем David Моурой . 
so ended an individual part of the World Championship .

and here is Russian дзюдоисты won doing team silver . 
the most critical opposition they are in stiff competition with a score of 2 or 3 gave the main фаворитам competitions - the team of Japan . 
at the same time , the national team of Russia led 2-0 after a clean victory Хан-Магомедова and volitional - Denis be ( weight to 73 kg ) . 
but in heavier weight categories with their Japanese rivals could not cope Murat Хабачиров ( 81 ) , Magomed Магомедов ( 90 ) and Aslan Камбиев ( 100 ) . 
the same scenario could develop and bronze medal match in the women &apos;s tournament , where the Russian national team , leading , lost японкам - 2-3 . 
in team competitions in Chelyabinsk was attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin , who after the end of the tournament has congratulated the team with silver .

team Russia on the home World Cup performed much better than a year ago , on this level , in Rio de Janeiro . 
then the Russian team had only three medals , one silver and two bronze . 
while the current tournament were Olympic champions Arsene Champions and Mansur Isaev . 
we are all , of course , big максималисты .

especially in a sport like judo , &quot; summarized the results of the tournament , the Minister of Sport Russian Vitaly Mutko at , words which leads to the championship . 
team Japan expected became better in Chelyabinsk , winning 11 medals , five of which were gold .

family Joan Риверз is hoping for the best 
Joan Риверз lies unconscious on arrival at a hospital in New York three days ago , but her daughter expressed hope today that 81-летняя Redeemer actress recover from illness . 
&quot; thank you for your continued love and support , &quot; said Melissa Риверз in a statement today . 
we hope for the best . 
her mother arrived at the hospital Mount Sinai on Thursday after an emergency call that she was stopping heart clinic in Upper Ист-Сайде , Йорквилл Эндоскопи , according to sources . 
doctors were intentionally keeping her sedated and under strict supervision until their would not meet her condition , which remains &quot; difficult . &quot; 
the response was wide , including massive support online from such as Donald Trump , Монтел Williams and Kelly Рипа . 
all can be kings 
the sale &apos;s debut album Royal Blood - the new hope of British rock , выведшей рок-дуэты clubs straight to stadiums . 
the duo Royal Blood all year on the stage , but he already has the nomination on a premium BBC , tour opening Arctic Monkeys and visit гримерку New York concert from the Jimmy right . 
their debut album , Leif even for a few months before release received 100,000 предзаказов and contract on his release lies in the major Warner Music . 
given the current плачевную situation on the music market , the situation of lambasted , because this is not about new Lana del Ray , or regular сладкоголосом representative &quot; of the new R &apos; n &apos; B &apos; , but the duo быковатых on British playing with the level of volume and intensity , that the last time was in vogue two decades ago . 
in general , rates on the first album in connection with all вышеозначенными circumstances were especially high and is already quite justified . 
the duo is not a coincidence that took his name , which previously could prejudice isn &apos;t that quite so desperate hairy metallers and blood which kings flows , how they think , they have in the veins , which is also understandable . 
it is , of course , primarily about the heroes of the past levels of Led Zeppelin , and the great quartet , Royal Blood aim to shake застоявшуюся blood British rock , put it to a new level . 
to make predictions about the success of this enterprise until , perhaps , pretty early , but some say it is already possible . 
a dozen songs , уложившихся thirty , with a few minutes - it &apos;s not so much a demonstration of the phenomenal композиторского gifts , how many Rock and a powerful statement of intent . 
some of the dignity of the individual , of course , deny impossible : for example , a pilot single &quot; Out of the Black &quot; disregards the fact that influential than melodic line , and &quot; party . 
musicians jokingly say that this song in general easier настучать than напеть . 
it should be noted as well as powerful &quot; Little Monster &quot; and will record the song &quot; Better emergency with шекспировской quote in the title . 
but the truth is that each of these songs will be perfectly sound at a party lovers of heavy rock , but when playing in a row they merge into a more or less uniform cloth . 
and this is not necessarily bad , on the contrary . 
the Royal Blood in the fact that they do not claim the new Lennon and McCartney ( rather too mark in successors Motörhead ) , but numerous рок-дуэты from ghetto инди-клубов . 
their music , despite some variety , created for stadiums , indoors , in less than a couple of thousand people , she is obviously closely . 
the secret lies in хитром using bass , took the guitar the usual format , thought at the beginning of the zero The Kicks . 
however , it is not only instruments , but also in the approach to writing songs . 
heroes ретророка zero with great difficulty their outside of postmodern paradigm , with great reluctance , went on to admit himself not just эпигонами and independent creative units . 
Royal Blood is now sound so heavily and boorishly that this pressure successfully драпирует some вторичность and твердолобость musical material . 
Oh , and in the end , who said that the rock must be smart ? 
Amazon is buying it for $ 1.04 billion 
Amazon has just confirmed what said Information on Friday morning : shopping online - and видеопродюсер , and a hundred other things - buys the service streaming видеовоспроизведения it for $ 1.04 billion ( $ US970 million ) . 
the news was a surprise , not because no one expected that it would be sold , and because many people expected that YouTube will be a buyer . 
three months ago , selling it видеосервису Google for good billion looked completely finished , and this combination was a natural . 
it was founded just three years ago as Justin.tv , set a goal to be потоковым service general nature - version of YouTube in real time . 
instead , he quickly became a platform where gamers aired their внутриигровые moments ; &quot; YouTube for games in real-time , &quot; according to Business insider . 
interface it . 
&quot; let &apos;s play , &quot; genre movies , in which всезнайки give ( mainly old ) games , as in &quot; Таинственном theatre &quot; , was already popular on YouTube . 
the fact is that YouTube is mentioned often , when we describe it , so the news that YouTube acquires it was without much interest , a classic example of a deep-rooted technology company выкупающей potential competitor . 
it &apos;s a mystery why deal with YouTube failed , given that , reportedly , he was willing to pay , no less than Amazon . 
all that we have at the moment is a statement from Executive Director it Emmett have : &quot; we chose Amazon because they believe in our community , they share our values and long-term objectives , and they want to help us get there faster . &quot; 
another mystery , frankly , it is an incredible success it is . 
снобам like me , who say they would rather exercise than watching him , it is difficult to understand the attraction to watch the games instead of himself to pick up a joystick . 
it is one thing to look over his shoulder at 3 a.m. , while creeping through the resident Evil , and it is another to look like some sort of an outsider man gets 20 shots in the head in a row as Call of Duty . 
all of the games that you could watch right now . 
another problem is that many of the most popular today games are designed for one person , so I watch them shoot , not controlling the angle of view , can be a recipe for a headache , a worthy Do It Right . 
I agree that high-speed transmission , in which Роджеры Бэннистеры of our electronic age completing the whole game in record time , entertain . 
but if we are not talking about виртуозе games or humor , it &apos;s unlikely that his channel it altogether will be interesting . 
but what they know skeptics like me ? 
there it is 55 million unique visitors per month , and it is the fourth largest source of peak Internet traffic . 
how Amazon works on this ? 
it is hard to imagine that it свернется in Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube would simply absorb it . 
but it is a fact that gladly would have received any company : the crowd of young men , of whom dream of advertisers . 
both said it Шир , Amazon and it is &quot; both believe in the future of gaming , &quot; and the channel has signs , even &quot; ouch &quot; as a kind of sport . 
as a result of what happened in 2004 , the attack killed more than 330 people , including 186 children . 
more than 800 people were injured . 
we spent in Beslan for several days . 
we talked to surviving hostages - nearly all are now students , with parents of dead , a cemetery &quot; City of Angels &quot; cult Касполатовым , head of the Committee of the &quot; Mothers of Beslan &quot; Сусанной Dudiyeva who participated in a special operation , an Emergency Situations Ministry , says correspondent of &quot; Society &quot; Elizabeth Antonova , serving over спецпроектом . 
already after returning to Moscow , met with Асламбеком Аслахановым , who 10 years ago was an adviser to the president of the North Caucasus and negotiating with terrorists , as well as with the officer , &quot; This &quot; Russian FSB Vyacheslav Бочаровым . &quot; 
what I am particularly shocked during work on this topic is that in Beslan as if it were not for these ten years . 
this issue is extremely painful for everyone who has some to her attitude , people hardly agree to talk about what happened . 
the travel experience is very heavy . 
but forget the Beslan cannot , and I hope , with its task we have , &quot; said Antonova . 
so prepared animated infographics holding Rambler &amp; Co , which operates in the spring of this year . 
previous спецпроекты were dedicated to World War I and the 15th-anniversary Vladimir Putin . 
North Korea conducted the launch short-range 
North Korea made the launch short-range in into the Sea of Japan , according to &quot; Ренхап . &quot; 
the launch was about 10.30 a.m. local time from the province of Чагандо , located on the border between North Korea and China . 
presumably , the missile fell into the Sea of Japan , in short order , 220 km , as stated in the Joint Committee of the chiefs of staff of South Korea . 
MPs have proposed to accelerate the entry into force of the law on personal data 
in the case of the success of the initiative , the Russians cannot be stored on servers abroad from January 1 , 2015 
the Russian parliament introduced a draft law providing for postponing the date of entry into force have already adopted the law on the personal data of Russians - from 1 September 2016 , on January 1 , 2015 . 
the initiative is available in the legislative activities of the lower chamber . 
its authors were the deputies of the State Duma Vadim Деньгин , Yaroslav Nilov has informed about ( LDPR ) , Evgeny Fyodorov ( United Russia ) , Vladimir Парахин ( &quot; Just Russia &quot; ) and Alexander Yushchenko ( KPRF ) . 
such a change , according to the authors of the initiatives that will contribute to more operational and effective to ensure the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation on the safety of personal data or the secrecy of correspondence in информационно-телекоммуникационных networks . 
the law , entry into force which торопят parliamentarians , commits to store the personal data of Russians , run through the Internet . 
he also makes mandatory recording , systematized , accumulation , storage , and the extraction of personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation , in the databases , which are located on the territory of Russia , as well as indication of information about the location of such databases . 
in addition , the law gives Roskomnadzor law on the basis of a court decision to restrict access to information being processed in violation of the laws of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data . 
the law also proposes the creation of a so-called &quot; black lists &quot; сайтов-нарушителей - an automated information system &quot; Register violators of human rights of personal data . &quot; 
this law was passed by the State Duma in the summer . 
the authors of the bill were Andrei Lugovoy and Vadim Деньгин from the Liberal Democratic Party ( LDPR ) and Alexander Yushchenko from the Communist Party . 
Деньгин and Yushchenko are also one of the authors of the current draft of the date of entry into force has already adopted a law . 
those data centers in Russia , there is no need to pay the rent 
commenting on draft today in the State Duma a bill first deputy head Duma Committee on information policy , Leonid Levin , said that he sees no problems for the date of the entry into force of the Law on the protection of personal data . 
he said that those companies that by 1 January 2015 , will have their own storage of personal data of Russians on the territory of the Russian Federation , will be able to rent them , for example , &quot; the Rostelecom , who have repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their own servers in rent and already provides its own servers , Mail Group , Western companies that now provide their servers . &quot; 
&quot; in addition , there are several independent data centers , ready to cooperate in this area , &quot; he added . 
&quot; if companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work in the territory of the Russian Federation , I don &apos;t see problems - they will have the technological capability to host , &quot; concluded Levine . 
controversial bill 
immediately after publication of the draft law , the Russian Association of Electronic Communications had concerns that , in the event the Russians will no longer be able to use many global database . 
in particular , we are talking about services online airline tickets and hotels . 
according to the association , &quot; the bill deprives subjects of personal data : citizens of the Russian Federation to control their own data tell determining that their recording , systematisation , etc . , must be provided only in the databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation . &quot; 
in a statement РАЭК stressed that a more effective measure would create a mechanism to inform users about where is the recording , systematisation of his personal data . 
in this case , he will be able to choose , on which areas will be made of these actions . 
the adoption of similar such bills about &quot; containment &quot; of personal data in other countries has led to the establishment of global services and significant economic losses .

cunning ways to save on university textbooks 
the fact that the cost of university textbooks for many students more than $ 1000 a year , Matt Schroeder , who will soon move to the second course , came up with an ingenious way to reduce costs . 
he developed a system of how to borrow books the старшекурсников , offering them rated compensation that they delayed their sale . 
&quot; my textbook on mathematical analysis , which typically costs $ 180 , which I got for a semester for $ 10 and biscuits &quot; Chick-fil-A &quot; , &quot; says Schroeder , 19 , who is studying in Ковенант College in Georgia . 
the literature on last semester cost would be $ 430 , he says . 
he spent $ 120 . 
according to the Council of the colleges , the average student spends $ 1,200 a year on books and supplies , but the students have a number of options to reduce these costs . 
students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas , such system Schroeder . 
rent books is becoming increasingly popular , allowing students to use a book during the semester , and often costing substantially cheaper than buying them . 
&quot; Нибо Инкорпорейтид &quot; , which holds more than 250 university bookstores , reports that the volume of rental books grew by half since 2011 . 
research industry show that nearly a quarter of books in university bookstores during the past spring semester were taken , said the vice president &quot; Нибо &quot; Trevor Meyer . 
fewer than half of all books sold in university bookstores , according to the professional union , the National Association of Choirs shops . &quot; 
here &apos;s introductory course on the best ways to make a great deal . 
purchase in store 
sometimes , if you will connect to the Internet , the price of a new book could constitute one third of that , what you will see in the university bookstore . 
the ninth edition of &quot; Mathematical Analysis , &quot; Ron Larson ’ s Bruce Edwards and Robert Хостетлера worth about $ 290 privately , but a copy can be purchased for $ 239,99 site Chegg.com , which specialises in selling textbooks . 
buying подержанного 
if you don &apos;t mind other people &apos;s notes or injuries , second-hand textbooks are a good option . 
&quot; mathematical analysis &quot; sold for $ 93,49 in подержанном to Chegg.com. 
Matt Кэсэдей , 25 , a student of the fourth course at the University of Бригэм Young , said that paid on Amazon.com 42 cents for a secondhand copy of the textbook &quot; strategic decisions in the media : an understanding of the business side of the advertising business . &quot; 
the book sold for $ 48 . 
teachers , for instance , Ingrid Брейси , director of &quot; College without walls &quot; at the University of Massachusetts in Эмхерсте , offers students refine their professors , not whether to use previous editions . 
sometimes the updates are insignificant for classes . 
in such cases , the old editions can often be found in a very small fraction of the cost of the latest edition . 
in addition to the websites , Chegg , Amazon and Half.com , &quot; eBay Inc . , is a popular alternative to buying second-hand books . 
hire 
about to take textbooks to hire , you need to think , if you &apos;re well enough with them , don &apos;t forget to return them and don &apos;t want to leave them yourself after that is completed the course . 
you can save more than 80 % of the cost of a new book . 
for example , a student could rent a &quot; Математический analysis &quot; for a semester for about $ 20 . 
check the rules before the store , where you take the books , including any fines that you can write the notes , underscore and damage . 
if you take a book rental , remember : if you don &apos;t give the book , fines may even exceed the cost of the new instance . 
electronic books 
electronic books instead of traditional textbooks is another option . 
sometimes such books actually take Geran , acquiring electronic license for a certain period for retailers , such as Amazon.com , Chegg and Barnes &amp; Noble Inc . 
hire &quot; Mathematical Analysis &quot; on the site Chegg.com for six months will cost about $ 61 . 
Брейси says that students who study literature , can often find the most advantageous prices , as many of the classics are free , whereas literature on natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive . 
no matter what , осмотритесь . 
Joe Who , 29 , who will begin their studies in Thirteen Пеппердин , recommends that you use the commissions to investigate the price of the book , as it ensures that you are looking for precisely the right you text . 
but before you order online , &quot; says Who , be sure to check whether a book is in stock . 
for him the lesson Hemsedal is not easy . 
the delivery of the books , which he bought , was postponed for four weeks , and , in the end , he paid the full price at the university bookstore . 
Putin said that the inefficiency of fund development of the Far East 
Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin зявил at a meeting on the state priority investment projects and territories in the Far East , and Islamic investment fund development of the Far East , founded two years ago , inefficient , according to Interfax . 
&quot; 15 billion rubles and remained on the deposits , &quot; said the president . 
during the meeting , the head of state asked to speed up approval of the list of territories of advancing in the Far East . 
he said that the law needed to establish a ТОРов should be included in the State Duma this fall . 
the federal assembly , said the president , before July 1 , has not approved the list of territories of advancing in the Far East , and their criteria . 
Vladimir Putin also formulated the basic tasks to ensure the development of the Far East . 
among them , improving transport in the region , removing infrastructure restrictions - on both the domestic market and for export . 
among other things , requires создатьпредпосылки to attract in the region of additional investments , as well as to the advancing , which should be competitive in relation to the key business centres of the Asia-Pacific region , &quot; said the president . 
it was previously reported that the advancing may replace the SEZ . 
why &quot; Revolutionary galaxies &quot; would not have been able to save cash 
&quot; Неудержимые 3 &quot; Сильвестра Stallone returned less than $ 30 million from his $ 90-миллионного budget in the United States , while &quot; City of sins : the woman is a challenge to kill &quot; returned only $ 12 performance from his $ 70-миллионного budget . 
&quot; home video &quot; with Cameron Diaz brought only $ 14.6 million in its first weekend , while children &apos;s movies , such as &quot; How to them quite effortlessly Dragon 2 &quot; also had record revenue . 
Article кинокритика Telegraph Robbie Collina indicates that , when it comes to children &apos;s films , perhaps as bad as the movies . 
Collin called 2014 &quot; the worst &quot; year in history in terms of children &apos;s films , and called &quot; How to them quite effortlessly Dragon 2 &quot; barely &quot; full-fledged &quot; continuing installation . 
however , when it comes to movies aimed at an audience of a few older , it seems that the problem does not necessarily consist in the movies . 
in July , Entertainment Weekly compared average ratings CinemaScore and Metacritic of every film , in a summer of at least 2,000 copies between holiday Memorial Day in May and 20 July , 2013 and this year . 
results , which take into account the opinion as кинозрителей and кинокритиков , suggests that the crop of films this year are similar to exceed last year &apos;s hits . 
some commentators suggest that things may be changing Audience habits and the growing popularity of streaming Internet services , such as Netflix . 
director John , who is currently working on soon coming to hire диснеевским film &quot; The Book of the jungle , &quot; said the website Hollywood Reporter : &quot; I think times are changing . &quot; 
we should admit it and not try to chase what it was before . 
in contrast to the current drop in impairment in Hollywood , Netflix from service streaming playback reached $ 1.2 billion , almost double killer Open Source revolution figure of $ 837 million . 
last summer , the director Steven Spielberg criticized studios for what they too rely on the franchise &apos;s comic book , and predicted a &quot; collapse &quot; of Hollywood . 
in the light of the current recession , some commentators argue that in its bleak предсказаниях was some truth . 
due to the fact that in the summer of 2015 is expected to be out several potential cash hits , including &quot; Мстителей : era Альтрона , &quot; &quot; Миньонов &quot; and &quot; the opposition National Park , &quot; the other representatives of the industry of cinema are more optimistic . 
the producer of &quot; People X &quot; Simon Кинберг recently called the fall box office numbers simply &quot; цикличным &quot; , telling the Hollywood Reporter : &quot; next summer will be the most cash in the summer in history , and nobody would worry about it . &quot; 
food sanctions do not frighten the owners of establishments with the Caucasian and Central Asian food , but for the larger European and Japanese cuisine Russian suppliers is a dream . 
and on the whole catering still prefers to replace blocked imports of products not from Russia but from Latin America , Israel and China . 
&quot; better have малосольный cucumber than bad моцареллу , &quot; laments a chef of Italian restaurants Barlotti with the name Mariano transfer over the quality of the cheeses that offer him suppliers to replace the Italian . 
mozzarella and a cheese буррата ran out in the first , they have a shelf-life . 
stocks пармезана should last for another couple of months . 
what to do ? 
switch to a Russian ? 
in 2005 I was at Дорогомиловском market . 
with the name Mariano transfer makes such eyes , that clearly : shocking memories not released it so far . 
meat there lay on carts just 30 inches from the floor . 
the cat ! 
rats ! 
then I said to our restaurant we never will buy the Russian markets . 
I don &apos;t know , maybe now there is not enough time for that . 
but the other day I brought to sample fish from the Far East . 
so she was тухлой ! 
I said that I speak to don &apos;t want the person who we brought . 
transfer wonders that many ordinary for Italy things for the Russian manufacturer in restraint . 
a few years ago , I was forced to buy the beef . 
in Italy dogs are the meat in the refrigeration chamber for 10 days at a temperature of 2 degrees . 
it must отвисеться to become soft , to muscle расслабились . 
I did all of this with the local beef . 
then I asked : &quot; where have you taken such a delicate meat ? 
I said : &quot; so it &apos;s you , Russia ! 
why have you nobody does not do so ? 
in five minutes &apos; walk from Barlotti French restaurant &quot; Brasserie The Bridge &quot; in the kitchen hangs a stop list , in which are listed missing products : French oysters , .............. . 
the chef &apos;s &quot; Brasserie The Bridge &quot; and &quot; Strelka &quot; Режис Тригель not so pessimistic configured as transfer : oysters from France has already replaced oysters from Tunisia , and instead of French cheese restaurant will buy Swiss . 
however , Режис becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers : &quot; cauliflower is 200 roubles . 
I ask : &quot; why , on what basis it so worth it ? &quot;

санкционное menu 
on 6 August , President Vladimir Putin signed a decree applying specific economic measures to ensure the security of Russia , which is basically food sanctions . 
the country banned import of beef , pork , meat and offal names from poultry , meat , fish , shellfish , milk , yogurt , cheese , cheese , vegetables , fruit , nuts , sausage and sugar syrups . 
the restaurants began jockeying seems with suppliers : food prices have increased , we must urgently seek counterparts from other countries . 
more likely it will have an impact on expensive restaurants with монокухней France , Italy , Spain , in which products supplied directly from &quot; motherships &quot; countries . 
общепиту had activities and earlier . 
for example , when , at the beginning of 2014 , the Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef , and the year before - the American and Canadian meat . 
in return , the suppliers have supplies of beef from Argentina , Uruguay and New Zealand . 
but sanctions лета-2014 proved to be far more serious . 
however , on August 20 , Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the president &apos;s decree , which lifted the ban fry Atlantic salmon and trout , безлактозное milk , seed potatoes , sugar corn , peas and onions for replanting . 
the Italian transfer hopes that sanctions might still смягчиться . 
in the meantime , some restaurants exists under conditions of uncertainty . 
according to the company &apos;s &quot; East-West &quot; , one of the largest suppliers of world , the proportion of imported products in the premium segment accounted for up to 70 % . 
&quot; expensive restaurants may change menus under that produce local farmers and other countries , &quot; says Sergei Mironov , another , owner of the agency &quot; Рестконсалт . &quot; 
if the strong , for him it &apos;s not going to be a problem . 
but we have very little of these cooks , and the development of new menu items may take two to three months . 
Тригель from the restaurant &quot; Brasserie The Bridge &quot; to it ready : refuse will be between 10-15 per cent of dishes , even half of the menu - recycle . 
in restaurants with a kitchen are starting to replace dishes , for example steak from marble beef - on бефстроганов , says Sergei Mironov . 
&quot; cheeses from Europe can be replaced with Russian , Belarusian cheeses and cheeses from Serbia , Argentina , Tunisia , Chile , &quot; lists the &quot; East-West &quot; Oksana Глибчук . 
cream and milk products from Europe have counterparts in Russia and Belarus . 
chicken from the United States may be replaced by a chicken from Russia and Belarus , salmon and park from Norway - salmon , семгой , surrounded from Belarus and Chile . 
the absence of vegetables and fruits of European production may be at the expense of domestic manufacturers , proposals from Serbia , Moldova and China . 
according to Mironov , budgetary network restaurants re-build will be easier than премиальному segment : unlikely there went the Reeperbahn , able to distinguish between the Italian моцареллу from Russian . 
although it is difficult to have institutions Ginza Project , he says . 
the Ginza Project a few dozen restaurants under different brands and with their own menu . 
the replacement will take plenty of time , &quot; said Mironov . 
in Ginza comment refused , citing the lack of owners in the country . 
the owners of Café Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine stress that products from the former Soviet republics ароматнее European 
but a lot and restaurants , which sanctions almost never affected . 
these include schools with kitchen CIS : Georgian , Uzbek , Armenian and Azerbaijani . 
&quot; the Georgian kitchen no expensive products , &quot; says Хатуна Колбая , owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and cafes &quot; Vai мэ ! . &quot; 
all cheeses for us to do in Russia , the basis of many dishes - chicken fillets , exotic herbs we don &apos;t use . &quot; 
in establishments Колбаи until removed from the menu of a single cuisine . 
Timur colon , owner of the restaurants &quot; high-born N1 &quot; with Uzbek cuisine , sanctions also might alert : change he will have only sausages on новозеландскую . 
if Russia our owned imports from Uzbekistan , Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan , we even win in price , for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe , &quot; he says . 
from the CIS can be cheaper to get engineering , sausages , tomatoes , cucumbers , fruit . 
at the same time , what brought from Central Asia , far better than &quot; plastic &quot; from Italy , Spain and Turkey . 
the Uzbek tomatoes all know that they are tasty , sweet . 
the Spanish one never says . 
after the sanctions representative Минсельводхоза Uzbekistan Олимбой Артыков said that plans to increase export плодовоовощной products in Russia doubled by 2016 . 
of its intention to replace the European imports in Russia almost immediately after the sanctions said Belarus and Kazakhstan . 
restaurants now that responded to the request &quot; &apos;s &quot; , is also quite calmly respond to sanctions . 
the McDonald &apos;s said that localization exceeds 85 per cent , and the network is working with 160 Russian suppliers . 
according to Tatyana Богдановой , head of the department for work with suppliers in public areas , about 80 % of the food network buys in Russia , although there may be temporary difficulties with supplies of vegetables and increased prices for meat products that produce from the imported raw materials . 
in &quot; Теремке &quot; санкционные foods &quot; generally have no more than 4 % . 
not affected by sanctions and лапшичную &quot; Воккер . &quot; 
KFC , Burger King and &quot; Крошка Картошка &quot; on request &quot; &apos;s &quot; not answered , but other market participants said that the degree of localization of Burger King is substantially less than the McDonald &apos;s . 
in the absence of Norwegian fish restaurant operators are willing to buy more чилийскую than Russian glad to present you our excellent 
at its горбуше 
in the meantime , restaurant operators complain that because of increasing demand , prices are rising even on local products . 
&quot; on products for &quot; sticking points &quot; prices increased on average by 10-15 % , for the Italian restaurant &quot; Cherry M &amp; E &quot; - twice , &quot; says another Roman Рожниковский . 
even in the Georgian restaurants the dishes will grow by 5-10 % , concedes Колбая . 
&quot; East-West &quot; didn &apos;t deny , &quot; for example , the Belarusian milk products since August prices by 10-15 percent . &quot; 
&quot; Brazilian suppliers raised prices for pork twice , &quot; complains Sergei Cancer , deputy director general of &quot; Стардогс . &quot; 
legs chicken rose by 35 % . 
expect prices from China , maybe they остудят hot Brazilian head . 
in the near future in &quot; Стардогсе &quot; will be planned to increase prices by 8 % . 
now , and so very undesirable to raise prices , &quot; says Cancer . 
according to statistics , the increase in revenues was catering for the second quarter of 2014 , just 1.8 % . 
this is the smallest rate since 2010 . 
retail prices will rise further , he admits , but it is unclear how quickly : while most restaurateurs запаслось products over the next two months , hoping to wait out their purchase prices . 
but that would be two months , nobody knows . 
on the square in front of the city hall of Moscow is worth a dozen places , greenery and trees . 
in the center of the stage , the musicians play a waltz . 
it is a festival of regional products with a funny name &quot; there is time there . &quot; 
&quot; we generally have long wanted to do a celebration of local food , and then just sanctions , we поторопились , organized the festival , &quot; said one of the organizers . 
behind the scenes with the musicians повар-грек Анастас prepares salad of pasta and homemade candy , the other day was a master class on the cooking of the British Library карамелизированными apples . 
all of Russian products that assure the organisers . 
in tents - the achievements of the Russian economy . 
honey from Bashkiria , venison from Salekhard , vegetables from outside Moscow &quot; Совхоза named Lenin , &quot; cheeses from обрусевшего Italian &apos;s Jay Клоуза . 
&quot; salmon for restaurants , you can easily substitute other fish salmon species from the Far East , &quot; says the owner of the fish shop &quot; his people &quot; Philip Galkin . 
we are catching нерку it , and горбушу , is &quot; royal salmon . &quot; 
yes , they are not as fat as the Norwegian salmon , because it is wild fish . 
Norwegian salmon is the same aquaculture . 
his hands nowadays - he doesn &apos;t even stirs . 
and our Asia Pacific salmon are in the hands do not retain . 
only institutions without special claims agree to replace the Italian моцареллу domestic 
in the window of his шатра lie prawns with биркой &apos; Magadan &apos; , cod , Square , муксун , mussels with Crimea , a manager with the Far East . 
Galkin is confident that it is time to move on fish from the Far East . 
according to statistics , fishing in Russia in 2013 - more than 4 million tons , a substantial portion of fish goes to Japan , Korea and even in the United States . 
imports of fish in 2013-м - about 800,000 tonnes . 
shop &quot; his people &quot; working in 2012 , sells fish through the online store , before sanctions served another half dozen restaurants , such as &quot; Simple things . &quot; 
now the Галкину received bids from 15 restaurants . 
the same land mass could be done from our fish , &quot; горячится he . 
we заморочились , try different recipes . 
now sushi sell through online store per million roubles a month . 
our fish cheaper in a few times , and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram . 
the confirmation of the tent bears me prepare a portion of &quot; Philadelphia &quot; with кетой . 
unlike the rolls with семгой these have longer chew , but knowing that this fish our native , adds . 
on the website of the shop &quot; his people &quot; have even note from палтуса and sea-bass . 
in суши-барах , however , replace the Norwegian salmon prefer Chilean . 
Galkin explains that поварам laziness inventing new recipes with the Far East fish . 
&quot; the Russian fish suppliers we haven &apos;t offered , &quot; gives its explanation owner Killfish Bar Dmitri Evseev . 
about the same situation with other products : Russian producers would take the vacant niche , but it doesn &apos;t happen . 
according to the founder and co-owner of project LavkaLavka Boris Sirota , now we can talk about eliminating ozone imports from Europe and America imports from China , Israel and Latin America . 
there are large multinational corporations , which have a powerful logistics and big volumes . 
they can quickly replace blocked imports , in contrast to our farmers . 
the ban will benefit primarily large manufacturers in other countries , &quot; says Akimov . 
however , in the past month ресторанная industry received more alarming than food sanctions . 
according to the results of the massive supplementary audits Rospotrebnadzor was temporarily suspended work three plants McDonald &apos;s in Moscow and two regional businesses in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg . 
&quot; we are studying the essence of claims claims to determine the actions necessary to open the restaurants for visitors , &quot; said &quot; Деньгам &quot; in McDonald &apos;s . 
no one really knows what will happen . 
if everyone limited food sanctions , this is one way that you can survive , &quot; he said on condition of anonymity at the company restaurant consulting . 
if you begin to close the McDonald &apos;s across the country , the scenario is completely different . 
&quot; европротокол &quot; instead of help traffic 
payments on the non will receive no help traffic - so the Central Bank intends to stimulate the implementation in Russia &quot; европротокола . &quot; 
the Bank of Russia has developed the draft guidance , according to which , on 1 September this year to receive payments on the non застрахованный when you can do it without help . 
this , however , is only about cases where the accident was framed by &quot; европротоколу &quot; without the participation of the traffic police . 
that is when the accident took place only two cars , there is no physically affected persons , damage does not exceed the limit and both drivers have reached a consensus on who the culprit of the accident . 
with the August 2 limit payments on &quot; европротоколу &quot; is 50,000 roubles , and as from 1 October in Moscow , St Petersburg and in the Moscow and Leningrad areas he will be increased to 400 thousand rubles . 
the point is that sometimes , even with minor damage , in a situation where an accident can be on &quot; европротоколу &quot; drivers trapped in an accident , causing Smith . 
because if the policyholder non to obtain the refund without Help STSI was impossible . 
parameters laid out in the draft guidelines , designed to eliminate this obstacle in the way of implementing &quot; европротокола &quot; in Russia . 
according to them , the maximum payout for non in connection with the accident , without the police , must not be lower than the limit on &quot; европротоколу . &quot; 
but at the same time , it may not be , and above the limit specified in the contract of insurance non . 
the idea , of course , useful and theoretically capable of relieving both employees of Smith and roads . 
but , most likely , it will not come to the delight neither motorists nor insurers . 
the past is now talking about the serious threat of fraud , which can result in the introduction of new rules in the non . 
as for the drivers , it &apos;s hard to imagine what kind of work will have to be done to overcome as a Russian conservatism . 
the driver , in the majority of cases would be hours to wait for the inspectors to make minor accident , because the lock . 
and it remains to be seen what will be simpler - beat swindlers or convince drivers in reliability &quot; европротокола . &quot; 
savings certificate will be registered and irrevocable offer 
the Finance Ministry wants to block savings certificates to the bearer , but will allow banks to do their analogue безотзывного contribution . 
the Finance Ministry is preparing a bill that would prohibit savings certificates to the bearer . 
lately , this tool is gaining popularity , as rates here are higher than on bank deposits . 
the fact is that savings certificates on bearer does not fall into a system of deposit insurance and bank they are cheaper because they don &apos;t have to make payments to the Fund Deposit Insurance Agency ( pointed out ) . 
successfully situation in the fact that this step will be taken because of the small and medium-sized banks , spreading such certificates , and suffer from Sberbank and Bank of Moscow , which , according to estimates pointed to control 98 % of the level of the market . 
with the Bank of Moscow , according to the agency , which is about 3.5 % . 
the problem , explains the pointed out , is that the customers of a bank that bought such a certificate , in case of withdrawal he had license to try to get money into pointed out . 
some depositors , not having sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates to the bearer , may assume that their investment is insured . 
informed the absence of insurance payouts on those certificated in case of license revocation the bank can lead to misunderstandings and social tensions . 
in practice , the agencies were cases when holders предъявительских certificates to seek indemnities through the court , &quot; he said in a pointed out . 
the problem , of course , made-up . 
for paying customers of certificates still nobody will , as they have under the law has no right to compensation from the State . 
if the case was that the instrument is insured in pointed , together with him banned would and metal accounts , which means citizens are in grams of one of four metals : gold , silver , platinum and palladium . 
since these accounts do not fall into a system of deposit insurance , but their existence until nobody deprives . 
it is likely that the bearer is very convenient , certifying that actually can act in the role of квазиденег . 
at the same time , their movements is not amenable to control : any bank customer can buy a certificate to every citizen , and to putting this certificate can change a lot of owners . 
it is no coincidence that the draft that savings certificate must be issued in a valuable paper , which must be stored in depositories . 
and that ’ s one banks such certificates be permitted to manufacture without the right to early repayment . 
we have introduced similar безотзывного contribution , which has long been a dream of the bankers .

according to available data , this has happened to the ferry Gulf near settlements Широкино and Безыменное ( 10-20 km east of Mariupol .

met two Union 
the talks at the highest level in Minsk has not solved the problems for which they were called back , but has also produced a new format : the first face of the European Union met with the chief executives of a future Eurasian 
let the disturbing drift about ( the situation around Ukraine отлагательств does not tolerate ) , the leaders of the EU and Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of &quot; hot issues . &quot; 
it is capable of such a structure to work effectively , it is not clear ; but it is clear who took the cream from that summit . 
questions on this one evening on August 26 , when the Belarusians , and after them and other евразийцы with Europeans saw change the new President Lukashenko . 
the Belarusian leader revealed example отточенной учтивости , it was the behavior of a man who had just caught the jackpot - and is planning a decent old age in high society . 
as Maidan Lukashenko helped 
the arrival in Minsk just three main European commissioners ( of the EU ) , who met with Mr. Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf -- not just легитимация president for the past 20 years . 
this is an application for recognition of a full-fledged subject of European policy , and a major campaign of the Ukrainian crisis . 
a senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Studies Denis Мельянцов sure : from now on , Brussels can &apos;t already speak with Minsk in the same tone as before . 
&quot; what Catherine Ashton met face to face with Lukashenko , gives reason to believe that the relationship with the EU will be размораживаться and beyond , &quot; he said &quot; Огоньку . &quot; 
the debates have hidden part : prepare for the breakthrough , the Belarusian authorities have begun well before November Maidan in Kiev - summer 2013-го . 
&quot; had achieved results and with the EU &apos;s successful negotiations for the simplification of the visa regime and readmission , dialogues about modernization , &quot; lists interlocutor of Ogonyok which -- and with the United States have held talks on international security . 
States even took a little bit of sanctions . 
as regards the Ukrainian events , then they themselves and the response to guide Belarus only invoked another influx this process . 
Minsk , on the one hand , managed to preserve relations with Ukraine are fairly warm , so not much to lose in mutual trade , and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for talks . 
on the other hand , the Belarusian leader , de jure not recognized the annexation of Crimea by Russia and urged to punish pro-Russian militia-men in Donbas with all severity , not quarreled with Moscow . 
Minsk has not released any of the Customs Union , nor from the Collective Security Treaty Organization , but sometimes it is the Russian air base . 
Brussels and Washington have noticed a balanced position of Minsk to the Ukrainian issue - and appreciated her confident Belarusian experts . 
how successful will the movement Lukashenko to a policy of diversification , will be seen by how often in the near future , Minsk доведется take meetings in the format of the EU + TC . 
the press office of the EU High Representative for foreign policy and diplomacy Catherine Ashton failed to answer questions about what Brussels wants from the relationship in a new format . 
a spokesman for Ashton Maya Косьянчич only said &quot; Огоньку &quot; that on matters of war and peace , this issue is not a priority . 
at the same time , there are reports that following a meeting on the Ukraine issue , with the participation of the people in the new format may be , and Kazakhstan . 
a drop of tar in Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev , in which he admitted that about him , it turns out , personally asked representatives of the European Union . 
nevertheless , at the final briefing Alexander Lukashenko made it clear : all sides are not opposed to Minsk remained a central platform for meetings , both in format Россия--ОБСЕ--Украина , and at the level of Heads of State and high representatives of the European Commission . 
this means that &quot; the last dictator in Europe &quot; becomes a quite рукопожатного European leader who helps solve a global problem . 
the best friend of the European farmer 
already the delegation , which included еврокомиссаров on trade and energy , pushed to the conclusion : the main underlying reason for the summit -- not the tragic situation in the Donbas , and economy . 
in fact , сверстанное meeting schedule future talks on the gas supply and to overcome the fear of the CU in agreement about the association between Ukraine and the EU looks like an achievement and more extensive than peace declaration without specific dates and numbers . 
Trade Commissioner Karl De Гюхт , nevertheless , fax : EU officials &quot; arrived in Minsk seek solution to the political crisis which has economic consequences , and not vice versa . &quot; 
it seems , however , that the economic crisis in Ukraine &quot; works &quot; in Belarus . 
its consequences - and above all reciprocal sanctions imposed by the West and Russia - give Minsk , who until he feels санкционное pressure , with room for maneuver . 
according to the leader of the Research Center of Mises , Belarus Yaroslav Ramanchuk , European investors are actively interested in opportunities to Belarus to supply agricultural products to the Russian Federation in bypassing sanctions . 
the nominated delivery scheme , for which President Vladimir Putin at the summit пожурил Minsk . 
&quot; billions of these schemes , &quot; said Romanchuk &quot; Огоньку , &quot; are not the Belarusian businessmen and Russian companies . 
they have long worked on a scheme of supplies of goods , including from Poland , Germany , Lithuania , and today these schemes were destroyed . 
Russian businesses urgently need to somehow restore them , even through the mediation of the Belarusian authorities . 
the second story , &quot; continued expert , is connected with the fact that many Ukrainian companies are not away to Belarus from the raw materials as well as focusing on the Russian market . 
the Ukrainian producers about $ 4 billion of exports to Russia , and the Belarusian производственно-торговые scheme now could prove very popular . &quot; 
according to Ramanchuk , the role of the host site for the negotiations between the EU and the TC is ideal for Lukashenko and from the point of view of the development of economic ties with Europe . 
he recalls that the loss of the agricultural sector of EU sanctions against Moscow are estimated at 5-10 billion euros , and the Commission is currently proposed аграриям only 125 million euros in compensation . 
the Belarusian president could offer to Brussels to work together to minimise the consequences for еврофермеров . 
this could raise the authority of Lukashenko to the EU to unprecedented heights . 
hospitality without initiatives 
Catherine Ashton thanked the authorities for the initiative for the summit . 
but the paradox is that the Minsk from his active role in birth format TS + EU открещивается , and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with Ukrainian counterpart emphasized that the new format and it was Kiev . 
&quot; it was your suggestion to come without навала discuss , not with бухты-барахты decide , after the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU , to sort out the situation , which at the time was in Ukraine , &quot; he remonstrated before the cameras to Peter Poroshenko . 
however , observers interpreted it as an attempt to calm Moscow , she had , according to rumor , was initially against the intermediation of Minsk , which greatly increases his political weight . 
in Belarusian diplomatic establishment try to stress that Belarus when organising cooperation between the EU and the TA on their soil did not pursue a lucrative target , but the ultimate goal of this format is to create in the future , a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok . 
&quot; this is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts which , in other areas , in particular in the field of security , proposes and promotes the leadership of our strategic ally , the Russian Federation , &quot; said &quot; Огоньку &quot; at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus , the agency , which recently vigorously into words . 
in Moscow may appear zone to close 
the government of Moscow considers the option of introducing zones to close as a method of combating year central roads by analogy with other major cities around the world , sends М24.ru citing заммэра Moscow on matters of transport , Maxim Ликсутова . 
one option , which has proven itself a surcharge entry . 
it is the expert opinion , it is understood , look at all of the minuses and pluses . 
we talk about the fact that , on this occasion taken any decisions until early , &quot; said Ликсутов . 
заммэра emphasized that for authorities the capital is very important experience of Asian cities , which structure and usage are similar with Moscow . 
one of the decisions taken in these countries , is already exercised by the construction of the ring road , added Ликсутов . 
recently , since the Central ring road project is an example of the fact that not all traffic pass through Moscow . 
if there was sufficient infrastructure объезда , you don &apos;t need to have transit traffic in Moscow , &quot; said заммэра . 
also , Maxim Ликсутов said that the introduction of paid parking significantly разгрузило metropolitan streets . 
and , in his words , authorities do not plan to stop there . 
recall , on August 26 , the mayor of the Russian capital , Sergei Sobyanin take part in the ceremony or the construction of the first complex of Moscow &apos;s central ring road ( ЦКАД ) . 
boredom sinful 
the film Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez &apos;s &quot; City грехов-2 : woman , for which is killing &quot; was not the revolution that it might have been expected . 
the first &quot; City of sins &quot; ( 2005 ) , at minimum , but symbolic , the participation of Tarantino , a revolution in the relationship between movies , comic books and literary нуаром . 
the sequel , too , in its own way revolutionary , in the sense that it erodes fundamental to modern thinking chain &quot; thesis - антитезис &quot; synthesis &quot; ( if you understand as a thesis universe нуара , and by antithesis - space comic ) . 
from now on , it should read : &quot; thesis - антитезис &quot; chaos . &quot; 
&quot; the city грехов-2 &quot; хаотичен and драматургическом , and the philosophical level , both times he хаотичен in a bad mood . 
yes , some of the characters are familiar with the &quot; City &quot; , although that громила Марв ( Mickey Рурк ) , I remember , had finished , life in the electric chair , and then , nothing , only enough time to rile - in the role of этакого folk дружинника - from air knives and axes удавками . 
but old men literally расталкивают elbows newcomers like вломившиеся into the city from some other movie , about the meaning and plot which spectators are asked not to worry . 
so , its own history , his clothes tattered and torn authors in an interesting spot , суперудачливого player Johnny ( Joseph Gordon-Levitt &apos;s ) . 
editorial - похотливо-фригидной Eve Lord ( Eva Green ) and for something мстящего her Dwight ( Josh Бролин ) . 
but this confusion , in which Dwight in , say , a person not to distinguish from Johnny , the more that person , as well as other parts of the body , the characters to destroy with implacable arming regularity , &quot; not a problem , and not even only half the problem . 
it &apos;s not people , we understand that these archetypes нуара : the fatal smoothly , too confident player угодивший in &quot; медовую trap &quot; sex detective , corrupt упырь-сенатор . 
Oh , and when an archetype вальсирует with an archetype and an archetype погоняет , then this is not a movie , and read that abstract painting . 
but ask an abstract painting , questions about the logic of the story is simply ridiculous . 
besides , even in this суматошном world is something permanent . 
fighting whore from the first &quot; City &quot; still keep circular defense from осаждающих their native Chinese forces of darkness . 
yes , and the ghost of detective Хартигана no , yes and came to light , and for Bruce Willis it &apos;s always nice to look at . 
the main problem , &quot; Cities грехов-2 &quot; is another . 
Frank Miller was good , because both рисовальщик bed joined comic and нуар , and as a director , turned an idea of how to comic books to the screen . 
comic and нуар - two aggressively opposing &quot; reality . &quot; 
a phenomenon localized in the modern form was born in the late 1920s , at the same time , when novels Дэшила Хэммета &apos; computer &apos; harvest &apos; ( 1929 ) , &quot; went &quot; ( 1930 ) and &quot; Стеклянный key &quot; ( 1931 ) created a canon нуара , именовавшегося then hard-boiled converge - &quot; cool school &quot; . 
well , or other defects . 
comics have 41 many dozens of heroes : from морячка Попая - пожирателя youngish , giving him богатырскую force , Superman Returns , Batman and сыскаря Dick Tracy to Халка , Thor , Spider-Man and other &quot; мстителей . &quot; 
but in any film based on the comic book was something ущербное : characters are stubbornly unwilling обрастать on-screen flesh remained притворяшками in surrounding them willy-nilly , &quot; real &quot; world . 
put simply , they were left without &quot; existence . &quot; 
нуар , in contrast , was the most existential genre of world literature . 
after the world wars the traditional novel - with the experiences and personalities , family scandals and historical background - has lost all credibility . 
what Форсайты what Тибо and Ругон-Маккары which even Болконские and attended generally мыслимы after Вердена , Auschwitz and Hiroshima ?

when looking at the &quot; City of sins , &quot; consider yourself to be a prisoner in a glass ball , inside the snow falls asleep toy клоаку . 
however , more often than not it &apos;s not the snow , and bloody ошметки , but by and large what &apos;s the difference ?

Putin demands from Kiev to start negotiations on the &quot; statehood &quot; of eastern Ukraine 
according to Russian news reports about his comments , Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government has stopped fighting with separatists in the east of the country and immediately started negotiations on the &quot; statehood &quot; отделившегося region . 
his spokesman , Dmitry Peskov , later discloses that Putin had in mind the hint that восточноукраинская territory controlled by separatists will become part of Russia , but that her status within Ukraine should be revised to give русскоговорящему region the opportunity to defend their rights and interests . 
however , calling Putin to furious the Government to start negotiations with the government-controlled insurgents as with equal corresponds to the obvious strategy , which he follows from the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago : to help rebels take territory and force the Ukrainian government give новопровозглашенной territory Новороссии de facto independence , to closer ties with Russia rather than with the West . 
in an interview with the state-controlled Channel 1 television , Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return retained the separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions , both of which were seized in March and April , after Moscow be much stricter in Europe Ukrainian peninsula Crimea on March 18 . 
the Kremlin and the separatists recently named captured territory Новороссией , or New Russia , the name , which refers to the дореволюционным days of glory of the Russian Empire . 
Putin has said that anyone who believes that peace talks will occur in the near future , as Ukrainian politicians to campaign for parliamentary elections on October 26 , and while government troops attack peace settlement in detained separatists regions , &quot; пленник illusions &quot; , according to Itar-Tass . 
&quot; we must immediately begin substantive talks and not only on technical issues , but also on the political organization of society and the public status of Southeast Ukraine , in order to serve the interests of the people living there , &quot; he said . 
Peskov said that Putin &apos;s about statehood had in mind in the context of a broader autonomy that was discussed during months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to allay fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and language rights at risk . 
only the Ukrainian government may give eastern regions the necessary autonomy , Peskov said . 
it is not a matter for discussion between Russia and Ukraine , Peskov said , &quot; because this is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine , and an internal Ukrainian conflict . &quot; 
interference with press secretary the Kremlin to rectify &quot; incorrect interpretation &quot; words , Putin stressed the decision of the Russian leadership to behave towards the separatist rebellion in the east in any other way than to open the seizure of Crimea , where the majority of 2-миллионного population are ethnic Russians . 
Moscow would have to endure much more heavy battle to attach even Donetsk and Луганскую region of eastern Ukraine , as the majority of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian , and polls before the start of the conflict , showed broad support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine . 
autonomy , which Russian diplomats discussed at international forums gave regional governments in the Ukraine power themselves to trade agreements and foreign policy , in effect giving the Kremlin de facto control over the territory , which would have combined the main Russian territory with the situation . 
the Black Sea peninsula , присоединенном five months ago , which is the main Russian military fleet , as well as commercial marine institutions and historical sea resorts . 
in regions between Russia &apos;s Rostov region and the situation also are mines , mills and casting plants that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army . 
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has proposed in his inaugural address June 7 , to Ukrainian lawmakers after new elections weighed an amendment to the constitution that would allow give отделившимся regions greater control of their finances and the status of the languages . 
however , his opinion on autonomy , it seems , is very different from the view of the Kremlin and повстанцев-сепаратистов , ITAR-Tass and abetting which accuse Moscow . 
last call for Putin to Kiev to negotiate with the leaders of the separatists , as with equal , followed by new наступлениями rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks rolled into eastern Ukraine out of the formerly peaceful area along the Sea of Azov . 
supported by Russian separatists took control of the city Новоазовск in the offensive of the Ukrainian security services say they are afraid that he is starting a campaign to capture the strategic coastal territory to the Crimea . 
this led to a large-scale civilian and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol , a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants , which is located between Новоазовском and narrow 27 on the Crimean peninsula . 
Poroshenko on Saturday addressed the meeting of leaders of the European Union in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine , the former Soviet republic , which was independent of 23 years . 
&quot; we are approaching a point of no return came , &quot; warned Poroshenko . 
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on Ukrainian territory . 
EU summit had not taken certain measures ; leaders urged to draw up a project more harsh sanctions against Russia , which will be taken in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis . 
Ukrainian soldiers were forced to withdraw from their positions in Иловайске after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 troops last week in Donetsk region , in order to support the judicial difficulties separatists , Colonel Андрий Lysenko , a spokesman for the Council for National Security and Defense of Ukraine , told reporters in Kiev on Saturday .

researchers have found evidence of another of his hypothesis : physically strong people often get angry and switch to pitch invasions , consider themselves entitled to impose other accept unpleasant conditions for them , and they prefer the methods of solving conflicts peacefully . 
starting from that anger is primarily &quot; emotion bargaining , &quot; the scientists decided that movements of each of the seven groups of muscles , creating сердитое expression must represent гневающегося individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor , and thereby force as soon as possible to agree to its terms in order to avoid conflict . 
to test this hypothesis , the researchers modelled on a computer , where they had or absent each of seven elements гневного faces , and showed them may be . 
although by climbing in the eyebrows or but shutting down discussion simply means forward , chin individually do face evil , then this with such traits of man stronger physically , study participants acknowledged unanimously . 
the anger of a man , like animals , expresses a threat : an exaggerated manifestation of his own forces , the reaffirmation to agree and to obey . 
man inflated nostrils and поджимает lips with the same goal , and that frog , which надувается or бабуин , which demonstrates their fangs . 
&quot; anger &quot; runs &quot; refusal to listen to accept the situation , and the face immediately takes shape , effectively has demonstrated the opposite side of the consequences of this failure . 
but the most striking is that none of the components гневного faces is not arbitrary , they are one and the same , &quot; said anthropologist John Туби .
